[{"title": "Ryan Zinke’s Primary Struggles Thrust Montana Into Midterm Spotlight", "text": "Ryan Zinke seemingly had it all: President Donald Trump’s “full endorsement,” name recognition and political clout at home, and lots and lots of campaign cash.The former Navy SEAL, congressman and Trump administration interior secretary was widely expected to cruise to victory in the Republican primary for Montana’s new House seat on Tuesday. Instead he floundered, barely eking out a win over Al Olszewski, a former state senator and hard-line conservative who painted Zinke as a self-serving liberal who “quit” Trump.The Associated Press called the race for Zinke late Thursday after a delay in Lincoln Country. Zinke defeated Olszewski by just over 1,600 votes, or 1.9 percentage points.In a statement, Zinke thanked voters for their “confidence that America can be fixed and for ignoring the political BS.”Zinke’s unimpressive performance sets the stage for what could prove to be a competitive midterm race as Republicans look to regain the majority in the House.“Logic would say the District 1 seat may be more in play during the general election,” said Chuck Johnson, a retired journalist who covered Montana politics for more than four decades. “It likely will be one of the most-watched House races nationally.”But Johnson stressed there are many factors — campaign messaging and tactics, fundraising and dark-money influence, and the extent to which national party committees get involved, if at all — that will determine just how tight things get.Montana’s new House district, which covers the western part of the state, was created last year to account for population growth in Big Sky Country. It is the first time Montana has had two House seats since 1993.When western Montanans head to the polls in November, they will be faced with two very different choices. Zinke, the muscle of Trump’s fossil fuel-centric “energy dominance” agenda who has made a small fortune consulting for oil, gas and mining interests since resigning under a cloud of scandal in early 2019, will square off against Monica Tranel, a rancher, two-time Olympic rower and environmental lawyer who successfully helped sue Northwest Energy over a 2007 Montana law that gave the utility giant pre-approval to construct energy projects.Tranel trounced the Democratic field on Tuesday — a race that many longtime political observers in Montana expected to be the more competitive of the primaries.In a statement after her win, Tranel took a swing at her expected GOP opponent, saying that Democrats and Republicans alike made clear on Tuesday that “they want a representative in Congress to represent them, rather than corporations that exploit them.”“Ryan Zinke had multiple chances to show up for Montanans, but instead of serving Montana, he served himself,” she said. “Zinke’s record of corruption has contributed to a primary result that shows his own party does not trust him.”Zinke was one of five candidates on the Republican ticket Tuesday. He campaigned as if he was a shoo-in for the Republican nomination, given his Trump credentials and previous stint as Montana’s at-large House member. He largely avoided talking to the press, with the exception of right-wing outlets, and did not show up for a single primary candidate forum, including one last month in his hometown of Whitefish. Through mid-May, he had raised nearly $3 million, far more than any other candidate in the race, and outspent everyone in the field by 2-to-1 or more.In the end, nearly 60% of Republican voters ultimately cast their ballot for someone other than Zinke. Many of those votes will be up for grabs in November.Even more notable, Zinke got walloped in his home county of Flathead, tallying just 31.5% of the vote to Olszewski’s 47.8%, according to the latest returns.“He is wounded, for sure. He’s vulnerable,” said Evan Barrett, a longtime Democratic policy and economic adviser in Montana who is now assisting with Tranel’s campaign. “I think that, obviously, the positives that come with being a high-level person in the Trump administration appear to be offset by the negatives that come with the ethical lapses that have been widely publicized.”There are signs that Zinke’s camp knew it might be in trouble. In March and April, his campaign paid a public opinion research firm more than $50,000 to conduct voter surveys, expenditures show. And in the three days before the primary, western Montana voters received text messages that attacked Olszewski as “the wrong choice for Montana Conservatives,” according to copies of the texts a Montana resident shared with HuffPost.One of the texts included a pre-recorded voice memo from Donald Trump Jr.“There’s a better choice,” Trump Jr. said in the recording. “Republican Ryan Zinke is the true conservative Montanans can trust. That’s why my father, President Donald Trump, endorsed Ryan Zinke, because he’s the right choice for Congress.”The text message ads were paid for by More Jobs, Less Government, a super PAC with ties to both Zinke and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). Daines also endorsed Zinke in the Montana House race.William Foley — the billionaire founder and chair of title insurance company Fidelity National Financial and owner of the Vegas Golden Knights, an NHL franchise — is one of More Jobs, Less Government PAC’s largest funders. He gave the PAC $300,000 during the 2020 election cycle. That year, the PAC spent $895,000 opposing Daines’ challenger, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock.Foley, his wife and other Fidelity National employees have so far donated a combined $27,450 to Zinke’s current congressional bid, Federal Election Commission records show. That’s on top of the nearly $200,000 that employees and political action committees affiliated with the company reportedly contributed to Zinke’s previous two congressional campaigns.Zinke is best known as a face of Trump-era swampiness and corruption. He played an outsize role in advancing the Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel, anti-environmental agenda and racked up nearly 20 federal investigations into his conduct and policy decisions. One of those probes targeted his use of private planes at taxpayers’ expense, including when he and staffers chartered an oil company plane for a flight from Las Vegas to Montana. That flight, which cost more than $12,000, followed a “motivational speech” Zinke gave to the Vegas Golden Knights.The scandals ultimately caught up with him, and he resigned as interior chief in January 2019 — one day before Democrats took control of the House and the oversight authority that comes with it.Zinke has repeatedly dismissed the internal probes against him as “politically motivated attacks” and falsely claimed that he was cleared of all wrongdoing. And on the campaign trail in recent months, he all but promised to get revenge if elected and if Republicans take back the majority in the House of Representatives in November.“I think we need to hold people accountable, particularly in the Biden administration. It seems there is a lot there between Hunter Biden and the president himself,” Zinke told right-wing outlet Newsmax earlier this week. “I think we need to investigate some egregious acts, but I would say be [judicious] in our investigation and not abuse the power ... Just because the other team lies, cheats and steals, we should not bow to that bait.”Interior’s internal watchdog concluded in a report in February that Zinke had violated ethics rules and misused his office through his continued involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, and then lied to investigators about it.Following his departure from the Trump administration, Zinke cashed in with the fossil fuel interests he’d spent two years regulating. A financial disclosure his campaign filed in November, months after it was due, revealed that Zinke was paid a combined $1.36 million for consulting and other services in the two years after leaving the Trump administration. That included $460,000 from oil giant ConocoPhillips, $135,000 from U.S. Gold Corp. and at least $5,000 each from several other fossil fuel interests. A good chunk of that income flowed in while Zinke was on the campaign trail railing against President Joe Biden for high gas prices, peddling industry talking points and touting his energy bona fides.Zinke’s industry ties, ethical shortfalls and ties to California — Politico reported last month that his wife designated a home she inherited in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence — took center stage in the primary. In a campaign ad released late last month, Olszewski highlighted several of Zinke’s scandals while at the Interior Department and declared that “flying high on the taxpayer dime isn’t cowboy, it’s California.”Those same issues will no doubt be fodder for attack ads in the coming months.As HuffPost reported this week, in the course of Zinke’s 14-year political career, he has shifted from a moderate, conservation-minded Republican to a hard-line conservative handcuffed to Trumpian ideology. When Newsmax asked Zinke earlier this month about the importance of Trump’s endorsement, he said the former president is “either going to be a king or a kingmaker.” And he dismissed Olszewski’s claim that he’s too liberal to represent Montana.“I don’t think President Trump endorses RINOs,” he said, referring to so-called “Republicans in name only.”Zinke still heads into the general election as the favorite. More than 26,000 more votes were cast in the Republican primary than in the Democratic primary for the western district. FiveThirtyEight.com gave Republicans a 10-point advantage to win the seat in November.In 2020, Trump won Montana by 16 points and Democrats lost every single statewide race.But Zinke’s primary performance has clearly energized Montana Democrats.“While Democrats are united around Monica Tranel and already gearing up for November, the Republicans start the race off in disarray,” Shelia Hogan, executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, said in a statement Wednesday when the race was still too close to call.Jayson O’Neill, a conservation consultant and former aide to former Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, said the primary revealed a schism among Republican voters in western Montana. He expects the results this week could bump the race to one of the top House battles of the midterms.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee maintains a “Districts in Play” list; Montana’s new House district is not currently on it, but some anticipate the committee could come to see the new Montana House seat as an opportunity.“It’s a big referendum that says people are fed up with Zinke, and they are willing to vote for pretty much anybody else,” O’Neil said."}, {"title": "Yellowstone Bison Face Endangered Species Act Review", "text": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will spend the next year assessing whether to protect Yellowstone bison under the Endangered Species Act — a court-mandated move that could upend recent attempts to reestablish wild herds on tribal reservations across the west.The decision, published in the federal register by the Fish and Wildlife Service on Monday, stems from a series of lawsuits brought by the Buffalo Field Campaign and the Western Watersheds Project since 2014. Both groups want to see bison numbers in the park rise and hope to halt systematic culling outside Yellowstone National Park, which in some years has claimed more than 1,000 bison.“Bison are forced into boundaries,” said James Holt, the executive director of the Buffalo Field Campaign. “They’re slaughtered. They’re quarantined. The North American model of wildlife conservation is failing bison and we can do better.”The decision came as a surprise to many observers of Yellowstone bison, given how well the animals are doing by historical standards.“Market hunters” killed the animals en masse toward the end of the 19th century to sell their hides and tongues, nearly driving the animals to extinction. Only about two dozen bison lived in Yellowstone by 1902, according to the National Park Service.Conservation efforts since then, however, have helped Yellowstone’s bison rebound to around 5,500 today.“The Endangered Species Act is really designed to keep animals from becoming extinct,” said Jay Bodner, executive vice president of the Montana Stock Growers Association. “With a population of 5,500 on a growth trend, they certainly are not in that class.”The Fish and Wildlife Service has generally agreed, declining to recommend bison for Endangered Species Act protections twice in response to the lawsuits.But U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss found in January that the federal agency failed to consider recent genetic studies indicating that Yellowstone bison have evolved into two distinct herds, which in turn might warrant separate, higher population targets to protect genetic diversity.The Fish and Wildlife Service’s third assessment, conducted in response to Moss’s ruling, called for a year-long review of the petition to protect Yellowstone’s bison based on their genetic diversity.Endangered Species Act protections could have far-reaching and politically explosive impacts, if the Fish and Wildlife Service were to adopt them.Wild bison migrate long distances. Yellowstone bison typically push north along the river bottom when snow begins to fall, following forage to lower-elevation winter range, moving through private land in the process.But around 60% of wild bison carry brucellosis ― a bacterial disease brought to North America by beef cattle. Brucellosis exposure can devastate ranches, creating pressure to keep the animals away from domestic cattle as they migrate.“If Yellowstone bison could roam freely with the infection rate they have, our livestock trading partners would put severe restrictions on Montana,” Bodner said.To keep that from happening, federal and state agencies try to push bison toward public land as much as they can and haze them back into the park when they return to their summer range.Authorities also kill hundreds of Yellowstone bison each year and distribute the meat and hides to tribes, largely to ease tensions over brucellosis with ranchers and conflicts with other private property owners outside the park.It’s an awkward arrangement few are happy with. Montana conducts a highly coveted draw to hunt wild bison exiting the park, in which thousands apply for the chance at a few dozen licenses. Several tribes, exercising treaty rights, also hunt bison just outside the park under their own regulations.Historically, government authorities killed far more bison than hunters. Authorities culled about 1,115 Yellowstone bison in the winter of 2017-18, according to court filings.But over the last three years, the National Park Service has quarantined a small number of bison at the park to certify them as free from brucellosis, a process that requires multiple tests over more than a year.Under the Bison Conservation Transfer Program, the National Park Service has worked with tribes across the country to ship live bison to help establish new herds or bolster existing ones. The National Park Service plans to double the capacity of the program in coming years, partly as an alternative to sending bison to slaughter. Last year, the number of culled bison had dropped to 187.Extending Endangered Species Act protections could upend that program, and may threaten tribal nations’ treaty rights, according to Eastern Shoshone Tribal Buffalo Representative James Baldes.Baldes spent the last 15 years restoring the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s buffalo herd. He called the transfer program a “success story that has restored many Yellowstone buffalo to tribes across the nation, and even to Alaska,” including his.“To list bison as an endangered species or a threatened species would greatly diminish the efforts to restore bison to tribal lands lands for cultural and ecological restoration,” Baldes said. “We know the genetics of Yellowstone are very important. We want to make sure that we’re getting those animals alive to ensure herd health.”Fights over whether to list a given animal under the Endangered Species Act are often more about politics than biology, according to South Dakota bison rancher Dan O’Brien, author of “Buffalo for the Broken Heart.”Like many others, he viewed the pressure to list bison as a threatened species with suspicion. But the law was also designed to respond to petitions with scientific assessments. Only scientific research can tell whether Yellowstone bison have genetics demanding extra protection.“I’ve worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service my entire life and they want to do the right thing,” O’Brien said. “I think we have to stand back and let the Act work.”"}, {"title": "Galapagos Tortoise From Species Thought Extinct For 100 Years Is Found", "text": "Researchers confirmed Thursday that a lone giant tortoise found wandering on an active volcano in the Galapagos is actually the only known member of a species thought to have become extinct more than 100 years ago.Scientists first found a female giant tortoise on the Galapagos’ Fernandina Island, which consists of a largely unexplored volcano, in 2019 in a clump of vegetation amid extensive lava fields. Though researchers had hoped to find a member of the species Chelonoidis phantasticus, also known as the fantastic giant tortoise, they expected the tortoise was actually a different species that may have been moved or carried to the island by a hurricane, rather than a native creature.They dubbed her Fernanda.To help uncover the mystery of Fernanda’s origin, researchers at Princeton and Yale fully sequenced Fernanda’s genome as well as the genome from the only other specimen of Chelonoidis phantasticus known to science, collected in 1906, and compared the data to every other living Galapagos giant tortoise species.“We saw — honestly, to my surprise — that Fernanda was very similar to the one that they found on that island more than 100 years ago, and both of those were very different from all of the other islands’ tortoises,” Stephen Gaughran, a co-author of a paper published Thursday in the journal Communications Biology.The “fantastic” element refers to the shape of the males’ shells, which feature “extreme flaring along the outer edge and conspicuous saddlebacking at the front.” Fernanda is thought to be “well over” 50 years old, but the researchers said the island’s limited vegetation may have stunted her growth.They said scat and tracks show there may be two or three other tortoises on the island, raising hopes that Fernanda’s line could continue. She now lives at the Galapagos National Park Tortoise Center, a breeding and rescue facility.“The finding of one alive specimen gives hope and also opens up new questions, as many mysteries still remain,” Adalgisa Caccone, a research scientists at Yale and an author of the study, said in a statement. “Are there more tortoises on Fernandina that can be brought back into captivity to start a breeding program? How did tortoises colonize Fernandina, and what is their evolutionary relationship to the other giant Galápagos tortoises?”All 14 species of Galapagos tortoises are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of threatened species as either vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered or extinct. Populations were decimated by European explorers who hunted them for food, taking the tortoises aboard their ships, since they could survive with little effort and serve as a source of fresh meat for sailors."}, {"title": "Hero Dog Dies Weeks After Saving Owner From Mountain Lion Attack", "text": "A dog hailed as a hero for saving her owner’s life during a recent mountain lion attack in northern California has died.Eva, a Belgian Malinois, began having seizures over the weekend, owner Erin Wilson told The Sacramento Bee. Wilson rushed her beloved pet to get veterinary care, but the 2 1/2-year-old dog continued to get worse and died at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine on Wednesday.Eva’s bravery made national headlines last month. Wilson was walking with Eva in a rural area when a mountain lion lunged at the woman, scratching her shoulder. When Wilson called out for help, Eva doubled back and attacked the mountain lion. The two animals tangled until Eva was able to find a nearby woman for help and the two beat back the cougar from the dog using pepper spray and a piece of PVC pipe, according to SF Gate.“My dog is my hero and I owe her my life,” Wilson wrote on a now-closed GoFundMe page she had created for veterinary expenses after the attack.Eva suffered serious injuries, including two skull fractures, but had been significantly improving prior to her death. She had been released from the veterinarian and photos on Instagram showed her snuggling with new toys and even enjoying a walk outside.The final update on Wilson’s GoFundMe was brief and heartfelt.“We said goodbye,” she wrote. “We love you Eva.

The canyon, one of the largest in the world, is up to 2.5 miles deep in parts and provides habitat for sperm whales, sea turtles, octopuses and deep sea corals.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it would begin a public comment period on the matter and will then consider what it would be called and what areas it would encompass. The full process, which would also include an environmental impact analysis and management plan, could take more than a year, The Washington Post reported.“A sanctuary near one of the most densely populated areas of the Northeast U.S. would connect diverse communities across the region to the ocean and the canyon in new and different ways,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “As someone who grew up in New York City and went on to a career in ocean science, I am excited about how this amazing underwater environment can inspire shared interest in conserving our ocean.”The Interior Department also said Wednesday it would move to phase out the sale of single-use plastics on public lands by 2032, which includes national parks. The agency noted that plastic pollution remains a major problem on public lands, adding that less than 10% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled.“The Interior Department has an obligation to play a leading role in reducing the impact of plastic waste on our ecosystems and our climate,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “As the steward of the nation’s public lands, including national parks and national wildlife refuges, and as the agency responsible for the conservation and management of fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats, we are uniquely positioned to do better for our Earth.”The move was hailed by environmental groups.“Our national parks, by definition, are protected areas — ones that Americans have loved for their natural beauty and history for over a century — and yet we have failed to protect them from plastic for far too long,” Christy Leavitt, the plastics campaign director for Oceana, a nonprofit ocean conservation group, said in a statement. “The Department of Interior’s single-use plastic ban will curb millions of pounds of unnecessary disposable plastic in our national parks and other public lands, where it can end up polluting these special areas.”President Joe Biden campaigned on goals of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known as the “30 by 30” initiative. Those efforts included rolling back former President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle protections for several national monuments, but Biden has also pledged to establish new protected sites to address climate change and safeguard important ecological zones."}, {"title": "Damage Estimates Climb From Massive New Mexico Wildfire", "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The destruction caused by the largest wildfire burning in the U.S. has been devastating for thousands of residents and their lives have been forever disrupted and altered, New Mexico's governor said Tuesday after touring the damage in one county.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham met with homeowners and local officials while surveying homes in two of the many small northern New Mexico villages that were overcome by flames during the past several weeks after two planned government operations meant to clear out overgrown areas of the forest went awry.The first-term Democrat is preparing for a visit Saturday with President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to make a quick stop in New Mexico to be briefed on the wildfires and the recovery efforts.The largest blaze has charred close to 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers) in the Sangre de Cristo mountain range, which sits at the southern edge of the Rocky Mountains. Much criticism has been levied by residents throughout the rural area because of the federal government's role in causing the fire.The governor's office confirmed Tuesday that several hundred homes are estimated to have been destroyed by the fire. That number will likely increase as inspections and documentation is ongoing.“I saw firsthand the irrevocable harm that has been caused, with historic homes and livelihoods lost to the flames,” the governor said in a statement following her tour. “But I was also reminded of New Mexicans’ resiliency — I saw neighbors helping neighbors with that same compassion that New Mexicans always show toward one another in tough times.”The governor also heard about where recovery aid has been helpful and where gaps remain.Lujan Grisham and other top elected officials have called for the federal government to cover 100% of recovery costs. Some also have asked for an independent investigation of the U.S. Forest Service's prescribed fire protocols even though the agency has put a hold on such operations pending its own inquiry.While New Mexico has felt the brunt of the fire season so far this year, much of the West has marked notably hot, dry and windy conditions. Predictions for the rest of the season do not bode well, with drought and warmer weather brought on by climate change worsen fire danger in overgrown forests around the region.The National Interagency Fire Center reported Tuesday that thousands of wildland firefighters were working toward containment of eight large fires that have burned more than 1,130 square miles (2,927 square kilometers). Five of those fires are in New Mexico, while Alaska, Arizona and Colorado each have one.In Alaska, crews were working to protect several structures from a fire burning west of Talkeetna."}, {"title": "Japanese Voyager Defies Age With Tremendous Journey Across Ocean", "text": "Age wasn’t an obstacle for an 83-year-old Japanese oceangoer. In fact, he wants to keep sailing until he’s 100.Kenichi Horie, a yachtsman and the first man to sail solo across the Pacific Ocean, completed a two-month-plus trek across Pacific again on Saturday, The Associated Press reported.Horie, who sailed nonstop across the Pacific Ocean about 60 years ago, started his journey in San Francisco on March 27 and ended it in Japan.His most recent journey makes him the oldest person ever to complete a solo, nonstop trek across the world’s largest ocean, according to The Associated Press.Horie, in an interview with CNN, encouraged people to not let their dreams “stay as dreams.”“Have a goal and work towards achieving this, and a beautiful life awaits,” he said.His journey across the sea was met with challenges, including a storm soon after the start of his voyage and a “pushback from a strong tide,” AP reported.He packed medicine but used only eye drops and bandages.“I’m still in the middle of my youth,” he said.Horie’s 1962 journey inspired the Japanese adventure movie “Alone Across the Pacific” in 1963.He has also circumnavigated the globe from north to south as well as from east to west, used a solar-powered vessel to cross the Pacific Ocean in 1996 and traveled from Hawaii to Japan with a wave-powered boat in 2008.“I want to be a challenger as long as I live,” Horie said."}, {"title": "Biden Under Pressure From Green Groups To Designate His First National Monument", "text": "When the Antiquities Act turned 111 in June 2017, the landmark conservation law was under attack. Then-President Donald Trump had launched a review of more than two dozen national monuments designated or expanded under the act, arguing that recent administrations had abused it to “lock up millions of acres of land and water.” That review ended with Trump dismantling protections for three national monuments — two in Utah and a third off the East Coast.Five years later, dozens of national and local organizations are calling on President Joe Biden to mark the 116th anniversary of the Antiquities Act by establishing a new monument at Castner Range, a former military weapon testing facility in West Texas. The 7,000-acre landscape is home to archaeological sites and a diversity of rare and at-risk wildlife but is off-limits to the public due to unexploded ordnance from years of military testing.In a letter to Biden on Tuesday — a day ahead of the Antiquities Act’s anniversary — a coalition of 92 organizations wrote that doing so would “affirm your commitment to protecting our national treasures as well as help counteract a history of inequitable access to the outdoors.”The coalition includes national environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters and The Wilderness Society, as well as Texas-based organizations like Environment Texas and Frontera Land Alliance.Biden campaigned on a pledge to not only reverse Trump’s unpopular monument rollbacks but establish new protected sites to combat global climate change and safeguard ecologically important landscapes. He’s also set a goal of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, an initiative known informally as “30x30.”In October, Biden followed through on restoring Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, as well as Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the East Coast. But nearly a year and a half into his presidency, to the frustration of some conservation groups, Biden has yet to use his executive power to create a monument of his own.While many sweeping monument designations have proved controversial, particularly in states where the federal government controls large amounts of land, Castner Range has garnered widespread and growing support. In April, for example, the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an organization that represents current and former National Park Service employees, issued a report that identified six “national treasures in need of protection” and lobbied Biden to use his powers under the Antiquities Act. Castner Range was at the top of the group’s list.During a March visit to Castner Range, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland hiked lands adjacent to those being eyed for a future monument and met with local officials “to learn about their vision for increasing access to, and conservation of, outdoor spaces,” the Interior Department said in a press release at the time.Unlike in neighboring New Mexico, there are few open spaces for outdoor enthusiasts to hike and recreate in West Texas, said Janaé Field, executive director of El Paso-based conservation nonprofit Frontera Land Alliance.“There’s just so many people trying to access public spaces, and there’s just not enough room to accommodate all the footprints,” she told HuffPost.Field noted that the effort to protect Castner Range has been ongoing for more than five decades and said the landscape “checks all the boxes” for a national monument.In its letter, the coalition writes that a monument designation would help the Biden administration advance several priorities at once, from combating climate change and safeguarding biodiversity to correcting environmental injustices. Most state and local parks in and around El Paso charge admission fees that “create a significant additional barrier in equitable access” to the outdoors, the coalition writes.Signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act authorizes presidents to “declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments.” Sixteen presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used it to create more than 150 monuments since 1906, including many sites that later became national parks.Field is hopeful that Castner Range will be the first of several national monuments Biden establishes during his presidency.“Hopefully, he ends a 51-year effort,” she said. “But if not, I don’t see the community stopping.”"}, {"title": "Bill Banning Pet Stores From Selling Dogs, Cats And Rabbits Passes New York Legislature", "text": "A bill that would ban pet stores in New York state from selling dogs, cats and rabbits has passed the state legislature and is awaiting the signature of Gov. Kathy Hochul (D).The bill, which passed the legislature this week, is largely aimed at fighting large-scale “puppy mill”-style breeding operations. However, the bill does not directly target these facilities ― many of which exist outside of New York and thus outside the jurisdiction of New York state law. Instead, it focuses on pet stores, which primarily source their pets from such places, according to the animal welfare advocates and lawmakers who back the bill.“Right now, out of state puppy mills ship their puppies via a pipeline of middlemen to New York pet stores, where they are marketed as healthy puppies from responsible breeders,” Maureen Linehan, a spokesperson for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said in an email to HuffPost.The bill encourages pet stores to partner with shelters and rescue groups and to use their retail spaces to “showcase” animals up for adoption.New York’s legislation would not totally prohibit people from purchasing animals from breeders. It would still be legal for breeders to sell animals directly to prospective pet owners; the legislation would only prohibit selling by third-party retailers like pet stores.The bill has support from numerous animal advocacy groups, including the ASPCA, The Humane Society of the United States, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and the New York State Animal Protection Federation, among others.However, the legislation has faced opposition from the pet retail industry, as well as from the American Kennel Club. The AKC routinely advocates against retail pet sale bans, arguing that the laws are “anti-breeder” and hurt consumers in the market for pets.New York state has one of the highest concentrations of pet stores that sell puppies in the country, according to the ASPCA. That makes the bill especially significant.In 2017, California passed a law banning pet shops from selling nonrescue cats, dogs and rabbits. Maryland, Maine, Illinois and Washington state have all since passed similar laws.Additionally, numerous cities and towns across the country have enacted retail pet bans at the local level. Prior to this bill, New York City already banned pet stores from selling rabbits ― though not cats and dogs ― in part because of welfare issues specific to the long-eared animals. Some people mistakenly think of rabbits as low-maintenance “starter pets,” when in reality, they need highly specialized care.One of the country’s most comprehensive retail pet bans is in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where pet stores are barred from selling birds, reptiles, spiders and small mammals like hamsters and gerbils ― unless the animals come from a shelter or rescue group. The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals advocated for the law, citing the poor conditions these animals often experience in high-volume breeding operations."}, {"title": "Charity Accuses Soldiers Of Blow-Dart Attacks On Stray Cats At Hawaii Army Barracks", "text": "An animal rescue outfit in Honolulu said people are shooting blow darts at stray cats around Schofield Army Barracks, suggesting the culprits are soldiers who allegedly purchased the weapons during recent training in Indonesia.

But the act is part of the California Fish and Game Code, which defines a fish as “a wild fish, mollusk, crustacean, invertebrate, amphibian.”Including the word “invertebrate” in the code was enough for bees to buzz through, the court said.“The issue presented here is whether the bumble bee, a terrestrial invertebrate, falls within the definition of fish, as that term is used in the definitions of endangered species,” the court said in the decision.“Although the term fish is colloquially and commonly understood to refer to aquatic species, the term of art employed by the Legislature in the definition of fish in section 45 is not so limited,” the court explained.The challenge to the 2020 ruling was brought by the Stanford Environmental Law Clinic, which represented the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, the Center for Food Safety and Defenders of Wildlife.“We are celebrating today’s decision that insects and other invertebrates are eligible for protection” under the state endangered species act, Sarina Jepsen, the Xerces Society’s director of endangered species, said in a statement.“The court’s decision allows California to protect some of its most endangered pollinators, a step which will contribute to the resilience of the state’s native ecosystems and farms,” Jepsen added."}, {"title": "The Rudest Things You Can Do At The Dog Park", "text": "Going to the dog park is a great way to help your pet socialize, move around and get some fresh air.

In fact, there are several common rude behaviors dog owners display in this context.“Etiquette is all about being mindful of other people, which certainly applies to the dog park,” Nick Leighton, an etiquette expert and co-host of the “Were You Raised by Wolves?” podcast, told HuffPost.To help make the dog park a safe and enjoyable setting for everyone, HuffPost asked Leighton and other etiquette experts to share the faux pas they’ve observed ― and their advice for avoiding these missteps. Here are eight of the rudest things you can do at the dog park.“The rules about picking up after your pet aren’t suspended in a dog park,” Leighton noted.When your dog goes, it’s your responsibility to clean it up, and there’s little excuse for failing to do so.“Most parks are well-supplied with waste pickup bags and plenty of trash cans, so please do your part,” said Camp Bow Wow animal health and behavior consultant Erin Askeland.“Be sure to pay attention to your dog at all times,” Leighton advised.Keep a close eye on what your pup is doing and resist the urge to tune out. Stay vigilant and keep your leash handy in case the two of you need to make an early exit.“In addition to monitoring your dog’s behavior, it’s common courtesy to be sociable with the other pup parents, complimenting them on the cuteness of their canine companion and making pleasant conversation,” said Thomas P. Farley, aka “Mister Manners.” “To let one’s dog roam free while you catch up on email, disengaging with everyone in the enclosure ― including your pet ― is a no-no.”If you’re distracted on your phone, you’ll also miss out on the opportunity to “engage with your dog, practice recall, ensure play is appropriate, provide breaks in play, and monitor your dog’s body language,” Askeland noted.Avoid bringing young children who need constant supervision to the dog park, if possible, as their presence will make it difficult to monitor your dog.“You don’t know the other dogs and need to keep your focus on your own dog,” Askeland said. “Adding small children is dangerous to the child and the dogs in the park.”Toddlers and babies may also be at risk of harm from rowdy dogs, especially if there are animals present who are unfamiliar with little kids.“While at the dog park, people should ensure their dog is interacting with other dogs in an appropriate manner,” said animal behaviorist and consultant Kate Mornement. “Dogs that are aggressive or reactive towards other dogs should not be taken to dog parks. Try to ensure your dog and the other dog it interacts with are having a good time. If your dog is playing too rough with another dog, it’s best to intervene and call your dog away.”Don’t allow your dog to bully other dogs or steal and shred up their toys. Look out for any aggressive, dangerous behavior.“Dog parks are wonderful places for well-behaved and socialized dogs who enjoy the company of other dogs,” Mornement said. “However, not all dogs are well-behaved or socialized and this can cause problems at the dog park.”“In some ways, dog runs can be for canines what Las Vegas is for humans: For these lucky pups, what happens on the dog run stays in the dog run!” Farley said. “Being off-leash, doggies excitedly embrace the rare sensation of liberation. But while dogs will let down their guards, their humans should not. Being aware of securing the dog-run gate while coming and going is rule number one.”Pay attention to the gates at fenced-in dog parks. Many of these have double-gated entrances to prevent off-leash dogs from escaping. Pause before you open a gate, especially if you notice lots of dogs hanging around the area, and look out for any pets trying to make a hasty exit. Be sure to properly close and latch any gates behind you as well.“Don’t give food to other dogs at the park,” Askeland advised. “You don’t know the other dogs and whether or not they can have food you may offer.”On a similar note, don’t bring your own human food to snack on in this space. In addition to potentially endangering other dogs, you probably won’t enjoy being swarmed by pups looking for a snack.Don’t go to the dog park with a canine that is unvaccinated, sick or under 4 months old. In addition to being vulnerable, they might also put other pets at risk. Only bring your dog if they are up to date with their shots and any other requirements the park may have in place.“Make sure your pup is vaccinated and protected against fleas, ticks and other parasites,” Askeland said. “This helps keep other pups safe too.”“Dogs that are fearful and nervous around unfamiliar dogs should also not be taken to dog parks,” Mornement said. “This is because these dogs are not enjoying the dog park environment and this can make their behavior worse.”Make sure your dog’s behavior is appropriate for a dog park before you take them to one.“This is not the place to test whether your dog enjoys playing with other dogs or a place to help a dog learn to play,” Askeland said. “If you’ve recently added a dog to your home, you should wait until your dog has adjusted to his/her home and you have gotten to know your dog and his/her body language and normal interactions before deciding whether the dog park is the right place to visit.”That way, you can watch your dog’s body language at the park and remove them if they’re showing signs that they aren’t comfortable.“Understand that not all dogs are great with a dog park, and it’s OK if your dog does not go to a dog park,” Askeland added."}, {"title": "Pregnant Sea Turtle Attacked By Shark Gets To Deliver Eggs, Endures Surgery", "text": "MIAMI (AP) — A loggerhead turtle whose left fin was destroyed in a shark attack is rehabbing at Zoo Miami’s new Sea Turtle Hospital, where veterinarians were able to save more than 100 of her eggs after she was rescued.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission sent the turtle to the hospital on May 22 after she was found at the Port St. Lucie power plant, Ron Magill, the zoo’s communications director said.An ultrasound determined that the 50-year-old, 388-pound (176-kilograms) turtle was pregnant. She also had scars on the shell that indicated it had been previously hit by a boat and attacked by another shark earlier in life, officials said.The hospital staff stabilized the turtle, dubbed Baymax, in a recovery tank and gave her fluids, vitamins and food that included squid and crab. Then, on Memorial Day, she was moved to a sand-filled pen and given calcium and oxytocin to stimulate her labor. By Tuesday morning she had deposited over 100 eggs. Then they prepared to treat her shark bite injury.During a seven-hour surgery a team led by Zoo Miami associate veterinarian Marisa Bezjian and assisted by chief veterinarian Gwen Myers, the exposed bone was removed and the surrounding wound was cleaned and treated. More eggs also emerged, and like the others, they were taken in a bin of sand to the Miami-Dade Parks Sea Turtle Conservation Program, to incubate in a man-made nest, Magill said.Baymax provided a early launch for the hospital, which recently passed inspection and had permission to accept sick and injured turtles, but won’t officially open until next month, Magill said.While it’s not uncommon for sea turtles to lose limbs to sharks or boat strike, many adjust and lead productive lives. That’s the hope for Baymax. Officials said she’ll be closely monitored for several weeks until she’s healthy enough to return to the wild."}, {"title": "Curious Cougar Corralled In California Classroom", "text": "PESCADERO, Calif.

A meadow of sea grass stretching more than 110 miles long was actually a single plant that had spent the past 4,500 years cloning itself to carpet an area three times larger than Manhattan.The findings, published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, make the colony of Posidonia australis, or ribbon weed, the largest known plant on Earth, scientists said.Elizabeth Sinclair, a senior research fellow at the University of Western Australia and a lead author of the study, said her team has been testing seagrass meadows around Australia for genetic diversity for years to see how they respond to climate change. When her team visited an area known as Shark Bay, a relatively pristine landscape untouched by development, they went beneath the waves to collect samples of seagrass to see what types of plants were growing across the ocean floor.The answer was one.“It’s quite bizarre when you think about it, there’s this plant in one end of the bay and then you move 100 kilometers down to the other end and it’s the same plant,” Sinclair said.Her team hypothesized that thousands of years ago, a single seagrass seedling landed in the bay. It was particularly suited to survive in different oceanic environments due to its unusual genome.Most comparable plant offspring contain 50% of each parent’s genes. But Posidonia australis has 100% from each parent, making it a polyploid, meaning it has double the usual number of chromosomes.“Polyploid plants often reside in places with extreme environmental conditions, are often sterile, but can continue to grow if left undisturbed, and this giant seagrass has done just that,” Sinclair said in a statement. “Even without successful flowering and seed production, it appears to be really resilient, experiencing a wide range of temperatures and salinities plus extreme high light conditions, which together would typically be highly stressful for most plants.”The ribbon weed has slowly grown through a series of runners — like a normal turf lawn — to stretch nearly 80 square miles. The researchers estimate its age at about 4,500 years, based on the species’ size and growth rate.Like other delicate oceanic structures, namely corals, seagrass meadows are susceptible to climate change. A severe heat wave in 2010 and 2011 sparked widespread damage to the Shark Bay meadows, killing about a third of the seagrasses. Underwater meadows are also home to many different species and serve a key role in an area’s biodiversity.“You lose a plant that creates this whole environment and you lose all the biodiversity that goes with it,” Sinclair said, adding that the 2010-2011 event had calamitous effects. “The turtles were going hungry, the dolphins weren’t getting enough fish, the whole network is connected.”Although the ribbon weed has already begun to recover and spread since that event, Sinclair cautioned that climate change still poses a threat to region.She also noted that it was “scary” how researchers had only just discovered the remarkable colony hiding beneath the waves, noting climate change could rip such species away before humans had a chance to discover them.“It’s scary because we might lose it before we find out about it,” Sinclair said. “It might be gone before we even know.”"}, {"title": "Sonic Workers Find An Absolute Nightmare Lurking Just Behind The Fry Machine", "text": "Workers at a Sonic location in Georgia fled the restaurant earlier this month when they found something unexpected behind the deep fryer ― and it wasn’t the remains of some old tots.The Brunswick Daily News reported that the entire staff was spooked by a snake.

Matthew Wilson of the Brunswick Police Department told the newspaper it was actually a 3.5-foot-long ball python, a nonvenomous constrictor snake.“I ended up catching it with a broom handle,” Wilson told the Daily News. “I just got it where I could secure its head. Then I put him in a paper bag and carried him out.”Wilson said he suspects the restaurant left its back door open and the snake slithered in for the same reason as the customers: It was hungry and thirsty.Wilson, who has a ball python of his own, said the Sonic snake has a new home with a snake-loving friend.Eammon Leonard, an invasive species biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, told The Associated Press snakes are often an impulse buy that some purchasers later regret.“It could be somebody just didn’t think through the consequences of a large snake as a pet,” Leonard told AP. “Some people have regrets later on and just release things. It is definitely irresponsible.”People who are no longer able to care for a pet snake should contact a local reptile rescue or animal shelter for advice, and not release them into the wild.

It was moving northeast at 8 mph (13 kph).Near Puerto Angel, gusts of wind, heavy rain and big waves began lashing the beach town of Zipolite, long known for its clothing-optional beach and bohemian vibe.“There is a lot of rain and sudden gusts of strong wind,” said Silvia Ranfagni, the manager of Zipolite’s Casa Kalmar hotel. “The ocean is really stirred up, and it’s raining a lot,” said Ranfagni, who has decided to ride out Agatha at the property. “You can hear the wind howling.”National emergency officials said they had assembled a task force of more than 9,300 people for the area and more than 200 shelters were opened as forecasters warned of dangerous storm surge and flooding from heavy rains.After forming on Sunday, Agatha quickly gained power, and it made landfall as a strong Category 2 hurricane Monday afternoon, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.Agatha is the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in May in the eastern Pacific, said Jeff Masters, meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections and the founder of Weather Underground.He said the region’s hurricanes typically get their start from tropical waves coming off the coast of Africa.“Since the African monsoon typically does not start producing tropical waves until early- or mid-May, there simply aren’t enough initial disturbances to get many eastern Pacific hurricanes in May,” Masters wrote in an email. “In addition, May water temperatures are cooler than they are at the peak of the season, and wind shear is typically higher.”Masters was not sure if Agatha was kicked off by a tropical wave — areas of low pressure that move across the tropics — but the storm has benefitted from warm waters and low wind shear.Late Monday morning, Agatha accelerated slightly, as it moved toward the area near Puerto Escondido and Puerto Angel in the southern state of Oaxaca. The region includes the laid-back tourist resorts of Huatulco, Mazunte and Zipolite.The hurricane center said Agatha could “bring an extremely dangerous storm surge and life-threatening winds.”The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to drop 10 to 16 inches (250 to 400 millimeters) of rain on parts of Oaxaca, with isolated maximums of 20 inches (500 millimeters), posing the threat of flash floods and mudslides.Little change in strength was expected before the storm makes landfall, according to the hurricane center. A hurricane warning was in effect between the port of Salina Cruz and the Lagunas de Chacahua.In Huatulco, municipal authorities cancelled schools and ordered “the absolute closure” of all beaches and its seven bays, many of which are reachable only by boat.The government’s Mexican Turtle Center — a former slaughterhouse turned conservation center in Mazunte — announced it was closed to visitors until further notice because of the hurricane."}, {"title": "How To Take The Ultimate Vacation In Rincón, Puerto Rico", "text": "Take A Break is your ultimate guide to the perfect trips to recharge, rediscover yourself and your relationships, and reengage with the world. We’ll cover shopping stops, great bars, restaurants worth your money, photo opportunities, memorable drives and experiences, and other important details you need before you book.Below, we chat with HuffPost reporter Sarah Ruiz-Grossman about why you’ll want to put Rincón, Puerto Rico on your bucket list.My college roommate Gabriela Hardy is boricua and lives in Rincón with her partner and daughters. Rincón is a small town on the westernmost tip of Puerto Rico, with intimate, palm-tree-lined beaches, the best sunsets, no big hotels, and lots of taco trucks and restaurants overlooking the water. People especially love to surf there, and it has a laid-back, nature-filled vibe.The best months, in my opinion, are winter ― November through April ― after the hurricane season but before the really hot and humid months of summer. You can count on around 85-degree days, balmy 75-degree nights, a lot of sun, and the occasional tropical shower.The easiest way there is to fly into Aguadilla airport and rent a car, driving the 40 minutes or so to Rincón. In Rincón, it’s pretty necessary to have a car as you don’t have easy-access public transport or rideshares. If you’re planning to stay on the island a week or more, you can fly into San Juan and spend a couple days there before driving the 2.5 hours to Rincón.Rincón doesn’t have massive hotels, which is a big part of its charm. It’s more about boutique hotels and Airbnbs. Tres Sirenas is a gorgeous oceanside bed and breakfast, Fisheye View is a rental up in the hills with a nice pool, and Casa en lo Alto is an Airbnb house with great views and a screened-in porch.Rincón is full of great food ― make sure to get in lots of fish tacos, mofongo and açai bowls. Jack’s Shack is the best spot to grab tacos, Cosecha for vegan-friendly lunch, Cafe 2 Go for iced coffee and açai bowls, and Casa Isleña for sunset dinner with a view.There’s not a huge going-out scene in Rincón, but there are plenty of fun bars to grab drinks at. The Beach House is a bar and grill that overlooks the ocean, La Copa Llena also has great views and a bit of a fancier vibe, Tamboo serves drinks right on the beach, and The English Rose has a hilltop brunch with a mean bloody mary.Rincón has an amazing yoga studio called Centro La Paz that has classes, massages and wellness products. Karibe Kombucha is a must-stop for locally made kombucha and yummy superfood blends to take home and add to your morning coffee. Puntas Surf Shop has great beginner surf lessons with rad bathing suits and water sports gear.Maria’s Beach is the perfect, palm-tree-lined beach with few people around and surfers always in the water ― and it serves up a gorgeous sunset.You should definitely drive the 50 minutes to Gozalandia, which has beautiful wood-planked trails to several waterfalls you can swim in.Domes Beach tends to have bigger waves and a perfect sunset, and if you come in the afternoon, you’re almost guaranteed to see surfers riding the swell — a great place to chill.Survival Beach is a 45-minute drive from Rincón. When you park at Surfer’s Beach in Aguadilla, you can take a 20- to 30-minute trail through the jungle to get to Survival Beach, a long, picturesque beach with small waves and tide pools that you can only get to on foot, almost guaranteeing you’ll have most of the shore to yourself.Goggles! When you swim at the local beaches, like Steps Beach, take time to look down in the water and you’re sure to see colorful fish and even the occasional turtle.People in Rincón are really good about wearing masks in public spaces to protect each other from the COVID-19 virus ― it’s a small town where local residents know each other intimately and interact often, so it’s especially important to respect coronavirus guidelines and get fully vaccinated and boosted before traveling, and to mask up while there.I was surprised by just how laid-back the town is. It’s not big, so you get a handle on the layout and the go-to places within a few days, and it makes for a very relaxed time.Rincón, like much of Puerto Rico, is fighting to keep big developers from buying out waterfront properties on public shorelines that drive up housing prices and make the beaches less accessible to all. Be sure to read up on local activists’ fight to preserve the beaches for all and keep the shorelines from environmental destruction."}, {"title": "Inseparable Dog And Pig Pals 'Timon And Pumbaa' Start New Life Together", "text": "A dog and pig should have no worries for the rest of their days after an Arizona animal shelter made sure they found a new home together.Timon, a chihuahua, and Pumbaa, a pig, wound up at the Arizona Humane Society earlier this month after their owner was arrested, the AHS said in a statement sent to HuffPost. The shelter didn’t provide more info on the owner’s arrest, but noted that the charges were unrelated to animal cruelty.It wasn’t long before their deep friendship became apparent to animal shelter staff.“Though it is not always recommended that pigs and dogs live together, this unlikely duo loved to visit each other on occasion during their stay at AHS,” the statement said. “Immediately, AHS staff saw just how strong of a bond these two have, especially when Pumbaa is kind enough to allow Timon to hitch a ride on his back from time to time.”Pumbaa had some medical needs that meant he would need specialized care, so the shelter went about trying to find a pig-centric organization that could take in both creatures.That place turned out to be Better Piggies Rescue, a pig sanctuary in New River, Arizona. While the sanctuary does have pigs up for adoption, it announced this week that Pumbaa and Timon would have a home at the sanctuary permanently ― and that Pumbaa might even have a new job.“He’s a natural greeter,” the sanctuary wrote on Facebook, adding that the gregarious pig would be meeting people when the group resumes public tours in September.Hakuna matata!"}, {"title": "3 Women Found Dead At Chicago Senior Living Home Amid Heat Wave", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) — Temperatures barely climbed into the 90s and only for a couple of days. But the discovery of the bodies of three women inside a Chicago senior housing facility this month left the city looking for answers to questions that were supposed to be addressed after a longer and hotter heat wave killed more than 700 people nearly three decades ago.Now, the city — and the country — is facing the reality that because of climate change, deadly heat waves can strike just about anywhere, don’t only fall in the height of summer and need not last long.“Hotter and more dangerous heat waves are coming earlier, in May ... and the other thing is we are getting older and more people are living alone,” said Eric Klinenberg, a New York University sociologist, who wrote “Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.” about the 1995 heat wave. “It’s a formula for disaster.”The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office has yet to determine the causes of death for the three women whose bodies were found in the James Sneider Apartments on May 14. But the victims’ families have already filed or plan to file wrongful death lawsuits against the companies that own and manage the buildings.The City Council member whose ward includes the neighborhood where the building is located said she experienced stifling temperatures in the complex when she visited, including in one unit where heat sensors hit 102 degrees.“These are senior residents, residents with health conditions (and) they should not be in these conditions,” Alderman Maria Hadden said in a Facebook video shot outside the apartments.Part of the problem, experts say, is that communities nationwide are still learning how deadly heat can be. In Chicago, it took the sight of refrigerated trucks being filled with dead bodies after the 1995 heat wave to drive home the message that the city was woefully unprepared for a silent and invisible disaster that took more than twice as many lives as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.That realization led to a system in which city workers start calling the elderly and frail, and turn city buildings into 24-hour cooling centers when temperatures become oppressive.What happened this month is a reminder that the safeguards in place to make sure people don’t freeze to death because they have not paid their heating bills often do not exist to prevent people from overheating in their homes.“We have nothing for air conditioning,” Hadden said.One expert isn’t surprised.“We recognize people need heating in cold weather and set up programs, financial assistance, to enable that but we don’t do that for cooling,” said Gregory Wellenius, a Boston University professor of environmental health who has studied heat-related deaths. “But subsidies for cooling are really controversial (because) for many people cooling is seen as a luxury item.”In Chicago, Hadden said the building’s management company believed it was not allowed to turn off the heat and turn on the air conditioning until June 1, because of the city’s heat ordinance. But while she said the ordinance has no such requirement, the explanation may at least be a signal that the ordinance should be amended to better protect vulnerable people from heat.Wellenius said statistics show that while well over 80% of homes in cities such as Dallas and Phoenix have air conditioning, the percentage is far lower in cities like Boston and New York.And in the Pacific Northwest, the percentage is even lower, something that came into stark relief in Oregon, Washington and western Canada last June, when temperatures climbed as high as 118 degrees Fahrenheit, killing 600 people or more.There is encouraging news.“More people have air conditioning and we are more aware of the health risks of heat waves,” Klinenberg said.Still, there is evidence that people don’t appreciate or even know just how dangerous the heat can be.In a study published in 2020, Wellenius and other researchers estimated that nationwide about 5,600 deaths a year could be attributed to high heat — eight times more than the 700 heat-related deaths that are study found were officially reported each year.Wellenius said the reasons for what he called a “gross miscalculation” begin with the fact that official statistics are simply the result of counting death certificates that list heat as the cause of death.In the county that includes Chicago, for example, the medical examiner’s office reported two heat-related deaths last year, and seven the year before.Just how many deaths in the U.S. are heat related today is unclear. Wellenius’ study, published in 2020, is the result of research from 1997 to 2006. And Klinenberg said the issue has been complicated by the pandemic.“It’s hard to distinguish excess heat deaths from COVID deaths,” he said.Still, Hadden knows something must be done to deal with heat that can hit earlier and later in the year than it once did.“We have to plan for this,” she said.Klinenberg wonders if cities will follow up on such talk.“Heat never feels like the most important thing in cities and by the time it feels like the most important thing it is too late to do anything about it,” he said."}, {"title": "New Mexico's Largest Wildfire Linked To Planned Burns", "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Two fires that merged to create the largest wildfire in New Mexico history have both been traced to planned burns set by U.S. forest managers as preventative measures, federal investigators announced Friday.The findings shift responsibility more squarely toward the U.S. Forest Service for initiating a natural disaster that has destroyed at least 330 homes as flames raged through nearly 500 square miles (1,300 square kilometers) of high-altitude pine forests and meadows. The wildfire also has displaced thousands of residents from rural villages with Spanish-colonial roots and high poverty rates, while unleashing untold environmental damage.Roughly 3,000 firefighters, along with water-dropping planes and helicopters, continue to fight the blaze as it approaches mountain resorts and Native American communities. Firefighting costs already surpass $132 million, climbing by $5 million a day.Fire and law enforcement officials offered a cautious but hopeful Friday night status report, with fire behavior analyst Stewart Turner noting they need to watch the so-called “red flag” conditions — warm, dry weather with high winds — starting Saturday.“The weather is a big concern for us,” Turner acknowledged, saying even an errant pine cone rolling down a slope and crossing a control line could spread flames. “Red flag warning is a big message for tomorrow.”He said dry conditions are expected through Tuesday, but some moisture and even thunderstorms are possible starting Wednesday.Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernández described a rising sense of outrage as the fire triggers new evacuations of families and livestock. Fear of flames is giving way to concern about erosion and mudslides in places were superheated fire penetrates soil and roots.“The destruction these two fires caused is immeasurable and will be felt for generations,” said Leger Fernández, sponsor of a bill that would reimburse residents and businesses routed by the fire.The Forest Service has not yet released detailed planning documents for the original planned burns that might indicate whether fire protocols were followed.Scientist and forest managers are racing to develop new tools to forecast the behavior of planned fires amid climate change and an enduring drought in the American West. The intentionally set blazes, known as prescribed burns, are aimed at limiting the accumulation of timber and underbrush that, if left unattended, can fuel extremely hot and destructive wildfires.The Biden administration announced in January a $50 billion plan to stave off catastrophic wildfires that would more than double the use of planned fires and logging to reduce trees and other vegetation that serve as tinder in the most at-risk areas. Prescribed burns often are used in wildland areas that are too vast to thin by hand or machine.The two fires east of Santa Fe joined in April to form the massive blaze at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains, in the Sangre de Cristo range.One of the fires was previously traced to April 6, when a planned burn, set by firefighters to clear out small trees and brush, was declared out of control.On Friday, investigators said they had tracked the source of the second fire to the remnants of a planned winter fire that lay dormant through several snowstorms only to flare up again last month.Investigators said the prescribed “pile burn” was initiated in January at Gallinas Canyon in the Santa Fe National Forest outside Las Vegas, New Mexico, and concluded in the final days of that month. Fire was reported again in the same vicinity April 9 and escaped control 10 days later amid dry, hot and windy conditions, Forest Service investigators found.Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in a statement called the investigation results a \"first step toward the federal government taking full responsibility\" for the New Mexico wildfire. She highlighted her pending request to President Joe Biden to direct the Federal Emergency Management Administration to pay for 100% of costs related to a broad range of recovery efforts.Forest Service Chief Randy Moore last week announced a 90-day pause and review of protocols for planned fires that limit the buildup of flammable vegetation. He cited extreme fire danger and unfavorable weather and did not specifically link the review to New Mexico's fires.“It will also ensure the prescribed burn program nationwide is anchored in the most contemporary science, policies, practices and decision-making processes, and that employees, partners and communities have the support they need to continue using this critical tool to confront the wildfire crisis,” the agency said in a statement Friday.Moore said prescribed fires go as planned in more than 99% of cases. Notable exceptions include the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire that swept through national security installations and residential neighborhoods at Los Alamos.So-called pile burns can often include wildland debris collected over months or even years. Forest managers cut back trees and gather debris into mounds, preferring to burn forest fuels in the winter when planned burns are easier to control.In January, Santa Fe National Forest workers started burning through a series of piles across an area of 0.6 square miles (1.5 square kilometers), after advising the public of possible smoke hazards.___Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/ Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) — Firefighters have rescued an abandoned newborn elk calf found amid the ashes of the nation’s largest wildfire as calving season approaches its peak in New Mexico and fires rage across the American West.Missoula, Montana-based firefighter Nate Sink said Tuesday that he happened upon the motionless elk calf on the ground of a fire-blackened New Mexico forest as he patrolled and extinguished lingering hot spots.“The whole area is just surrounded in a thick layer of ash and burned trees. I didn’t think it was alive,” said Sink, who was deployed to the state to help contain a wildfire that by Wednesday had spread across 486 square miles (1,260 square kilometers) and destroyed hundreds of structures.It’s is one of five major uncontained fires burning in New Mexico amid extremely dry and windy conditions. More than 3,000 firefighters battling the biggest blaze have made significant progress halting its growth in recent days ahead of more dangerous fire conditions forecast to return into the weekend, crew commanders said Wednesday night.Wildlife officials in general discourage interactions with elk calves that are briefly left alone in the first weeks of life as their mothers forage at a distance. Sink says he searched diligently for traces of the calf’s mother and found none.The 32-pound (14.5-kilogram) singed bull calf, dubbed “Cinder,” was taken for care to a nearby ranch and is now regaining strength at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Espanola, north of Santa Fe.Veterinarian Kathleen Ramsay at Cottonwood Rehab says she paired Cinder with a full-grown surrogate elk to be raised with as little human contact as possible.“They do elk things, they don’t do people things,” said Ramsay, noting Cinder arrived at a tender days-old age with his umbilical cord still attached.Ramsay said the calf hopefully can be released into the wild in December after elk-hunting season. The strategy has worked repeatedly with elk tracked by tags as they rejoined wild herds.The calf’s rescue was reminiscent of events 70 years ago in New Mexico involving a scalded black bear cub and the fire prevention mascot “Smokey Bear.”The U.S. fire-safety campaign took on new urgency in 1950 with the rescue by firefighters of a black bear cub that was badly burned by wildfire in southern New Mexico. The cub — named Smokey Bear after the mascot — recovered and lived at the National Zoo until its death in 1976.Wildfires have broken out this spring in multiple states in the West, where climate change and an enduring drought are fanning the frequency and intensity of forest and grassland fires.Crews battling the biggest U.S. fire in northern New Mexico took advantage of one last day of favorable weather Wednesday before hotter, drier and windier conditions are forecast to return late Thursday and continue to worsen into next week.“All across the fire, we’re making a lot of really good progress over the last few days,” incident commander Carl Schwope said at a briefing Wednesday night.“We do have some more critical fire weather moving in ... starting now and getting warmer and drier throughout the weekend. (But) feeling real confident that we are ahead of the curve on that,” he said.Bruno Rodriguez, an inter-agency meteorologist assigned to the fire, said gusts should continue to increase by about 5 mph (8 kph) per day, from 25 mph (40 kph) Thursday to as strong as 50 mph (80 kph) by Monday.“It’s definitely going to be a critical fire weather pattern and unfortunately it’s going to be fairly prolonged and persistent,” he said.__Associated Press writer Scott Sonner contributed to this report from Reno, Nevada."}, {"title": "California Considers Banning Declawing Of Cats In Most Cases", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans, advancing a bill on Thursday to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin.Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws.Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems.The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes necessary “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.”The bill that passed the state Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The bill specifically bans declawing “for a cosmetic or aesthetic purpose or to make the cat more convenient to keep or handle.”The California Veterinary Medical Association says that ignores situations where cat owners are “taking blood thinners, receiving immunosuppression drugs, or other persons whose health would be endangered by a severe scratch.”In a letter to lawmakers, the association wrote that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”The bill now heads to the state Senate.New York was the first state to ban the procedure in 2019, followed by Maryland earlier this year. This is at least the fourth time California lawmakers have tried to ban declawing since 2018. All of the previous attempts failed.Eight California cities — including Los Angeles and San Francisco — ban declawing. In 2008, California lawmakers passed a law that would have stopped local governments from banning declawing. But the bill never became law because then Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it.Thursday, a majority of lawmakers in the California Assembly appeared eager to ban the procedure statewide. Democratic Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo, the author of the bill, quoted primatologist Jane Goodall in saying that “cruelty is the worst of human sins.”Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee talked about his cat, Soba, saying it would be “heartbreaking to know cats like her would be declawed.”“If a cat has essentially their finger bones taken out, their only defense becomes their teeth,” Lee said. “And having had many loving bites from my cat, I would rather be scratched than bitten by my own cat.”"}, {"title": "Chihuahua Puppy In Recovery After Being Shot Through The Neck With Arrow", "text": "A chihuahua puppy in Southern California has survived being shot through her neck with an arrow, after the projectile missed vital arteries.A woman called 911 on Monday saying she’d found the injured puppy in unincorporated Desert Hot Springs after hearing sounds of an animal “screaming,” according to a news release from Riverside County Animal Services.Animal services posted a jarring photo to social media that showed the puppy with the arrow still stuck in her neck. But her injuries weren’t as dire as they appeared.“It was purely a superficial wound,” Ivan Herrera, a veterinary technician who helped treat the puppy, told the Los Angeles Times.With the arrow now safely removed, the chihuahua’s good spirits have returned.“She’s lively, wagging her tail like a puppy and barking for our attention,” Herrera said.Veterinary staff and animal services workers are horrified at the possibility that someone may have shot the small dog on purpose.“She is such a sweet puppy,” veterinary technician Emily Ellison, who is helping with the dog’s treatment, said in the statement from animal services. “I cannot imagine why anyone would do something so terrible to such an innocent creature. It’s very sick.”Animal services is asking anyone with information about what happened to contact them.“For someone to willfully shoot this poor pup with an arrow is disgusting,” director Erin Gettis said in the department’s statement. “We are shocked and we hope someone can provide us any information as to who did this.”"}, {"title": "Bureau Of Land Management Employees Unionize In Wake Of Trump-Era Upheaval", "text": "Federal workers who help oversee hundreds of millions of acres of federal land have formed a union.Headquarters employees of the Bureau of Land Management voted 116 to 20 in favor of joining the National Treasury Employees Union in a ballot count held Wednesday, the union said. The new union would include roughly 200 workers based in Washington and regional offices around the country.Part of the Interior Department, BLM is responsible for managing roughly a third of all federal land, equal to about 10% of the U.S. landmass, the bulk of it in the West. A handful of the agency’s offices already have union representation, but the headquarters group is the largest to unionize to date. The union will include workers who manage BLM programs and budgets, as well as administrative staff.Zoe Davidson, a BLM employee who helped organize the union, said the agency’s employees generally love their jobs, but want a stronger voice when it comes to dealing with Congress and agency leadership. BLM has been understaffed for years, though President Joe Biden has proposed increasing funding so the agency can hire more and fill open roles.“A union really gives you that voice on Capitol Hill,” said Davidson, a botanist based in New Mexico. “Congress puts a lot of pressure on us. We always get these congressional requests… but they never give us a boost in the budget or in permanent employees to do this stuff.”Workers are also hoping to get more job security and prevent any big unilateral changes from leadership.BLM employees were jostled around under the Trump administration, which sought to disperse employees from the D.C. headquarters to western offices, on the grounds that they should be closer to the majority of public lands. Most employees were reluctant to uproot their lives, and the relocation led to nearly 300 people ― the vast majority of affected workers ― resigning or taking early retirement. (Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney suggested attrition was the real goal.)Biden’s interior secretary, Deb Haaland, said in September that the agency will restore its Washington headquarters while keeping many workers at a “Western headquarters” in Grand Junction, Colorado. Davidson said many headquarters employees were recently hired and are scattered in offices in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City and elsewhere, and they may not want to move, either.Discussion of unionization preceded all the relocation upheaval, but the episode made clear to many workers that they want a seat at the table with agency leaders, according to Davidson. Workers at her New Mexico BLM office voted to unionize last year with NTEU, which led headquarters employees to reach out to her and her coworkers.Federal workers are eligible to form unions, though they don’t have all the same rights as their private-sector counterparts. They cannot bargain directly over pay or go on strike, but their unions can have a say in the promotion process, scheduling and discipline, and make it harder for agency leadership to make major change without consultation.The Biden White House has promoted collective bargaining as a means for workers to improve their jobs, including those in the federal government. The administration has unwound some of Trump’s attacks on unions in the federal sector, and taken a more diplomatic approach to bargaining.“We’re under a very pro-union administration,” Davidson said. “We have tons of interest coming at us.... We would love to build more unions in the Bureau of Land Management.”Tony Reardon, NTEU’s president, compared the BLM unionization effort to recent successes at employers like Starbucks and Amazon, where workers recently notched historic labor victories.“It should be no surprise that as the labor movement makes new inroads in the private sector, the same would be true for the federal sector, because workers everywhere share the same goal: to be treated with dignity and respect,” Reardon, whose union represents 150,000 workers in 34 federal agencies, said in a statement.BLM employs around 9,000 workers around the country ― roughly 95% of them outside Washington ― but there are an estimated 2,000 vacancies at the agency thanks in part to past federal hiring freezes. Public land advocates say the agency is chronically underfunded and poorly equipped to carry out its mission.A Government Accountability Office report last year said many headquarters positions have been open since 2016, and workers have been pulled off their normal jobs to help fill those duties. Vacancies increased after the Trump administration announced the headquarters move.“We saw what happened without a union,” Davidson said. “We’ll see what a union can do moving forward.”Correction: This story originally misstated the election vote count. The union won 116-20, not 136-20."}, {"title": "NOAA Predicts Another Busy Atlantic Hurricane Season", "text": "Federal meteorologists are forecasting a record-shattering seventh straight unusually busy Atlantic hurricane season.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted Tuesday that the summer in the Atlantic will produce 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to six turbo-charging into major hurricanes with winds greater than 110 mph. Even with normals shifting upwards to reflect more active storm seasons in recent decades, these predictions are above the 30-year average of 14 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.The National Hurricane Center ran out of names for Atlantic storms in the last two years, with a record-setting 30 named storms in 2020 and 21 last year. In the past five years there have been more Category 4 and 5 hurricane landfalls in the United States than in the previous 50 years combined.This hurricane season “is going to be similar to last year and given that you need only one bad storm to dramatically affect your life, if you fail to plan around this outlook, you’re planning to fail,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad told The Associated Press Tuesday. “You can take this outlook to the bank literally when it looks to protecting your property.”Every weather factor pointed to a busier season, said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster for NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. He pointed to a multi-decade long trend to more storms in the Atlantic, an active monsoon season in West Africa, a La Nina — the natural and occasional cooling of parts of the equatorial Pacific that changes weather worldwide — and warmer than normal ocean temperatures, which scientists say are stoked by climate change.Several outside hurricane experts agree with NOAA that the Atlantic conditions are ripe for yet another active hurricane season. They say La Nina reduces wind shear that could decapitate storms. The warmer water — about half a degree warmer (0.3 degrees Celsius) than last year in storm-forming areas, according to Rosencrans — serves as hurricane fuel. A reduction in pollution particles in the air has taken away artificial cooling in the Atlantic and a new study links that to increasing storms.Last week President Joe Biden also warned the nation about “another tough hurricane season” coming.“We’re seeing these storms happen more frequently. They’re lasting longer,” FEMA Director Deanne Criswell said in a New York City press conference. NOAA says 13 people in the city died during Hurricane Ida with 11 of them dying in flooded basements. It is also the 10th anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, a downgraded hurricane that became one of the most expensive weather disasters in American history with massive flooding in New York.“We’ve seen such a dramatic change in the type of weather events that could be seen as a result of climate change,” Criswell said.NOAA said there’s a 65% chance for an “above-normal” hurricane season, a 25% chance for a normal season and only a one in 10 chance for an unusually quiet season.One key indicator, that takes into account the number of storms, how strong they are and how long they last, is called Accumulated Cyclone Energy index or ACE and Rosencrans said this year could be as much as double what’s been normal since 1950. The calculation is used when determining what is an average season and what’s above average.The average ACE since 1950 is just shy of 100, while the last six years have ranged from 132 to 225 in 2017.That stretch of six straight above-average years is a record, smashing the old mark of three-in-a-row, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher and seasonal forecaster Phil Klotzbach. He said it is highly likely that the record will stretch to seven this year.“It’s really a strange thing that we’ve had six consecutive seasons be so active,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.NOAA’s predictions mesh with ten other meteorological teams — government, university and private — that have made their hurricane season predictions. The average of their predictions is 20 named storms, eight becoming hurricanes and four becoming major hurricanes.Because La Nina has a different effect in the Pacific and conditions usually are opposite, earlier this month NOAA predicted a quieter than normal Pacific storm season.Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

The nonprofit added that “the person who found them told us that he’s been taking care of babies, and we think this is about the cutest thing ever.”The person who spotted the four felines outside first waited to see if a mother cat showed up.

But all four kittens are “doing great so far,” Fugate said, and are in the care of a foster home, where the youngest ones are being bottle-fed every few hours.

A New Bill May Make Going Electric The Easy Choice.", "text": "When it’s cold outside, most American homes burn gas or fuel for warmth ― a big part of why buildings are the country’s fourth-largest source of climate-changing emissions. When it’s hot, an even bigger percentage of households switch on electric air conditioners.Heat pumps ― essentially two-way air conditioners ― can do both, warming homes without spewing fossil fuel pollution into the air. But buying and installing these machines generally costs more than air conditioners, government incentives to offset prices vary by state and many people simply haven’t heard of a heat pump.A new bill set to be announced in the Senate this week aims make heat pumps more popular by boosting domestic production, giving manufacturers tax credits of between $600 and $1,000 per machine.While far more limited than policies in some European countries, the proposed federal handout is meant to drive down prices in line with home cooling systems and spurring companies to market and sell more of the appliances in lieu of traditional air conditioners. If heat pumps become the standard cooling appliances in a country where 66% of households have central air conditioning, then why double up on heating by installing a fossil-fueled furnace or boiler, too?“This legislation is a win-win ― reducing energy costs for consumers, while strengthening access to clean, energy-efficient heating solutions,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the bill’s lead author, said in a statement.Heat pumps transfer rather than generate heat. While an air conditioner absorbs heat from inside the building and moves it outside, a heat pump absorbs heat from outside and moves it inside. This works by circulating a refrigerant through an evaporator and condenser.For every 1 kilowatt hour of electricity a heat pump uses, it produces 2 to 4 kilowatt hours of heat energy, making it up to four times more efficient than a regular boiler or furnace, according to Carbon Switch, a service that provides detailed guides on climate-friendly appliances. The Department of Energy found that heat pumps use roughly half as much power as traditional electric systems like space heaters or baseboard heaters.“There’s very little difference from a hardware perspective between a one-way air conditioner and a two-way heat pump,” said Kevin Kircher, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who researches heat pumps.The bill, he said, is calibrated to make up the difference in hardware costs on the assembly line, making it cheaper to just manufacture two-way heat pumps instead of air conditioners.“The big picture is that heat pumps today, in a lot of markets, are substantially more expensive than a gas furnace,” Kircher said. “This isn’t so much to make heat pumps cheaper than incumbent options but to make heat pumps more prevalent.”But the efficiency of electric heating makes it less sensitive on average to price spikes from shocks in the fossil fuel markets even though most of the U.S. grid is still powered with gas and coal. A study last fall by the federal Energy Information Administration found that U.S. households heating primarily with natural gas would spend at least 30% more than the last winter’s average. Homes with oil heating were on track to spend at least 43% more. Propane users faced a 54% spike.By contrast, households heating primarily with electricity were looking at a 6% cost increase last winter.Once the U.S. generates the vast majority of its electricity from non-fossil sources, heating prices would be even steadier.Heat pumps aren’t a perfect climate fix. While undoubtedly less damaging than burning gas or oil, the refrigerants used in heat pumps and air conditioners are potent greenhouse gases when leaked into their atmosphere. New international standards agreed to last month will set the stage for more climate-friendly chemicals, but the U.S. could be slow to adopt the cleanest coolants.Some 12 million U.S. households already use heat pumps. The appliances are primarily deployed in the South, where nearly one-fifth of homes have heat pumps, and out West. Those regions tend to be hotter and saw the biggest increase in new housing construction over the past decade, making new technologies that provide both cooling and heat a more obvious choice.Heat pumps have historically tended to be less efficient in extreme cold, when there’s just less warm air to pull from outside. But the technology has improved significantly over the past decade.Colder states in the Northeast, which still relies heavily on oil for heating, are now seeing a double-digit rate of growth in heat pump adoption, compared to single-digit rises in the West, South and Midwest, according to a report from the Atlas Building Hub. State-level subsidies are helping. Massachusetts offers rebates of up to $10,000 off heat pump systems. New York’s rebates can top $7,500. Maine’s are up to $1,200.Klobuchar’s bill marks a first step toward making heat pumps more of a national priority, said Parth Vaishnav, an assistant professor of sustainable systems at the University of Michigan, who called it “a start, a carrot.”“But to really drive a transformation you need the carrot and the stick,” he said.Since Berkeley, California, became the first U.S. city to prohibit new gas hookups, dozens have followed, with New York City becoming the largest to pass a ban last winter. No state has yet banned gas, though New York recently considered following its eponymous city. But nearly two dozen states, primarily led by Republicans, have passed laws barring cities from banning gas.Europe offers a stark comparison. The Swiss city of Zurich voted to ban gas heating in November and eliminate the need for households to pick a single source by instead building a municipally-owned district heating system that would distribute warmth from a central location much like electricity is transmitted from a power plant. That model for heating is already popular in cold Nordic nations.The United Kingdom is moving ahead with a ban on gas boilers, at least in England, and offering grants to households totaling nearly $6,300. Germany set a rule requiring all new heating systems installed after 2025 to run primarily on renewable energy. This month, the Netherlands ― once Europe’s top gas producer ― announced plans to ban new gas-only heating by 2026 and make heat pumps mandatory in most buildings.Such mandates would be challenging to enact in the U.S., where an entrenched fossil fuel industry and a federalized system of government have made overhauling energy use difficult.Building codes here are set at the state level but follow a generic set of measures drafted and updated every three years by the International Code Council, a nonprofit consortium of industry groups and state and city government officials. While governments have in recent years pushed for codes that mandate more electrification of new buildings, industry groups ― including trade associations of gas utilities ― have fought back. Last year, those groups succeeded in curbing the power governments have over what makes it into the final set of generic U.S. building codes.Legislation outright banning gas or oil would also be unlikely to pass in the U.S. Senate, where most Republicans and a number of prominent Democrats remain staunchly opposed to policies that explicitly shut out fossil fuel businesses.Klobuchar’s legislation has six Democrats signed on ― Sens. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). The bill includes provisions supporting organized labor, promising to increase applicable tax credits by 10% for heat pumps made in unionized factories.If more conservative lawmakers like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) approved, the bill could be passed as part of a reconciliation bill, a Senate process that allows Democrats to use their narrow 50-vote majority to enact law.But tax credits for companies producing clean-energy products have generally been popular with both Democrats and Republicans, meaning the legislation could ultimately pass through traditional means with some kind of bipartisan majority. The Senate voted 86-11 to pass a $40 million aid package to help Ukraine fight Russia with U.S. weapons.As Europeans scrambling to replace Russian gas supplies, the U.S. is angling to sell the continent more liquefied natural gas. The new Senate bill proposes another option.“To cut emissions, we need to green home heating. To squeeze Putin, we need Europeans to stop using Russian natural gas,” Hickenlooper said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “By spurring U.S. heat pump manufacturing we can lower emissions, cut European dependence on Russia and create jobs at home.”CORRECTION: This story has been amended to account for an error in Klobuchar’s press release that attributed Hickenlooper’s quote to her."}, {"title": "News Leak: Dolphins Recognize Each Other By Tasting One Another's Urine", "text": "It’s a whiz of a discovery: Dolphins recognize one another by the taste of their urine.New research suggests that the ocean mammals have a unique sense of taste that allows them to sense friends and family members through pee and other excretions.According to the study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers had a singular porpoise, er, purpose: to see how the sea creatures reacted to urine samples from different individuals.Turns out, dolphins were more likely to show interest in urine collected from animals they knew rather than randos.“Dolphins explored urine samples for longer if they came from known animals or when they were presented together with the dolphin’s unique and distinctive signature whistle, an acoustic identifier that works like a name,” professor Vincent Janik, director of the Scottish Oceans Institute and lead author of the study, told the Guardian.Researchers employed the services of bottlenose dolphins who swim with tourists at the Dolphin Quest resorts in Hawaii and Bermuda.Fellow researcher Jason Bruck, a marine biologist at Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas, told National Geographic the original goal was to test whether dolphins use their signature whistles in the same way people rely on names.Bruck couldn’t do that unless he found a second way dolphins could identify each other. Luckily, he remembered that a fellow scientist had previously observed wild dolphins swimming through what the website called “plumes of urine” and he figured the creatures might be using it as an ID technique.“It was a shot in the dark,” Bruck said. “And I was not expecting it to work, to be honest.”But it did.Dolphins don’t have a sense of smell, so the way they would identify each other went like this: When one dolphin peed or pooped, the others would swim through the excretions with their mouths to get a big taste of their friend, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Company.“In other animals, it’s very difficult to separate the sense of smell from the sense of taste. So this is a really exciting opportunity to just study how taste works in this really unique way,” Bruck told the network.The researchers noticed the participating dolphins spent three times longer analyzing urine they recognized than pee from strangers.Bruck also noticed the dolphins seemed to be as fascinated with the experiment as he was.“The dolphins were very, very keen to participate,” Bruck told National Geographic. “Usually, dolphins get bored with my experiments. We were tapping into something that is part of the dolphins’ world.”"}, {"title": "The Lithium War Next Door", "text": "This story was published in collaboration with The Assembly, a digital magazine about the people, institutions and ideas that shape North Carolina.GASTON COUNTY, North Carolina — Brian Harper opened the door to his back porch, stepped outside, and inhaled the brisk air. Exhaling, he stretched his arms out wide as if to embrace the bucolic scene before him.Moments like this were sacred — and, he feared, fleeting.On that late afternoon in early January, the sun cast a golden tint over the brown frost-nipped fields behind the Harper family’s stately brick home. Just a few hundred feet away was the red barn containing his workshop, where he makes precision gears for clients like Duracell, Dart Container Corp. and Nestlé.Harper, 54, wanted to catch the last bit of light on his quiet stretch of farmland about 45 minutes northwest of Charlotte. He crunched onto his icy lawn and cut a diagonal path across his neatly mowed 12 acres. Past the neighboring home where his sister-in-law and her family live and down a gentle slope, he came to a stop on the squishy banks of a brook. He crouched down and pointed to a small mound of mud — a crayfish burrow. Before long, Harper said, a herd of deer would make its nightly visit to drink and munch on greenery the recent cold snap hadn’t yet claimed.“This, to me, is paradise,” Harper said. “And all this, when they start mining, will disappear.”Beneath these rolling hills lies what many investors now call “white gold.” And just beyond Harper’s tree line, the mining startup Piedmont Lithium wants to dig up to four 500-foot-deep pits to pull out the lithium reserves that once made Gaston County the world’s top source of the soft metal now used to make batteries for cellphones and electric vehicles. If permits and local zoning changes clear the way for the project, Piedmont could begin digging as early as next year, making this likely the first major new supply of American lithium since demand started surging over the past two years.The mine has become an unlikely microcosm of a clean-energy conflict starting to take center stage in the debate over how to avert catastrophic global warming. To preserve a planet with hospitable weather patterns resembling what we see today, the world needs to rapidly phase out oil, gas and coal. But quitting fossil fuels means dramatically increasing the supply of minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt that make it possible to do with electricity what today requires igniting liquid carbon. And in places from Chile to Serbia, Nevada to now North Carolina, the clashes erupting between mining companies and the people who live near resource deposits are increasingly known as “lithium wars” and could dictate how that transition happens.Few places in the U.S. better exemplify the demand for battery metals than the American South, where the power grid is especially dirty, the lack of public transit makes personal automobiles necessary, and labor laws that are unfavorable to unions have helped attract car factories.Last December, Toyota unveiled plans for a $1.3 billion battery plant in Greensboro, North Carolina. In March, Vietnamese electric-car maker VinFast announced it would build its first U.S. plant in North Carolina. This week, Hyundai confirmed Savannah, Georgia, as the site of its next big electric vehicle factory. The South Korean battery behemoth SK Innovation was already building its manufacturing hub in northern Georgia to supply lithium packs to the Tennessee factories building Ford’s electric F-150 and Volkswagen’s signature crossover models.Beneath the soybean fields, pine stands and trickling streams of this county is a uniquely pure vein of minerals containing the most valued type of lithium on the market today. The price of the metal overall surged nearly 500% between 2021 and 2022, with forecasts showing demand is set to increase fourfold by the end of the decade. Lithium hydroxide, the type of finished product Piedmont would sell, sold in mid-May for as much as $72,000 per metric ton — a 127% increase since the start of the year.But as the Biden administration and lawmakers from both parties push to ramp up domestic mining and processing in hopes of breaking China’s near-monopoly on the metal, local opposition is mounting. In Nevada, Native American tribes, ranchers and environmentalists complain that a big proposed lithium mine in the desert threatens to desecrate sacred land, deplete a drought-dried water table, and kill off rare plant species. In California, plans to extract lithium from the inland Salton Sea have stoked concerns over air pollution and toxic contaminants. Projects to mine copper, nickel and rare earth minerals — all critical ingredients to a post-fossil future — have faced similar complaints across Western states.With the roughly 3,200 acres of land it now controls, Piedmont vowed to make this county — which in the 1950s was the epicenter of global lithium production — the home of “the world’s most sustainable lithium project.” The company is spending millions on infrastructure and equipment that it said will set a new standard for reducing air pollution and noise from a mine of any kind. It has pledged to treat and recycle water, help neighbors whose water wells run dry as a result of the mining, and pay local employees salaries about 50% higher than the county average.“You couldn’t possibly design our project in a more environmentally friendly way — our team is smart, experienced and cognizant of what the rules are,” said Keith Phillips, 62, Piedmont’s chief executive and a former mining banker on Wall Street. “We think it’s the best lithium asset on the planet, and we think the community should be inordinately proud of it.”But that sales pitch is falling flat with many residents here, who fear the mine dooms a community with families who trace their roots back centuries. Unlike projects out West, which are largely located on sparsely populated tracts owned by the state or federal governments, Gaston County has more than 610 people per square mile — nearly seven times the average U.S. population density. There’s no municipal water supply, and the mine will draw millions of gallons from the same water table that replenishes local wells and streams. Residents here worry about pollution: Small-scale mining from decades ago left behind toxic waste. And in a county close to one of the nation’s fastest-growing financial capitals, property owners wince at how much value their land could lose if there’s a mine practically in their backyard.Piedmont, by its own admission, has been slow to reach out to the community, many of whose members now see the company’s executives as opportunistic carpetbaggers. In a place where children bear surnames etched on gravestones older than the United States itself, many residents worry the horizon for any benefits from the project is short. If mining lasts only 30 years, as company statements have suggested, or alternative battery chemistries make lithium-ion packs obsolete, they fear their sacrifices will have only enriched Piedmont’s shareholders.Now a coalition of those neighbors wants to stop the project in its tracks. For months now, signs calling for Piedmont to leave have fluttered up and down the country roads that crisscross the county. Fearing state and federal mining rules are stacked in favor of permitting the project, these locals have focused on what they see as the most vulnerable chokepoint: persuading the Gaston County Board of Commissioners to reject Piedmont’s bid to rezone the area from agricultural to industrial use. At public hearings so far, these opponents of the mine outnumbered supporters.Both sides of the feud see it as an existential fight. If wells dry up, if contaminants make it less safe to live here, or if the wildlife and landscapes that define the area disappear, many lament the possibility of becoming the final generation of their families to call this place home. But others worry that if a state-of-the-art mine can’t move forward in a place with a history of lithium production at a time when political and market demand is this high, then the chances of seriously slashing fossil fuel use in the world’s largest economy look slim.“Right now, the battery plants that are there in the U.S. are dependent on imports,” said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at the British-based battery supply chain research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “Having a domestic, secure supply of lithium is critical. And obviously Piedmont is one of those projects.”Long before there was a Gaston County or a United States — hundreds of millions of years ago — the tectonic plates beneath northern Africa and North America collided, forming the Appalachian Mountains. Molten magma oozed into cracks in the Earth’s crust and formed veins of igneous rock geologists call pegmatite containing a mineral named spodumene, the ore that is processed into lithium.The deposit, known as the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt, is one of the oldest and most economically important formations of its kind in North America. The belt is roughly 25 miles long, snaking northeast from the South Carolina border to Lincolnton, North Carolina. The thickest portion, barely 2 miles wide, is in Gaston County, where outcroppings of the yellowish, flaky mineral are abundant enough that you can pluck samples from boulders in the woods.It’s hard to tell from today’s quiet, rural landscape, but this area was the cradle of the lithium industry throughout the mid-20th century. Small mines along the belt supplied most of the world’s lithium, then primarily used for pharmaceuticals and, later, in nuclear weapons. Demand for the commodity grew quickly after World War II as industry and Cold War arms makers alike increased their appetites. Some mom-and-pop miners even dug trenches in their backyards and sold ore to the federal government. In 1939, the value of lithium mined in the U.S. came out to a little over $500,000 annually, according to inflation-adjusted data from a 1955 U.S. Geological Survey report. By 1953, that output was worth more than $21 million.The next two decades were the heyday of Gaston County’s lithium boom. And it was, quite literally, a boom. Back in the 1970s, when miners set off dynamite to break up rocks at the now-defunct Hallman-Beam lithium mine in Bessemer City, the windows would rattle in Dean Crocker’s home.“Those blasts could be heard for miles and miles,” said Crocker, now in his 80s, a cattle farmer whose family has lived in Gaston County for seven generations.At peak capacity, Piedmont could set off multiple explosions per day as it mines deeper into the ground. That might be an irritation for Crocker and others. But Harper, who runs Stine Gear & Machine Co. from his barn, said even a single routine blast would make it impossible for him to run his business, which relies on highly sensitive machines calibrated to carve precise grooves into metal cogs.The number of explosions will depend on where the miners are in the ore body, Phillips said, noting that local ordinances would bar Piedmont from blasting “when it’s dark, weekends or holidays.” He insisted the company has every incentive to blast as little as possible because it’s a difficult and time-consuming process.“Ideally you blast just enough so the team can move it from the processing area,” the chief executive said. “The fewer times you blast, the better off everybody is.”Harper said he met with Piedmont representatives and told them it would cost about $250,000 to move all his equipment to a new location, and asked what they could offer him to help. The company never responded, he said.“That’s completely inaccurate,” Phillips said. “To be crystal clear: A man with a machine shop who needs a quarter-million dollars, do you think we’re going to let him stand in the way? If he needs a quarter-million dollars, we’ll find him a quarter-million dollars. That’s the world’s easiest answer. But we want to really understand it. We’re actually not convinced it’s true that anything we do will have any impact on what he’s doing.”The lithium industry’s legacy in the region is one of the stronger arguments in favor of starting a new chapter. After all, it never fully went away. In the 1980s, the Hallman-Beam and other mines closed down as lithium production shifted overseas, where more lax rules made it cheaper to extract. Australia became a top producer, particularly of lithium extracted via hard-rock mining. South America — Chile and Argentina, in particular — emerged as major sources of lithium produced by a process known as brining, where miners flood pools of water in the desert and collect the metals that remain after evaporation.Little by little, China came to dominate the supply chain: By 2020, it became a top-four supplier of raw materials, the No. 1 refiner of processed lithium, the No. 1 manufacturer of lithium batteries and components, and the No. 1 market demanding more lithium, according to a ranking from the energy consultancy BloombergNEF. In 2021, a newer version of BloombergNEF’s report that laid out its findings in slightly different categories ranked China No. 1 in battery raw materials, manufacturing and demand.The U.S., by contrast, ranked 15th in lithium production in 2020, despite coming in second for market demand, and came in 11th last year for raw materials. That the U.S. placed in the top 20 at all owes on some level to the legacy industry that remains here in North Carolina’s Piedmont region.Albemarle Corp., one of the largest lithium mining companies in the world, is still headquartered in Charlotte. In March, the firm began holding public meetings about restarting production at a shuttered lithium mine in Kings Mountain, just south of Gaston County.Livent Corp., the modern spinoff of the mining company that once owned the Hallman-Beam mine, still operates a lithium refining business in Bessemer City, where in 2019 it said it would spend $18 million to increase its output of the metal.A spokesman for Livent said the company stopped all hard-rock mining in North Carolina in 1996 and sold Hallman-Beam in 1998. Today the site is located next to a quarry owned by Martin Marietta Materials. A spokeswoman for the Raleigh-based building materials seller did not respond to multiple requests for comment.One scar the mine left behind was an artificial pond so polluted with arsenic that two neighbors separately relayed stories of watching birds land there only to die shortly afterward. Arsenic occurs naturally along the spodumene belt, and state regulators have long considered Gaston County a “hot spot” for contamination. Chronic exposure to arsenic causes diarrhea and stomach cramping in the short term and increases the risk of cancer over time. While I could not find any studies or reports that independently verified locals’ claims about avian deaths, federal studies have documented the deadly effect arsenic has on animals, and examples abound of migratory birds dying after landing in arsenic-contaminated ponds.The Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation, a local environmental group focused on the region’s water systems, said modern mining techniques generally produce fewer tailings, or leftover materials, than in the 1950s, so the risk of similar arsenic contamination from Piedmont’s project is lower.But the county’s natural waterways could suffer, the nonprofit said. Last November, the Catawba Riverkeeper joined researchers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in conducting a survey of the area that discovered two new species of crayfish.The researchers asked Piedmont for permission to survey some of the land the company owns. The firm had no legal obligation to comply and declined, said Brandon Jones, the Riverkeeper’s chief scientist. (Phillips said he did not recall that conversation.)“There’s actually much more diversity and we’re just starting to tell the different crayfish apart,” Jones said. “We’re certainly concerned about losing some of those species.”Stirring up arsenic is the least of many residents’ worries. Most of the ore Piedmont plans to dig is below the water table, meaning as the company excavates, water will flood in and it will need to be pumped out. The firm said in regulatory filings that it would pull between 860,000 gallons and 1.1 million gallons of water from the ground per day at peak capacity.“This is certainly going to be dropping the water table, and it will certainly be impacting wells,” Jones said.Piedmont acknowledged in filings that its mining may lower the water table, which is uniquely close to the surface. Abundant streams like the one on Harper’s property are one visible effect of that geological reality. Another unseen one is how shallow some residents here have dug their wells. Some household wells, one resident said, go down only 30 feet. More common, though, are wells dug 300 feet deep.“We don’t think we’re going to impact anybody directly,” Phillips said. “If we do, we’ll be happy to remediate it.”In a state permit application, Piedmont suggested that it would drill new wells for homeowners at its own discretion if its experts determined that mining operations were responsible for a well going dry.As a secondary solution, the company said it would pay to connect homeowners to a municipal water source. That could prove tricky, since the area around the proposed mine is not currently piped for that, and the nearest municipal supply has, in the past, struggled to service its existing customer base in times of drought. It may not be a popular option, either: Households on wells do not pay for water, and the company said in the application that it would not pay people’s water bills once they’re hooked up to a municipal supply.Piedmont said it “may also” supply neighbors who lose their wells with water tanks and short-term deliveries that “meet the minimum water volume used or needed by the resident prior to the groundwater level decline.” If all else fails, the company said it will “negotiate in good faith” to buy the property.“We know that there’s different depths of where some of the aquifers are. Everybody thinks you drill a hole in the ground, and there’s one big lake under here. It’s not like that,” David Klanecky, then Piedmont’s chief operating officer, told me during an hourlong drive around Gaston County in January. “There are all these different pockets. We’ve done all these different water studies with hydrogeologists out here. There may be some impacts.”(Klanecky and another executive who gave me a tour around Piedmont’s properties, vice president of corporate communications Brian Risinger, have since left the company. Phillips said Klanecky took a job as chief executive of a battery recycling firm, but remains a “technical adviser and close friend” of Piedmont. He said Risinger “left on his own accord.”)Piedmont’s opponents, Klanecky said, think “we’re going to drain all the water in Gaston County and this is going to be a desert in five years. That’s probably not going to happen, right? So, we can talk through this with people.”“The truth is, nobody knows how it will affect our water system,” said Bob Lancaster, 71, a retiree who relies on well water and lives just north of the county. “But once you ring the bell, you can’t unring it.”On a cold night in January, I met Dan Setzer, 58, at his tidy one-story home near the proposed mine. While we discussed the possibility of relying on bottled water, he hurried to the kitchen sink to fill me a glass. It tasted crisp and mineraly, distinct from the highly treated but prized tap water in New York City, where I’m from.“We’ve got springs and creeks that are some of the nicest around,” the upholstery manufacturing worker said. He just didn’t believe Piedmont’s promises to ultimately restore whatever land it tarnishes with its operation. “They’ll never put that back. … This is just a money grab to them.”Locke Bell, a retired former district attorney who lives with his wife on a sprawling property dense with woodlands and gardens, suspected the company didn’t even have a full picture of which wells its project would affect. He has three operating wells on his land. A map Piedmont submitted in public documents last year showed just one, he said.“I’ve got four creeks, too, and three of them will be dry if they mine,” Bell said, puffing on a cigar on his back porch. “Everybody else, and all the wildlife that lives off these things, it’ll all be gone.”The Catawba Riverkeeper also worries about runoff pollution in the surface streams. Right now, Piedmont is proposing 30-foot setbacks — or undisturbed buffer zones between the mine and streams, which is the requirement under North Carolina law.“We’d prefer 100-foot setbacks,” Jones said. “That’s the gold standard for the industry.”The company would, in fact, have a “different setback for different things,” Phillips said, adding that for “our pits, we’re expecting [the setback] to be 100 feet.”Piedmont Lithium got its start six years ago, when Taso Arima, an Australian investor who works on mining startups, joined forces with Lamont Leatherman, a geologist who grew up in Lincolnton, near the end of the Tin-Spodumene Belt. Canadian-born Phillips, who previously worked at JPMorgan Chase, joined a year later.In September 2016, the company secured the rights to buy at least five separate tracts of land in Gaston County, according to property records. By the end of 2017, it added at least nine more and registered at least one separate shell company to make land deals in North Carolina.At first, the company planned to mine in Gaston County but build its chemical processing plant near Kings Mountain, just south of the area. But the firm ultimately acquired land adjacent to its mining tracts that it deemed suitable for the facility, and changed its plans to consolidate everything in one area.Piedmont inked its first major deal in September 2020, to supply electric auto giant Tesla with one-third of the mine’s annual output of unprocessed spodumene for five years. Last year, Piedmont, which had until then been headquartered in Australia, officially “redomiciled” in Belmont, North Carolina, roughly 30 minutes away from the proposed mine, on the opposite side of Gaston County. It also currently occupies a small field office closer to the site.As of last October, the company controlled approximately 3,245 acres, of which 1,526 acres were claims on private property through option or deferred purchase agreements, 113 acres were under long-term mineral leasing deals, 79 acres were under lease-to-own contracts, and 1,527 acres were owned by Piedmont outright, according to figures in a feasibility study it published. That, the firm said, is more than enough to begin its work, though it claims on its website to be “actively and aggressively adding further options to considerably expand our presence in the region.”“We want to continue to acquire property here, because we think there’s more development opportunity,” Klanecky said. “Realistically, this could be double the size of what we’ve announced today if we continue to acquire more land. We know there’s spodumene on the belt, and we know there’s lithium.”The main obstacle, he said, were landowners who refused to sell their property, or asked the company to pay 10 times what the firm believed the parcel was worth — which Piedmont considered exorbitant. Once the company has mining permits, Klanecky said, that will serve as a “trigger event” where holdouts will lose hope of stopping the mine and instead see the project as inevitable.“Once the state mining permits have been issued, that’ll be another trigger event. People will say, ‘They’re going to mine here, so let’s let them buy the property,’” Klanecky said. “We’re being patient. We’ve done a lot of really good deals with owners. I think we’ve paid them very well.”Asked if Piedmont’s generosity may be more limited if a landowner has a change of heart once mining begins, he said: “If it’s a relationship where it’s contentious, then they’ve got to understand the risk of not doing something. We try to point that out.”Perceptions of bad faith cut both ways. Crocker said he suspected Piedmont “thought Gaston County was an ignorant county, and they thought they could hoodwink us.” Harper said his first impression of the company was “gentlemen coming down from New York, thinking we were dumb hicks.”Even newer residents felt the company’s representatives had talked down to them. LeAnne Pembleton, a 64-year-old clinical health researcher who relocated here from Atlanta in 2015 with her husband, Rich, said: “My impression is they feel they’re dealing with a bunch of hillbillies. They acted so hoity-toity.”Klanecky conceded that “there’s some people who truly have an emotional connection,” not just property owners playing hardball.“Their grandfather grew up here. Their whole family lived here forever, and it’s hard to see their property sold or their neighbor’s property sold and be potentially impacted by that. That’s why we’re trying to minimize the impact to the people who can still live here,” Klanecky said. “Those are the hard conversations.”I asked Risinger, the spokesman at the time of my trip, if Piedmont could provide names or numbers for some of the 150 or so landowners who made deals to sell the company their property. He initially said yes, but did not respond to follow-up requests. At least half a dozen residents in Gaston County told me their neighbors had signed nondisclosure agreements with the firm. But what the firm called “trigger events,” Pembleton saw as bullying.“Some people feel they don’t have any choice,” she said at her dinner table one night. “A lot of them were snookered into signing the contracts.”If approved, the project would be a massive undertaking, dwarfing past mining and chemical operations in the county.The mining would start by digging a 500-foot-deep open pit. The miners will bore into the rock, load the holes with dynamite, and clear the area before blasting it apart. Workers would then sort through the remains and use machines to crush boulders into smaller rocks. Normally, at that point, a mining company would fill diesel trucks with excavated materials and drive them to a processing facility. But Piedmont plans to spend over $50 million on an electric-powered covered conveyor system that will snake thousands of feet from the dig site to the neighboring chemical plant. Another, smaller facility on the site will gather other rocks of value such as quartz and feldspar, which the company plans to sell for construction materials. Rocks and dirt without value will end up in a pile more than 21 stories high.At the chemical plant, the spodumene rocks will be roasted at lava-hot temperatures, cooled, crushed and cooked in sulfuric acid, which converts the spodumene from its alpha to beta form, a necessary prerequisite to refining it into lithium hydroxide. The mining operations and sorting plants will be powered completely with solar electricity, but the chemical plant will use natural gas.Despite the natural gas required — it’s difficult to reach the temperatures needed for processing without fossil fuels — Piedmont claims its lithium will be among the cheapest and cleanest in the world because of its local supply chain. Most lithium on today’s market is either mined similarly in Australia and then shipped to China for processing, or produced using the brining method in Chile and Argentina. Much of that, too, typically gets shipped to China for processing. The processed materials then go to battery manufacturers in China, Europe, South Korea or the U.S., where automakers are increasingly sourcing their electric vehicle components.“We think our project is, from an environmental perspective, going to be a world leader, located in an area where it can be closer to important customers, car companies and battery companies,” Phillips said.At some point in the next decade, Piedmont plans to dig a second pit, also as deep as the length of two football fields. Once it exhausts the first mine, it will dig a third and backfill the first, then repeat that process again with a fourth pit. Phillips declined to give a timeline for digging all four holes. The plan is to eventually leave the final pit open as a quarry.“You build one, mine one, then mine another and backfill the waste rock,” he said.Despite years of buying up properties and studying the mining potential of the area, Piedmont did not approach the Gaston County Board of Commissioners until April 2020. Phillips said mining projects take years to fully conceive, and a local adviser had told him to wait until the company had finalized its proposal to avoid any kind of confusion over Piedmont’s plans in the county.The firm only made its first public appearance at a hearing last July. It wasn’t exactly a warm welcome. Four of the seven commissioners expressed anger that this was the first time a company with such ambitious plans in the county was coming before the body that would ultimately decide its fate.Commission Chairman Chad Brown called the proposal “the worst rollout of a project from a company I’ve ever seen” in a Reuters interview before the hearing. From behind his wooden dais, he complained at the hearing that Piedmont’s marketing materials included the county government’s trademarked logo, giving the appearance that the officials had already rubber-stamped the proposal. When constituents asked about the proposed mine, Brown said he was made to look foolish because the company had not yet engaged with the commission.“I find it very damaging to me to have to tell these people that I don’t know anything about it,” Brown said. “It’s very frustrating.”During a portion in which constituents lined up to speak, Tim Hepler, a truck driver, said he tried selling his house, but had to take it off the market because no buyers wanted to be near a likely pit mine.“Houses are selling for $30 to $50 less per square foot that are going to be near what a lot of people are saying is the big hole in the ground that’s proposed, and near a chemical plant,” he said. “The Piedmont Lithium people, are they going to live near this big hole in the ground and near this chemical plant? That’s a real big question that needs to be asked of them.”Harper warned that the project would destroy his livelihood.“What is happening here may make other people’s dreams,” he said, his voice quivering with emotion. “But mine is going away.”A handful of residents expressed support for the proposal. Kevin Gee said he recently moved to the area and urged a farming community concerned over pollution to take stock of how much pesticide and chemical fertilizer was already used here.“Change is abrasive. It’s hard. I get it … [but] any objection anyone has to this project I can overcome in five minutes,” he said. “I’m a dreamer, and I see the potential of a project like this, so I’m going to embrace it.”In response to the criticism, Phillips — dressed in a sleek, dark suit and fashionable clear-framed glasses — said at the hearing: “We haven’t spent a lot of time on community relations or government relations.”In August, Reuters reported that Piedmont indefinitely postponed its first shipments of spodumene ore to Tesla as it waited to get its permits in order, though in a public filing the company described the move as a “mutual agreement” to “extend” the “initial delivery dates.”“They might have put the cart before the horse a little bit with that deal,” said Gavin Montgomery, a battery raw materials analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Shortly afterward, shareholders filed two class action lawsuits accusing the company of giving investors and regulators a false picture of the project being ready to go and widely supported in the area. Lawyers representing the investors did not respond to repeated requests for comment.“We’re defending them vigorously and feel very strongly about our position,” Phillips said of the lawsuits.In the months that followed the public meeting, Piedmont seemed to hone its public messaging on jobs. The company promised to hire hundreds of workers — estimates in public statements have ranged from 300 to 500 — in a part of North Carolina that lost some furniture and textile manufacturing jobs to overseas competitors during late 20th century globalization. Salaries, the firm said, would top $80,000 per year in a county where the median annual income is a little over $53,000.But characterizations of Gaston County as some post-industrial husk seeking new economic lifeblood clash with what many here see as the potential next beneficiary of nearby Charlotte’s breakneck growth. The county’s unemployment rate in February was about 4%, in line with the national average. Gleaming new office parks line the highways that cut through the county, and in January construction was underway on several new buildings.Brown said virtually all the new corporate space is leased before construction is even complete.The businesses included a food-processing plant, a vehicle-lift manufacturer and an Amazon warehouse, which provided up to 40 jobs per acre of land the companies occupied, Brown said. By contrast, the Piedmont project offered one job per 6 acres.“Just because it’s jobs doesn’t mean it’s always the right fit,” Brown told me over breakfast at Cracker Barrel. “Some of the things they’ve rolled out are that we’re not doing very well economically. Well, I beg to differ.”Klanecky said Piedmont would create jobs for generations of workers in Gaston County, and not just in mining.“We think property values are going to increase once this operation is out here because you’re going to be attracting people making $90,000-plus a year,” he said. “They’re going to want to buy stuff.”At least one native has returned here to work at the mine. Piedmont hired Emily Blackburn, a 26-year-old geologist, to work on both community relations and resource exploration.“Piedmont Lithium brought me back home. I was in Minnesota after college,” Blackburn said. “Now I’m back at church with my parents. I moved back to my hometown. I got a fiancé.”She’s set to marry here in August.As the sun set over a field that would likely form the entrance to the mine, Eric Carpenter, 52, stood on his mother’s land and crossed his arms. The 5-acre parcel, once part of his grandfather’s cotton farm, is today filled with low, dense foliage and trees. The mine will “render our property worthless,” he said.Piedmont sent a representative to his 85-year-old mother’s home sometime between 2017 and 2018, he said, and proposed leasing the land. But Carpenter, who happened to be there when the employee showed up, asked to see a lease and run it by an attorney. The lease did not materialize, he said, and they never heard from the company again.In the meantime, Carpenter, an insurance underwriter, decided to research who would be liable for restoring the property after the mining was done. He found that the entire legal framework for approving projects like this in the state is the 1971 Mining Act, which caps the money state regulators can require a mine owner to set aside for cleanup and reclamation at $1 million.“This is really designed for a farmer who wants to sell sand from his property,” Carpenter said. “It doesn’t contemplate a mine of this size.”As things seemed to be moving forward last November, Carpenter said he spoke to L.T. McCrimmon, director of legislative affairs for Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. McCrimmon said the governor did not have the authority to issue an executive order halting mine permitting to give the legislature time to review and update the mining law. There didn’t seem to be much appetite in the legislature, anyway.That same month, Carpenter emailed his state legislators to ask about reviewing the law. State Sen. Kathy Harrington, who represents his district and is the Republican majority leader, never responded. State Rep. Kelly Hastings, a Republican, said the legislature had nothing to do with permitting the mine, and directed Carpenter to the governor, who oversees the regulatory agencies responsible for permitting mines. When Carpenter asked if Hastings would look into updating the law, he responded: “The General Assembly is not currently in session. Have a great Christmas.”By coincidence, the same week Carpenter started contacting his state leaders, an effort to reform a similarly outdated national mining law fell apart. On the federal level, the 1872 General Mining Law still governs hard-rock mining. Designed to encourage white settlement of the American West around the time of the California gold rush, the statute allows individuals or companies to stake claims on minerals found on public lands without paying royalties to the government. Mining companies have extracted some $300 billion worth of minerals from gold to lithium to copper from public lands since 1872, according to the environmental group Earthworks. And much like the North Carolina legislature, the U.S. Congress has been reluctant to update the law; last November, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) blocked a proposal to reform the 150-year-old legislation. A new bill from Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) is trying once again to add mining royalties and new protections, though critics have said it does little to require companies to seek input from communities near the projects.When Piedmont started buying property here, Klanecky said the county had no ordinances in place to regulate mining. Since then, he said, the county added some rules that the company supported. Those could help assuage some short-term concerns. But opponents of the project are thinking decades down the line, and remain skeptical of a technology that they do not see as a safe bet. What happens if an alternative battery chemistry seizes the market?In Australia, a company called Graphene Manufacturing Group claims its novel approach to making aluminum-ion battery cells could charge up to 70 times faster than lithium-ion batteries and hold three times as much energy as traditional aluminum-based cells. The company told Forbes it plans to roll out vehicle batteries in 2024.The Canadian startup Salient Energy says its zinc-ion batteries can compete directly with lithium-ion cells and offer a steadier domestic supply chain. But high energy costs and the war in Ukraine have sent prices soaring for a commodity that was already subject to market shocks similar to those that afflict lithium.Researchers in South Korea and a team from the U.S. and China recently made major breakthroughs with sodium-ion battery prototypes, though Arkady Krasheninnikov, a physicist studying the technology at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf laboratory, told the German broadcaster DW: “Our work is of a purely theoretical nature, and we do not claim that a new generation of batteries will be developed in the foreseeable future on the basis of our results.”Batteries built with vanadium are gaining attention as a potential competitor with lithium, particularly as prices of the latter metal continue to soar. In March, the Department of Energy issued a new category of license to help bring vanadium-based “flow” batteries to market. At an industry conference in May, James Hayter, an adviser at the natural resources investment fund Baker Steel Capital Managers, called vanadium “overlooked” and “more efficient than lithium-ion in the grid storage market,” according to a report from S&P Global Commodity Insights.But so-called flow batteries, which use external tanks of electrolyte fluids that pump through the device, will more likely “serve a part of the market that barely exists today for energy storage that can last for eight hours or more, while lithium-ion batteries will continue to be the leaders in shorter-duration storage, electric vehicles and consumer electronics,” a researcher from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado told Inside Climate News.Analysts say lithium demand is highly unlikely to drop off anytime soon — if anything, the rate of growth has exceeded projections. Piedmont, meanwhile, sees demand for the category of lithium it plans to produce soaring in the years to come. The high-nickel car-battery chemistry that yields longer range — a desirable trait in the U.S., where suburban sprawl means drivers face longer commute times than in other developed nations — tends to use more lithium hydroxide.Ideally, the U.S. could temper surging demand by increasing the availability of both public transit and recycling infrastructure to reuse existing lithium and other minerals, said Thea Riofrancos, an associate professor of political science at Providence College who co-authored a report on the U.S. battery supply chain for the nonprofit Climate and Community Project.“Our entire economic system is resource-intensive — but we live on a finite planet,” she said. “We could extract a lot less lithium, with fewer impacts on rural communities like those in Gaston County, if we took the opportunity of the energy transition to transform our transportation sector, building out mass transit and moving away from car dependency.”But Klanecky suggested some local opponents to the mine may have ideological blinders that make them less sensitive to the urgent realities of climate change.“This isn’t a place where you’re going to see something like the Bay Area, where everyone is going to convert to EVs because they think it’s good for the environment,” he said.Sixty-five percent of adults in Gaston County recognize that global warming is happening, 7 percentage points lower than the national average, according to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication’s 2021 survey. And 55% said local officials should do more to address climate change. But just 47% acknowledged that humans are causing climate change, while 37% said they believed warming was primarily due to natural cycles.That last claim was one Klanecky said he had heard before.“We want to listen to everybody and we want to educate everybody, but it’s hard to educate someone who thinks the Earth is tilted differently and that’s why it’s warmer or colder,” he said.Opponents of the project here say they aren’t numb to the climate concerns at all. Lancaster, the retiree, said he petitioned county officials to approve the big solar farm just down the block from his home. But in the face of ecological destruction on a scale few can reckon with, many here say they just want to preserve what they feel they have control over in their lives.“We have a high population here,” Pembleton said. “If things go wrong, responsibility will fall on the landowner to fight in court.”Phillips said it’s “not irrational” for the community to fear that “we’re some fly-by-night operation, and we’ll start this up and three weeks later we’ll run out of money and leave.” But, he said, “the good news is we’ve become a reasonably substantial company, we have investors like JPMorgan advising us. And we’ll have some very strong partners come into the project.”“We’re bending over backwards to be as accommodating as we can to a lot of people,” he said. “This is going to be a boom business. This is going to grow and grow and will be great for the community. I think people will look back and come to the realization that this worked out an awful lot better than they thought.”Harper doesn’t share that optimism. He had planned out his life. He would pass his business on to his 31-year-old daughter, who already works with him. He thought maybe, someday, his grandchildren would take over. And he would sit out on the porch in the afternoons watching his wife spend meditative hours listening to music on her headphones while she mowed the vast fields behind their home, and evenings observing the deer feast on the clippings.“This is God’s country. Each and every day we see turkey, deer, ringtail hawks, even a bald eagle that nests around here. This is a pristine, beautiful and tranquil area, and it’s going to be decimated,” Harper said. “All I can do is pray.”"}, {"title": "Pugs Can't Be Considered 'A Typical Dog' Due To Serious Health Issues, Study Says", "text": "A lot of people find pugs adorable, but there’s nothing cute about the serious health issues the dogs face.The small, flat-faced dogs are significantly more likely than non-pugs to suffer from a number of health problems, so much so that they “can no longer be considered a typical dog from a health perspective,” according to a new study from the United Kingdom’s Royal Veterinary College.The study, published this week in the journal Canine Medicine and Genetics, looked at clinical veterinary records of about 4,000 pugs and 22,000 non-pug dogs to determine the comparative odds of various canine health issues.Most significantly, pugs were found to have 54 times the odds of an average dog of having brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome, which refers to a series of problems that can affect brachycephalic ― meaning flat-faced ― dogs. The shorter bones in the dogs’ faces can lead to multiple issues that can cause breathing difficulties ranging from mild to severe.The researchers also found pugs to be at an increased risk of 23 other disorders, including skin fold infections, skin allergies and obesity.Researchers did also find that pugs were less likely to suffer from some problems, including heart murmurs and aggression. Overall, however, “disease predispositions were more common than disease protections,” researchers wrote, adding that pugs face “many critical health-related welfare challenges.”The study’s findings did not “come as a surprise” to veterinary surgeon Myfanwy Hill of the University of Cambridge, she told the BBC.Hill, who was not involved with the study, said pugs’ “brains are squished into a box that is too small” and that using their small nostrils is like “trying to breathe through a really narrow straw.”Though this study focused on pugs, other flat-faced dogs like French and English bulldogs are also known to suffer from breathing difficulties. In April, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the U.K. urged would-be dog owners to avoid buying puppies of flat-faced breeds, saying “it’s wrong that we’re knowingly breeding for features which compromise their health.”And in February, Norway went a step further and banned the breeding of English bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles spaniels due to the breathing problems and other health issues they exhibit."}, {"title": "Family Hears Noise, Finds 550-Pound Alligator 'Taking A Dip' In Their Pool", "text": "Bring a pool float, and make it snappy!A Florida family went out to investigate some “loud noises” at their Deep Creek home and discovered a nearly 11-foot alligator “taking a dip in their pool,” according to a Facebook post this week from the Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office.“Coming in at 10′11″ and weighing over 550lbs., he tore through the screen to get to the nice, cool water,” the sheriff’s office said, citing the situation as a reason to “always check your pool before diving in!”A trapper was able to catch and relocate the alligator ― along with another 11-foot gator he had also just trapped ― to Muse, Florida, a town that Sgt. Brad Stender told CNN was “more conducive” to alligators.During the spring and summer, alligators are on the move looking for mates and are more likely to end up closer to people’s homes, Stender said, adding that people should “keep their distance.”“They’re not going to attack you as long as you don’t go up to them,” he said. “Most of the time they’ll go on their way.”Of course, sometimes they get into a little trouble first. Last month, a Florida couple discovered that an alligator had gotten into their garage and gone to town on their soda supply.“Diet Coke was spewing everywhere,” home resident Karen Dobson told the Miami Herald. “It tore open the box, had a few cans.”"}, {"title": "New York's Highest Court Weighs Question Of Whether Elephant Is A Person", "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — She has four limbs, expressive eyes and likes to stroll through greenery in New York City. Happy, by species, is an Asian elephant. But can she also be considered a person?That question was before New York’s highest court Wednesday in a closely watched case over whether a basic human right can be extended to an animal.The advocates at the Nonhuman Rights Project say yes: Happy is an autonomous, cognitively complex elephant worthy of the right reserved in law for “a person.” The Bronx Zoo, where Happy resides, says no: Through an attorney, the zoo argues Happy is neither illegally imprisoned nor a person, but a well-cared-for elephant “respected as the magnificent creature she is.”Happy has lived at the Bronx Zoo for 45 years. The state Court of Appeals heard arguments over whether she should be released through a habeas corpus proceeding, which is a way for people to challenge illegal confinement.The Nonhuman Rights Project wants her moved from a “one-acre prison” at the zoo to a more spacious sanctuary.“She has an interest in exercising her choices and deciding who she wants to be with, and where to go, and what to do, and what to eat,” project attorney Monica Miller told The Associated Press ahead of the oral arguments. “And the zoo is prohibiting her from making any of those choices herself.”The group said that in 2005, Happy became the first elephant to pass a self-awareness indicator test, repeatedly touching a white “X” on her forehead as she looked into a large mirror.The zoo and its supporters warn that a win for advocates at the Nonhuman Rights Project could open the door to more legal actions on behalf of animals, including pets and other species in zoos.“If there’s going to entire be a rewrite and a granting to animals of rights that they never had before, shouldn’t that be done by the Legislature?” Kenneth Manning, an attorney for zoo operator Wildlife Conservation Society, asked the judges.Happy was born in the wild in Asia in the early 1970s, captured and brought as a 1-year-old to the United States, where she was eventually named for one of the characters from “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Happy arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1977 with fellow elephant Grumpy, who was fatally injured in a 2002 confrontation with two other elephants.Happy now lives in an enclosure adjacent to the zoo’s other elephant, Patty. The zoo’s attorney argued in court filings that Happy can swim, forage and engage in other behavior natural for elephants.“The blatant exploitation of Happy the elephant by NRP to advance their coordinated agenda shows no concern for the individual animal and reveals the fact they are willing to sacrifice Happy’s health and psychological well-being to set precedent,” the zoo said in a prepared statement.NRP’s attorneys say no matter how Happy is being treated at the zoo, her right to “bodily liberty” is being violated. They argue that if the court recognizes Happy’s right to that liberty under habeas corpus, she will be a “person” for that purpose. And then she must be released.Judges peppered attorneys for both side with pointed questions during oral arguments. Judge Jenny Rivera asked Miller about the implications of NRP’s position on human-animal relationships.“So does that mean that I couldn’t keep a dog?” Rivera asked. “I mean, dogs can memorize words.”Miller said right now there’s more evidence showing elephants are extraordinarily cognitively complex with advanced analytical abilities.Lower courts have ruled against the NRP. And the group has failed to prevail in similar cases, including those involving a chimpanzee in upstate New York named Tommy.But last October, at the urging of a different animal rights group, a federal judge ruled that Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar’s infamous “cocaine hippos” could be recognized as people or “interested persons” with legal rights in the U.S. The decision had no real ramifications for the hippos themselves, given that they reside in Colombia.Opponents hope the NRP’s string of court losses continues with the high-profile New York court.In a friend-of-the-court brief, the New York Farm Bureau and other agriculture groups said the NRP’s “new-fangled theory of personhood” would sweep up pigs, cows and chickens. The National Association for Biomedical Research said authorizing such petitions on behalf of animals could drive up the costs of conducting critical research. State and national associations representing veterinarians filed a brief saying NRP’s lawsuit promotes animals’ personhood rights above animals’ welfare.Supporters of NRP’s action include public figures such as Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe. Many of them see this case as a chance for society to take a step forward in the ethical treatment of animals.“We believe this legal moment for Happy represents a key cultural crossroads for thinking more openly and honestly—and less selfishly—about what it would mean to treat the particularity of non-human animals with the moral seriousness it deserves,” a brief submitted by Catholic academic theologians read.The court’s decision is expected in the coming months.At least one animal rights advocate suggests a lone court decision won’t change society’s view of animal use. Rutgers Law School professor Gary Francione, who is not involved in the case, said that would require a broader cultural shift.“I’ve been a vegan for 40 years. Don’t get me wrong, I disagree with animal use altogether,” Francione said. “Just to have the court start saying that non-human animals are persons under the law is going to raise all sorts of questions, the answers to which are not going to be amenable to many people.”"}, {"title": "Rare Northern Michigan Tornado Kills 1, Injures More Than 40", "text": "GAYLORD, Mich. (AP) — A rare northern Michigan tornado tore through a small community on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring more than 40 others as it flipped vehicles, tore roofs from buildings and downed trees and power lines.The twister hit Gaylord, a city of about 4,200 people roughly 230 miles (370 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, at around 3:45 p.m.Mike Klepadlo, who owns the car repair shop Alter-Start North, said he and his workers took cover in a bathroom.“I’m lucky I’m alive. It blew the back off the building,” he said. “Twenty feet (6 meters) of the back wall is gone. The whole roof is missing. At least half the building is still here. It’s bad.”Emma Goddard, 15, said she was working at the Tropical Smoothie Cafe when she got a phone alert about the tornado. Thinking the weather outside looked “stormy, but not scary,” she dismissed it and returned to what she was doing. Her mother then called and she assured her mom she was OK.Two minutes later, she was pouring a customer’s smoothie when her coworker’s mom rushed in yelling for them to get to the back of the building, Goddard told The Associated Press by text message. They took shelter in the walk-in cooler, where they could hear windows shattering.“I was crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with my seven co-workers, two of my co-workers’ parents and a lady from Door Dash coming to pick up her smoothies.”When they left the cooler about 15 minutes later and stepped outside, they saw “some of our cars in pieces and insulation all over the ground,” Goddard said. Three neighboring businesses were destroyed, she said.Brian Lawson, a spokesman for Munson Healthcare, said Otsego Memorial Hospital was treating 23 people injured by the tornado and that one person was killed. He didn’t know the conditions of the injured or the name of the person who died.The Michigan State Patrol confirmed that one person was killed, saying in a tweet that more than 40 others were hurt and being treated at area hospitals. The patrol planned to hold a briefing Saturday morning.“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” Mayor Todd Sharrard said. “I’m numb.”Video posted online showed a dark funnel cloud materialize out of a cloud as nervous drivers looked on or slowly drove away, uncertain of its path.Other video showed extensive damage along the city’s Main Street. One building appeared to be largely collapsed and a Goodwill store was badly damaged. A collapsed utility pole lay on the side of the road, and debris, including what appeared to be electrical wires and parts of a Marathon gas station, was scattered all along the street.The Red Cross set up a shelter at a church.Brandie Slough, 42, said she and a teen daughter sought safety in a restroom at a Culver’s. Windows of the fast food restaurant were blown out when they emerged, and her pickup truck had been flipped on its roof in the parking lot.“We shook our heads in disbelief but are thankful to be safe. At that point, who cares about the truck,” Slough said.Eddie Thrasher, 55, said he was sitting in his car outside an auto parts store when the tornado seemed to appear above him.“There are roofs ripped off businesses, a row of industrial-type warehouses,” Thrasher said. “RVs were flipped upside down and destroyed. There were a lot of emergency vehicles heading from the east side of town.”He said he ran into the store to ride it out.“My adrenaline was going like crazy,” Thrasher said. “In less than five minutes it was over.”Extreme winds are uncommon in this part of Michigan because the Great Lakes suck energy out of storms, especially early in spring when the lakes are very cold, said Jim Keysor, a Gaylord-based meteorologist with the National Weather Service.“Many kids and young adults would have never experienced any direct severe weather if they had lived in Gaylord their entire lives,” he said.The last time Gaylord had a severe wind storm was in 1998, when straight-line winds reached 100 mph, Keysor said. He said the conditions that spawned Friday’s twister included a cold front moving in from Wisconsin and hitting hot and humid air over Gaylord, with the added ingredient of turning winds in the lower part of the atmosphere.Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Otsego County, making further state resources available to the county.Gaylord, known as the “Alpine Village,” is set to celebrate its 100th birthday this year, with a centennial celebration that will include a parade and open house at City Hall later this summer.The community also holds the annual Alpenfest in July, an Alpine-inspired celebration honoring the city’s heritage and a partnership with a sister city in Switzerland.___White reported from Detroit.

Gretchen Whitmer (D) for federal funding might prevent the site from going offline.The plant, with the capacity to power 800,000 homes, safely operated for 50 years on the shores of Lake Michigan. But the facility, like many other U.S. nuclear plants, struggled to make money as cheap natural gas gobbled up its share of the electricity market.Utility giant Entergy, the plant’s owner, announced in 2017 it would close the plant by 2022. Last month, Whitmer sent a letter to the Department of Energy formally requesting a share of a $6 billion fund the White House established to bail out financially-troubled but safe-to-operate reactors. Opened in 1971, the plant was licensed to operate through 2031. The plant was scheduled to shut down permanently on May 31.But on Friday Entergy said it moved the closure up by 11 days after its operators identified a “performance issue” with a mechanical part of the reactor, a control rod drive seal, and “made the conservative decision to shut down the plant early.”“The enduring legacy of Palisades is the thousands of men and women who safely, reliably, and securely operated the plant, helping power Southwest Michigan homes and businesses for more than 50 years,” Darrell Corbin, Entergy’s site vice president, said in a press release. “We refer to a credo at Palisades: ‘Palisades Proud.’ Thanks to the pride, professionalism, and hard work of our 600-member team, we finished Palisades Proud.”Workers lamented the closure. Once Entergy removes the reactor, it plans to sell the plant to New Jersey-based Holtec International, a nuclear reactor component maker, to decommission the site.Michigan generates the majority of its electricity by burning natural gas and coal, which cause climate change and spew disease-causing particulate matter into the air. If gas power replaces the electricity Palisades produced, Michigan’s annual greenhouse gas emissions will increase by 2.8 million metric tons, according to an analysis of federal data by the pro-nuclear think tank the Breakthrough Institute. That’s equivalent to adding more than 600,000 cars to the road. If the Great Lake State’s coal-fired J. H. Campbell Generating Plant makes up the difference, emissions will go up by 5.9 million metric tons — equal to nearly 1.3 million additional automobiles.“If Michigan decided to tear up every wind turbine and solar panel in the state there would be outrage,” Zeke Hausfather, a prominent climate scientist who has worked on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, wrote on Twitter in response to the news. “This is the same amount of carbon free energy lost.”Fossil fuels have replaced nuclear plants in virtually every place where reactors shut down. After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Germany began rapidly closing its nuclear plants even as it sought to open new coal mines. The country became more reliant on Russian natural gas. Now, as the war in Ukraine compels Germany to slash its Russian imports, Europe’s largest economy is considering extending its deadline for quitting coal entirely.In April, the Indian Point Energy Center, the nuclear plant that provided the bulk of New York City’s zero-carbon electricity, permanently closed after decades of protests by environmentalists. Overnight, fossil fuels’ share of the grid that powers the nation’s largest city soared to 90%.Critics of nuclear power say the energy source’s 80-year safety record does not justify the potentially catastrophic risks of human error, exemplified in the only two deadly reactor meltdowns in history, Fukushima and 1986’s Chernobyl. Another lesser accident, the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island in 1979, stoked those fears closer to home. Depictions in popular culture including hit documentaries and miniseries on those past accidents, and Homer Simpson, the buffoonish nuclear plant operator in “The Simpsons,” have driven home the risks associated with atomic energy.But pro-nuclear advocates say the industry’s steady safety improvements and stringent regulation make it a vital tool, especially given the unrivaled efficiency and reliability of producing electricity with heat from a fission reaction. And they say the risks fossil fuels pose, both to the planet’s habitability and the health of communities living nearby, are far greater.Many environmentalists hope renewables alone can provide enough electricity to simultaneously phase out nuclear power and fossil fuels. But solar and wind power depend on weather conditions and require huge numbers of panels and turbines to produce electricity in the volumes needed to equal fission or fossil. Improved transmission infrastructure would help move renewable electricity from where it’s abundant to where it’s needed, but local opposition to power lines has made them difficult to build. And the more climate-polluting sectors like transportation and building heating transition to electric alternatives, the more that power will be needed on the grid.Diablo Canyon Power Plant, California’s last nuclear station and the source of nearly 10% of the state’s electricity, is now the next of the U.S.’s remaining 90 or so plants slated for closure, in 2025.Despite already contributing by far the largest share of humanity’s cumulative carbon dioxide mess in the atmosphere, the U.S. has struggled to lower its emissions in the face of mounting warming-fueled disasters and dire warnings from scientists. The country’s carbon output increased 6% last year as the economy rebounded from pandemic-related lockdowns. Emissions are expected to grow by another 2% this year."}, {"title": "Watchdog Re-Ups IRS Complaint Against A Nonprofit Fighting Biden’s Conservation Goal", "text": "A progressive watchdog group has renewed its call for the IRS to investigate whether a Texas-based property rights organization is violating its tax-exempt nonprofit status as it campaigns against the Biden administration’s goal of conserving 30% of lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30.”Accountable.US filed an initial complaint with the IRS last year, accusing the fringe, right-wing American Stewards of Liberty of violating its 501(c)(3) status by lobbying against 30x30 at the federal, state and local levels. This week, Accountable amended its complaint with new evidence, including internal communications that HuffPost obtained via a public records request. Accountable argues that the new evidence further proves American Stewards is working to influence legislation in violation of tax code rules.As HuffPost revealed last month, Margaret Byfield, the executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, developed a cozy relationship inside Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts’ office, and worked behind the scenes to guide the Republican governor’s response to 30x30. Byfield advised Ricketts on the conservation initiative and other environmental policy issues, even playing a direct role in crafting an executive order, signed by the governor in late June, that aimed to prevent President Joe Biden from implementing his 30x30 plan in Nebraska.In a supplemental letter sent to the IRS on Thursday, Accountable.US noted that American Stewards has “expanded its federal lobbying efforts” and is publicly backing a pair of congressional bills, dubbed the “30x30 Termination Act,” that seek to block Biden’s 30x30 pledge. Two of the bills’ main sponsors, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), were keynote speakers at American Stewards’ “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska, last month.The letter also cites HuffPost’s recent reporting on Byfield’s influence within Ricketts’ office, and how she requested and apparently secured a statement from the governor in support of Boebert’s anti-30x30 bill.“By its own admission, a significant portion of American Stewards’ activities involve attempts to influence legislation, and its primary objective can only be achieved through advocating for or against legislation,” Jordan Schreiber, energy and environment director at Accountable.US, said in a statement. “Such an approach violates their nonprofit tax status.”American Stewards has advanced sweeping, evidence-free claims that the 30x30 initiative is a federal “land grab” in disguise. Its rhetoric is now being parroted by a growing number of Republican lawmakers and right-wing organizations. And the disinformation-rich campaign has succeeded in drumming up fear in rural communities about a looming federal takeover of private property rights.Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist and ethics expert at the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen, agrees that American Stewards’ activities run afoul of its tax-exempt status. He noted that in its newsletter, American Stewards has called on its audience to contact their elected representatives to urge them to back specific legislation.“This constitutes ‘indirect lobbying,’ which is prohibited for charities,” Holman said via email.The IRS did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. On its website, however, it explains that “a 501(c)(3) organization may engage in some lobbying, but too much lobbying activity risks loss of tax-exempt status.”“An organization will be regarded as attempting to influence legislation if it contacts, or urges the public to contact, members or employees of a legislative body for the purpose of proposing, supporting, or opposing legislation, or if the organization advocates the adoption or rejection of legislation,” the agency’s website reads.In a May 2021 newsletter, American Stewards wrote: “If your Representative is not signed on, please call their office and request they co-sponsor Rep. Boebert’s ‘30 x 30 Termination Act.’ Deadline to sign on is this Friday.”Additionally, Holman said the revelations in HuffPost’s report last month — namely, that Byfield helped craft Ricketts’ executive order on 30x30 and procure a statement from the governor in support of Boebert’s legislation — constitute “direct lobbying,” which is also prohibited for 501(c)(3) nonprofits.“There appears to be many different activities that qualify American Stewards as an ‘action organization,’ and thereby disqualifying it from tax-exempt status,” Holman said. “By all accounts, the IRS should take a closer look at the operations of American Stewards of Liberty and decide whether the organization is worthy of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.”Byfield did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. She is, however, keenly aware of Accountable.US and its work. In emails to one of Ricketts’ top staffers, which HuffPost obtained as part of its records request, Byfield warned that Accountable.US had been filing public records requests for American Stewards’ communications with counties in numerous states — “Your office may receive a similar request,” she wrote — and scrutinizing the group’s tax status.And at the “Stop 30x30 Summit” last month, Trump-era Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, one of the event’s keynote speakers, slammed the organization’s president, Kyle Herrig, for an op-ed he wrote about American Stewards ahead of its summit in Nebraska.“I don’t like bullies,” Bernhardt said, referring to Herrig. “Where I’m from, people don’t bully each other.”In May 2021, Bernhardt donated $2,000 to Boebert’s reelection campaign. Boebert, who represents Bernhardt’s hometown of Rifle, Colorado, is herself notorious for bullying, trolling and mocking people on Twitter."}, {"title": "Carpenters Trade Union Bets Big On America's Transition To Renewable Energy", "text": "SICKLERVILLE, N.J. — On an overcast day last week, a union carpenter welded steel plates together at the bottom of a man-made lake as interested onlookers gathered around a laptop on a floating barge above to watch a live-feed video of his work.For years, the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters recruited commercial divers from Divers Academy International, a dive school outside Philadelphia. But in February, the union purchased the property as part of a broader effort to get out ahead of what many anticipate — and hope — will soon be a booming offshore wind industry along the East Coast.It is the first union-owned and operated commercial dive school in the nation.“What do they say, ‘Build it and they will come?’ Well, we bought it, so bring them on,” William Sproule, executive secretary-treasurer of EASRCC, told a room full of union piledrivers, millwrights and carpenters during a tour of the facility.President Joe Biden set a goal of securing 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, enough to power 10 million homes for a year and cut 78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. And he and his administration talk often about how deploying clean energy and confronting global climate change is an opportunity to create millions of high-paying union jobs.Erecting wind farms at sea requires a lot of underwater work, including welding and inspections. As soon as this summer, the union will be able to provide its members with in-house training in underwater welding and other specialized skills required in the construction and maintenance of offshore wind turbines, oil rigs, bridges, dams, nuclear power plants and shipyards.EASRCC purchased the dive school for $1.9 million after the school’s previous owner landed in legal and financial trouble, and has so far invested another $500,000 in repairing and upgrading equipment at the facility. The school features classrooms, offices, a dock with dive and underwater welding stations and a decompression chamber. The facility is in the process of being certified by the Association of Diving Contractors International.The carpenter’s union is betting on America’s energy transition and the jobs that are promised to come with it. In late 2020, before investing in its own dive school, it spent approximately $800,000 on a 13-acre lot where it is building out an expanded heavy construction, pile driving and offshore wind training facility. The site is located across the street from the union’s existing training center in Hammonton, New Jersey, approximately 30 miles northwest of Atlantic City. What was recently a forested area of the Pine Barrens is now clear of trees and features mock-up construction sites.As carpenters, local elected officials, wind industry representatives and members of the public gathered at the facility for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new training grounds on May 11, apprentices and journeypersons trained on a crane, pile driver and other heavy machinery. A solar array has already gone up in one corner of the property. The union is now working to secure its own wind turbine and GE-manufactured nacelle, which houses the turbine’s gears and other electronics, in order to train millwrights on installation and maintenance.Sproule called the facility “a dream come true” and expects the return on investment to be huge.“We’re ready to train the workforce for this industry that is going to be a big part of New Jersey’s economy,” Sproule said. “We’re hoping this will create opportunities for all kinds of young adults that may be interested in getting involved.”Sproule is a first-generation carpenter and 33-year union member. He got his start in the trade in 1989 and spent the final years of his apprenticeship training at the Hammonton facility. The skills he learned during that time allowed him to move up the union ladder, from apprentice to journeyman and eventually agent and organizer. But what he realized during his years laboring in Atlantic City on high-rise buildings and the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector tunnel was how difficult it is for workers to hone heavy machinery skills in a shop or classroom setting. Those skills largely came with experience in the field.He wanted training to mimic that.“I always had a vision to someday take things outside,” he told HuffPost. “It’s all about hands-on work with cranes and equipment, just like real-world job sites, so our apprentices have more experience before they even hit the job site.”EASRCC is one of several councils within the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, one of the largest building trade unions in North America. The council represents some 41,000 members in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia.The union’s efforts are significant for a trade that has long relied on fossil fuel industry jobs, including pipeline and refinery construction. While there is a lot of excitement about offshore wind within the union, there is trepidation among members in fossil fuel-producing states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia, Sproule said. He said he doesn’t expect renewable energy to take hold overnight but wants workers to be prepared as the sector continues to grow.“We’re at the beginning of something,” Sproule said. “It’s almost like a revolution. As ratepayers and taxpayers and people that depend on having electricity for our homes, we have to support all forms and methods of creating electricity and transmitting energy, but we want to be a part of this renewable [transition] because we know this is a big part of the future.”The U.S. lags far behind Europe on offshore wind production; however, the nascent industry looks poised to take off. EASRCC’s recent investments are aimed at ensuring union carpenters in the Eastern Atlantic and around the country are proficient and competitive when offshore wind developers begin filling jobs. While pile drivers and millwrights will be needed for the installation and maintenance of offshore wind farms, other skilled carpenters will be key for building out transmission lines and other supporting infrastructure on land.“We’re always thinking ahead,” said Frank Mahoney, a spokesman for the union. “If we’re not ready, we could easily lose out. The carpenters we train could lose out.”The Biden administration has made strides toward its wind energy goals. It granted final approval to two major offshore wind projects: the long-stalled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, and South Fork Wind project off Rhode Island. It established a new priority wind area in New York Bight, the waters between Long Island and the New Jersey coast, and advanced permitting for the proposed 1,100-megawatt Ocean Wind project off the coast of southern New Jersey. Its first offshore wind lease sale in February brought in a stunning $4.37 billion in high bids — more than any offshore energy auction in U.S. history, including all oil and gas lease sales — across nearly half a million acres in New York Bight. And the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that President Joe Biden championed and Congress passed last year included $65 billion for electricity grid upgrades that will support the emerging offshore wind sector.New Jersey itself is angling to become the hub of the U.S. offshore wind sector. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy set a goal of developing 7.5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, enough to power 3 million homes in the Garden State. In April, EEW American Offshore Structures broke ground on a $250 million monopile manufacturing facility at the Port of Paulsboro, on the Delaware River outside Philadelphia, where union laborers will construct the massive, 2,500-ton steel tubes that will anchor turbines to the seafloor. Work is also underway on the New Jersey Wind Port, where turbine blades and nacelles will be assembled and staged before being transported out to sea.All told, offshore wind could generate $150 billion in private investment in New Jersey alone over the next 15 years, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in April. And job creation has already started.“It’s happening. The creation of thousands of jobs is happening in the offshore wind industry, including carpenters, laborers, electricians, engineers and diesel mechanics,” New Jersey Labor Commissioner Rob Asaro-Angelo said at last week’s event in Hammonton. “The increase in job opportunities here [is] going to provide unbelievable opportunities for all of our families in South Jersey and across the country.”There are major discrepancies in wages for fossil fuel workers versus those in the renewable energy sector, however. A report last year from clean energy think tank Energy Futures Initiative found that the median hourly wages of oil, natural gas and coal workers were $26.59, $30.33 and $28.69, respectively, compared to $24.48 for solar and $25.48 for wind. That wage gap is at least in part due to there being approximately double the number of unionized workers in fossil fuels than in renewables.Closing these gaps will be key for renewable energy developers to attract workers. At least two major offshore wind developers, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind and Ørsted, have signed agreements to use union labor for their planned projects. And Atlantic Power Transmission LLC, a Blackstone company vying to build the transmission lines that connect offshore wind farms to the grid, has partnered with EASRCC and other unions and committed to investing $50 million for workforce development in New Jersey.Andy Geissbuehler, the CEO of APT, told HuffPost at EASRCC’s ribbon-cutting ceremony last week that it is critical that states like New Jersey continue to move quickly on workforce training, and for manufacturing facilities and supply chains to be in close proximity to where wind farms are being developed.“We need to build this industry now,” he said. “If you compare with onshore wind, the U.S. was very late with onshore wind. But you know how it goes. We are very fast, we catch up, and now we are a global leader. The same should happen in offshore wind.”Angela Woodman, an Army veteran and apprentice piledriver, is among those who stand to benefit from the anticipated boom. She joined the union’s Sisters in the Brotherhood program four years ago after her sister told her about it. Her first week in, she saw a video about dock building and decided that’s what she wanted to do.Woodman isn’t one to work a desk job. She likes being outside, working with her hands and getting dirty, and her years as a union laborer have been some of the most enjoyable of her life, she said.She hasn’t closely followed the latest news on offshore wind along the East Coast but is plugged in enough to be excited about both the environmental benefits and the career opportunities it will bring to her home state of New Jersey. A skilled welder, she plans to look into what it would take to use those skills underwater and get certified as a commercial diver.More than anything, she said, carpenters want stable, long-term work. And the construction of several massive offshore wind farms promises just that.“The working-class people got to stay working,” she said.Language has been amended to clarify the union’s previous relationship with the dive school."}, {"title": "Trump Nominees Still Control A Key Mine Safety Agency Well Into Biden’s Second Year", "text": "Sixteen months into the Biden presidency, Republicans still effectively control a federal agency that oversees mine safety, frustrating miner advocates who say the Trump nominees will continue to hand down decisions friendly to mine operators.Not many people outside the industry would be familiar with the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, an independent agency that reviews legal disputes stemming from citations and fines against mining companies. But the commission plays a crucial role in making sure workers come out of their mines alive, by interpreting health and safety law and seeing that it’s properly enforced by federal inspectors.When the Mine Safety and Health Administration issues fines against a mine operator, the operator can appeal them to the commission. In general, a commission more aligned with operators than safety hawks is going to make it harder for inspectors to enforce the law aggressively.The commission is supposed to have five sitting members who serve staggered terms and adjudicate cases as a panel. By tradition, the president’s party gets three members and the other party gets two. But right now, the agency only has three Senate-confirmed commissioners, with a 2-1 GOP majority. The two Republican members, William Althen and Marco Rajkovich, are longtime lawyers for mining companies.The lone Democrat is Art Traynor, a union lawyer formerly with the United Mine Workers of America. President Joe Biden designated Traynor the commission’s chair, but Traynor can still be outvoted by his two GOP counterparts on contentious cases that set precedent. Such decisions can determine when a mine operator might be fined for safety violations, or when a miner is protected under the law for their safety activism.The White House has put up two more nominees who, if confirmed, would fill all the commission’s seats and create the 3-2 Democratic majority expected under a Democratic president. Those nominees have cleared the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions but still have not gotten a vote on the Senate floor.Elections are supposed to determine the direction of federal policy, but lesser-known agencies like the mine commission often wind up rudderless for long stretches, said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks presidential nominees. Stier said the Biden White House, like most recent administrations, has been slow to fill many roles (though not as slow as former President Donald Trump). He said much of the problem lies with the Senate.“It’s a classic small pipe with too much being jammed through it,” he said. “It’s the agencies that don’t have the overall political pull that end up falling by the wayside.”Tony Oppegard, a lawyer who represents miners in safety cases, said he has long viewed the commission as too favorable to operators. He was hoping the Democratic election victories in 2020 would change its complexion and lead to decisions that strengthen the law in miners’ favors. He noted that the commission shapes safety not just in coal mines but in metal and nonmetal mines across the country as well.“It’s not right to have a Democratic president and Republicans constituting the majority of the commission,” said Oppegard, many of whose clients are safety whistleblowers. “For all miners in the U.S., these are extremely important positions, because they interpret the law of the [Mine Safety and Health Act] and all the intricacies of that law.”An aide for Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the HELP committee, said she was pressing for a floor vote for the would-be commissioners.“Senator Murray is pushing hard to confirm Mary Lu Jordan and T.J. Baker — two highly qualified nominees committed to mine workers’ safety — and believes there is simply no reason for any further delay,” the aide said in an email.But even if the commission winds up with a Democratic majority, it might not last long.All three of the current commissioners were appointed by the previous administration and confirmed by the then-GOP-controlled Senate as a group in 2019. But the Trump administration placed Traynor, the only Democrat, in the commission seat set to expire first, a move that could end up strengthening the GOP’s hold on the commission. Traynor’s seat comes open this August, while Althen and Rajkovich hold their seats until August 2024.That means even if Democrats approve the two nominees awaiting a Senate vote, they would need to promptly reconfirm Traynor or install a new nominee in his place in order to avoid a 2-2 commission that might deadlock on cases by the end of the summer.With control of the commission essentially up for grabs, the agency has turned into a political football.As E&E News recently reported, Republicans with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform have accused Traynor of “political interference” and “inappropriate management practices” as the commission’s chair. Traynor told HuffPost the allegations are an untrue smear. But even if unfounded, they could hurt Traynor’s prospects for reappointment, forcing Democrats to get another nominee through the process to establish a majority on the commission.Traynor said the Trump administration’s maneuvering with commission seats has left Democrats with three consecutive seats to fill from their own party, making a bipartisan compromise less likely with Republicans.“Since it’s all Democrats, they’ve unleashed the slime,” he said.Traynor recently sent a letter to the HELP committee alleging “seriously unethical and criminal misconduct” by commission employees under the watch of Althen and Rajkovich, including fraudulent work benefits being issued through a COVID-19 relief program, according to E&E. Althen and Rajkovich have called the allegations false.Traynor said his biggest concern is how safety law is being shaped. He said the commission will tilt the law in mine operators’ favor so long as Republicans outnumber Democrats.“In their short time in the majority, they have done a lot of damage to the legal protections that have been in place for miners for decades,” he said.Althen said he took offense to that.“This stuff about us undercutting miner safety is just not true,” he said. “I completely reject the notion that operator lawyers are bad people who don’t care about the workers. I’ve been at fatality sites.”Rajkovich declined an interview request but said in an email that the idea that the Republican commissioners would undermine safety is “erroneous.”“I have spent a lifetime in the mining field always placing safety first,” he said. “As a Commissioner, my role (and the role of all Commissioners) is to take an impartial view and decide cases fairly, and based on the law.”Perhaps the most contentious case before the commission involves a subsidiary of coal giant Peabody Energy. The majority could set a precedent that makes it easier for mine operators to avoid “significant and substantial” safety violations, saving tens of thousands of dollars in potential fines and avoiding mine shutdowns. Traynor says that the majority’s position would make it much harder to enforce a requirement that operators have underground shelters for miners in emergency situations.The commission has not yet issued its decision. In a public hearing last year, Traynor argued that his colleagues were going out of their way to alter a prior decision to the industry’s benefit. The hearing grew heated, with Traynor calling Rajkovich dishonest, and Traynor and Althen eventually shouting at one another. Althen accused Traynor of slow-walking the case so they couldn’t issue the decision, saying Traynor was “looking for two more commissioners.”The midterm elections this fall could further complicate efforts to reshape the commission, depending on how long seats go vacant. If Republicans end up taking control of the Senate next year, they could block Biden from filling any open positions, preventing a Democratic majority.Similar problems hang over another worker safety agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which adjudicates citations issued by OSHA inspectors. That agency is a three-member body, but it currently has just two Senate-confirmed commissioners, one Democrat and one Republican.The White House withdrew the nomination of a potential third commissioner, Democrat Susan Harthill, without an explanation last month. As with the mine safety review commission, it isn’t clear when the agency will have all its seats filled and controlled by a Democratic majority.Debbie Berkowitz, a workplace safety expert and former OSHA official, said a deadlocked commission will be unable to decide certain cases where the commissioners don’t agree. And under the law, she said, employers won’t have to address the alleged hazards in their OSHA citations so long as the appeals are sitting there with the commission.“It’s good for Republicans and their big business supporters that these agencies either don’t function or they remain in Republican hands,” she said. “Who suffers are mine workers and other workers in dangerous industries.”"}, {"title": "Dog On The Mend After Rescuing Owner From Mountain Lion", "text": "Not all heroes wear capes.According to Erin Wilson, her dog saved her life on Monday.Wilson was walking near the Trinity River in a rural area in northern California when a mountain lion approached and lunged at her, swiping and scratching her left shoulder, Wilson told the Sacramento Bee.“I yelled out for help from my dog Eva.

At the entrance to the village, a pile of logs creates a makeshift barricade. Beyond it, a cluster of five small wood-framed homes sit on trailers, their walls decorated with colorful murals depicting elements of the Secwepemc people’s history and culture.About half a dozen people live in the village, but those numbers are frequently swelled by visitors, and in mid-December, the site was bustling with activity. Flora Sampson, a tribal elder, gave lessons on the Secwepemc language to camp participants, together with her granddaughter. Others performed songs on deerskin drums and told stories about the recent history of Secwepemc land struggles. Earlier in the year, residents made daily trips to the nearby river to honor and celebrate the thrashing, silvery salmon and trout migrating upstream.“Like my grandpa George says, our culture flows from the land, our language flows from the land,” said Kanahus Manuel, who together with her twin sister Mayuk founded the Tiny House Warriors village in 2017. “When we resist and stand up and fight back, we’re saving ourselves from extinction.”As much as the Tiny House Warriors village has been a hub for maintaining Indigenous culture, it has also been a hub of resistance. The homes sit on a road alongside a construction site related to a massive expansion of the federally owned Trans Mountain Pipeline, a 1,150-km (710-mile) pipeline that carries 300,000 barrels of tar sands diluted bitumen every day from Alberta through British Columbia to an endpoint on the Canadian coast outside Vancouver. First proposed by the energy company Kinder Morgan in 2013, the expansion project would place a new pipeline alongside the existing one, almost tripling the system’s total capacity to 890,000 barrels per day.Canadian officials are relying on the project to move the country closer to its goal of becoming a global “energy superpower,” as then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper pledged in 2006. At the center of his plan was the development of Alberta’s tar sands, enormous underground reserves of sand, clay, and oil spanning an area approximately the size of Florida. In the following years, energy companies proposed a series of new pipelines across Canada and the United States to deliver the high carbon-emitting oil from the tar sands to refineries and markets abroad, including the Trans Mountain expansion, Keystone XL, Northern Gateway, Energy East, and Enbridge Line 3.Today, roughly 3.5 million barrels of tar sands are mined daily, nearly all of it shipped to U.S. refineries. Opponents of tar sands development, however, view it as a fulcrum for the rapidly accelerating climate crisis. The Northern Gateway and Energy East pipelines were canceled in 2016 and 2017 in the face of protests, and the Biden administration revoked the construction permit for Keystone XL last year. Construction of Line 3 was finally completed in September 2021, after overcoming a large opposition movement that saw over 900 arrests in protests across Minnesota.For now, the Trans Mountain expansion is the only major tar sands pipeline battle currently at hand. The Canadian government has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure its completion. “Right now, we’re prisoners to the American market,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in 2019 when announcing the project’s approval. Construction of the expanded pipeline began later that year, and the government hopes it will be up and running by fall 2023.But the project has run up against determined opposition from First Nations groups and environmentalists, as well as municipalities, student groups, and some labor groups and politicians. Since the project’s proposal in 2013, protesters have staged dozens of actions to block construction along the pipeline’s route, resulting in over 300 arrests. Well over a dozen legal challenges have been mounted since the project was first announced, including by numerous First Nations, like the Tsleil-Waututh Nation.The Tiny House Warriors village has been a prominent flashpoint in the conflict. Nearly half of the pipeline expansion’s proposed route lies within the territory of the Secwepemc Nation, which, like nearly all First Nations in British Columbia, has never relinquished its land to the Canadian government by treaty, land sale, or surrender. Secwepemc opponents of the project have argued that its construction violates their right to govern their own territory. By establishing a small village in the project’s path, the Tiny House Warriors have staked claim to land they argue belongs to their people.In recent years, the Canadian government has been working to acknowledge its legacy of colonialism and heal its relationship with Indigenous people. However, the government and pipeline companies have fiercely opposed Indigenous land claims in court. In particular, they’ve used court-ordered injunctions to force First Nations peoples off their land through police enforcement, according to researchers at the Yellowhead Institute, a First Nations-led think tank at Ryerson University. These injunctions, which can prevent protesters from blocking pipeline construction and other commercial activities such as logging and mining, have enabled the government and energy companies to make an end run around Indigenous land claims. This dynamic is playing out vividly at the Tiny House Warriors village.“Basically everything about the legal system is skewed against Native people,” said Pam Palmater, an Indigenous Mi’kmaq lawyer, Ryerson University professor, and activist. “Federal and provincial governments and even corporations use the justice system, they weaponize it against First Nations, land defenders, Indigenous people in a multitude of ways.”The Tiny House Warriors village was first established in 2017, after a traditional Secwepemc assembly declared its opposition to the Trans Mountain expansion, arguing that the project posed a threat to the local ecology and their land. But there are other motivations as well. Village inhabitants say the impending influx of construction workers to the site will pose a safety risk to women in the area; a 2019 report by Canada’s National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found “substantial evidence” that temporary worker camps increase violence against women in nearby communities.Tensions have risen steadily in recent years. In 2017, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the country’s federal law enforcement agency, formed a special unit called the Community-Industry Response Group to address issues of crime, national security, and public disorder surrounding energy projects in British Columbia — including protests in opposition to Trans Mountain and the Coastal GasLink pipeline, which is being built in a separate part of the province and is being blockaded by the Wet’suwet’en people and their supporters. In October 2019, a C-IRG officer fractured Kanahus Manuel’s wrist, she said, while arresting her on an access road about 37 miles north of the Tiny House Warriors village on charges of intimidation and mischief. An RCMP spokesperson said that following her arrest, Manuel was assessed at the local hospital and taken to a larger hospital, and that no evidence of a broken wrist had been provided to police. The spokesperson also said that a broken bone would trigger an investigation by the Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia, a civilian-led police oversight agency, and that no such investigation was launched. Manuel and a fellow protester were later acquitted of all charges in connection with the incident, and Manuel has filed a federal lawsuit seeking damages. The RCMP spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.The conflict intensified in July 2021 when workers began preparing a swath of forest to make way for a camp that would house up to 550 pipeline personnel for the duration of the Trans Mountain expansion’s construction. As part of that, the workers set up fencing near the Tiny House Warriors village and installed a high-tech surveillance system with cameras that appear to be monitoring the tiny homes, according to civil liberties advocates who visited the site.“This is an area where we walked down to the river for more than three years to offer prayers,” Mayuk Manuel said. “And then they go and clear-cut the area and put us under 24-hour surveillance.”In September 2021, several members of the Tiny House Warriors attempted to create a blockade using a large red cloth to stall semi-trucks hauling logs from the worker camp. On the following day, a security guard contracted by Trans Mountain tackled an unidentified Indigenous woman as she approached a security communications post at the construction site, sparking a melee between the protesters and pipeline security personnel. Videos of the incident obtained by Type Investigations and HuffPost show that in the ensuing scuffle, a security guard forcefully pinned Mayuk Manuel to the ground with his knee. Following a further struggle, she and the other protesters were able to escape.Police later arrested five Indigenous protesters, including Mayuk Manuel, in connection with the incident. The British Columbia crown counsel charged them with varying combinations of assault, assault causing bodily harm, mischief, and other charges. No pipeline workers were arrested or charged in connection with the incident.A Trans Mountain spokesperson said the company “respects the right to peaceful, lawful expressions of opinions,” and that it is “committed to ensuring our workforce demonstrates our core values of safety, integrity, and respect.” However, according to the spokesperson, the protesters had initiated the conflict by breaking through fencing, throwing rocks and debris at workers, and damaging equipment, thereby jeopardizing the safety of workers. “The events of September 15, 2021, were not activities of peaceful protestors but were premeditated attempts to stop work and damage equipment,” the spokesperson said.Trans Mountain says it “strives to be a good neighbor” and ensure that its workers are courteous and respectful to local communities during construction. The Tiny House Warriors, however, view the presence of pipeline personnel at the site as a provocation.“Our direct action happened in self-defense,” Kanahus Manuel said. “This entire situation illustrates exactly why we created our tiny homes village to begin with — to protect against the violence the Canadian government is bringing on our people here, especially our women and two-spirit people.”The Tiny House Warriors’ struggle stems from a two-pronged effort by Indigenous people in Canada to assert authority over their land in recent decades — by strengthening their stature within the country’s legal and political systems, but also outside of them, based on Indigenous values and systems. On the first front, First Nations won rights and protections under the Canadian constitution in the early 1980s, after which many groups began pursuing aggressive legal campaigns to assert sovereign rights and title over their traditional territories.In a seminal 1997 case, the Canadian supreme court affirmed Indigenous groups’ right to claim use and occupation of their land if they could prove they had occupied it before the “assertion of Crown sovereignty,” among other criteria. Another major decision came in 2014 when the supreme court sided with the Tsilhqot’in people over British Columbia after the provincial government granted a commercial logging license on traditional Tsilhqot’in land, further establishing Indigenous ownership of land in British Columbia that First Nations people had not given up via treaty.​Indigenous groups have used these precedents to mount challenges to similar projects across Canada. In the case of the Trans Mountain expansion, First Nations groups including the Secwepemc have filed a number of legal challenges, arguing that the Canadian government failed to properly consult First Nations and infringed on their land titles when it approved the project. One of these lawsuits, brought by the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and Coldwater First Nations, significantly delayed the start of Trans Mountain’s construction, though the project was ultimately allowed to move forward. Meanwhile, court-ordered injunctions have enabled corporations and the Canadian government to combat on-the-ground resistance to projects like the Trans Mountain expansion, allowing construction and resource extraction to continue while larger legal questions of Aboriginal land title wind their way through the court system.In 2014, a court granted Kinder Morgan’s application for an injunction covering the Trans Mountain expansion. The company had argued that the protests surrounding the project threatened to cause delays and uncertainty, costing the company millions of dollars in revenue. In 2018, the supreme court of British Columbia agreed to grant a new, province-wide injunction forbidding anyone from obstructing or impeding work on the Trans Mountain project and empowering police to arrest anyone who comes within 5 meters (about 16 feet) of the work site. Most people who are found guilty of violating the injunction are subject to seven to 28 days in jail, though in one recent case, prosecutors are seeking up to 60 days of jail time for someone who was convicted of violating the injunction.Even so, Kinder Morgan moved to cancel the project that year, citing opposition to the project from British Columbia’s provincial government, though Indigenous critics of the project say their own opposition played a central part as well. But Trudeau swept in to buy the project for $3.5 billion ($4.5 billion Canadian) in an effort to keep it alive.Miriam Galipeau, a spokesperson for Natural Resources Canada, said the Canadian government considered the environmental, social, and economic impacts the Trans Mountain expansion project would have, including the impact to Indigenous rights and interests, and ultimately determined the project was in the public interest. “Indigenous communities have diverse views about natural resource development in their territories,” Galipeau said. “We respect those diverse views, as well as the right of all people to voice those views in a safe, responsible and lawful way. We are committed to maintaining strong and enduring relationships with Indigenous communities through ongoing dialogue, established relationships and helping communities navigate matters related to accommodation measures, or any other project-related issues.”“No relationship is more important to the government than the one with Indigenous peoples,” Galipeau said. “We recognize that some Indigenous peoples are in support of this project, while others are opposed.”The Trans Mountain spokesperson said the pipeline expansion project has involved “unprecedented levels of involvement, and shared decision making, with Indigenous peoples and communities,” which have led to route changes, new construction techniques, and economic opportunities for local communities. “Through job creation, procurement opportunities, partnerships, and involvement in the environmental management and oversight process, long-term legacy and economic benefits for Indigenous peoples are being created,” the spokesperson said.Indeed, opposition to the project is not uniform among Indigenous people. Some First Nations-led groups are making a play to purchase an equity stake in the pipeline. Meanwhile, according to Trans Mountain, as of November 2021, 67 Indigenous communities along the pipeline route have signed mutual benefit agreements with the company worth $580 million; those agreements often include financial compensation, job training programs, and a role in contract procurement. Simpcw Resources Group, a construction company owned by a Secwepemc band, the Simpcw First Nation, for instance, partnered with construction firm ATCO Structures to operate three pipeline worker camps in interior British Columbia — including the camp that has been contested by the Tiny House Warriors.Nicole Plato, a spokesperson for the Simpcw Resources Group, shared a 2020 joint statement from Simpcw Chief Shelly Loring and Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc Chief Rosanne Casimir in which they expressed their support for the Trans Mountain expansion project and called on the Tiny House Warriors to end their protest. “By providing opportunities for our people, we will continue to strengthen our economy in a way that still respects and honors the importance of Mother Earth for future generations,” Loring said in the statement.But some Indigenous leaders who have signed such agreements have publicly insisted that the agreements do not necessarily mean they support the pipeline project. A few have noted that the economic poverty that afflicts native communities makes these deals difficult to pass up, while others have expressed a sense of the project’s inevitability, Vice News reported.However, it is often economic interests, rather than concerns over the environment or land rights, that ultimately win out. One reason injunctions have been so effective in combating Indigenous land claims is that judges base their decisions, in part, on the extent to which each party will be impacted if the project moves ahead — a legal test known as the “balance of convenience.” In a precedent-setting 2004 case, a judge wrote in an opinion that the balance of convenience “tips the scales in favor of protecting jobs and government revenues, with the result that Aboriginal interests tend to ‘lose’ outright pending a final determination of the issue, instead of being balanced appropriately against conflicting concerns.” By and large, courts have viewed energy projects’ potential economic losses as a greater harm than the potential violation of Indigenous rights.Even though Indigenous groups can also apply for injunctions, those efforts have seldom been successful in recent decades. Despite the increasing recognition of Indigenous rights in the courts, judges have granted Indigenous applications for injunctions against corporations only 19%of the time, according to a review of over 100 injunction cases since 1974 from a 2019 report by the Yellowhead Institute. By contrast, an updated August 2020 count shows that courts have granted injunctions against Indigenous people sought by companies and governments 81%and 90%of the time, respectively. The Yellowhead Institute’s research shows that corporations are filing injunctions with increasing frequency.“When considering the injunctions brought before them by resource companies, courts tend not to pay any heed to constitutionally-protected Indigenous land claims,” said Shiri Pasternak, an assistant professor of criminology at Ryerson University and one of the report’s co-authors.These injunctions can often include orders to authorize police enforcement of their terms, leading law enforcement officials to arrest pipeline protesters who violate the court orders. In the past two years alone, police have carried out major operations against a number of Indigenous protest groups, including Haudenosaunee people in Caledonia, Ontario, and Gitxsan people in northern British Columbia, for violating injunctions. Police have disrupted a Wet’suwet’en blockade of the Coastal GasLink pipeline three times since January 2019 — most recently in November 2021. “The incident you are referencing was the RCMP enforcing the Supreme Court injunction, as required by law,” the RCMP spokesperson said in response to a question about these operations. “Enforcing these injunctions are not optional for the RCMP, nor can we delay them indefinitely.” In deciding to grant Coastal GasLink’s requests for injunctions against the Wet’suwet’en people, the judge found that because stopping the pipeline would result in a “loss of employment opportunities” and a loss of tax revenue and economic growth, it passed the balance of convenience test.Molly Wickham (Sleydo’), a Wet’suwet’en opponent of the Coastal GasLink project, said injunctions have become a cudgel that police, energy companies, and Canadian officials have been able to use to force Indigenous people off their rightful land. “[Injunctions] are being used as a tool to eradicate and diminish our rights as Indigenous people and our laws that we are upholding. And as a result, we’re spending time in jail or having to be dragged through this court process that’s costing thousands and thousands of dollars,” she said.The consequences of the conflict over the Trans Mountain pipeline go beyond Indigenous land rights. Environmental experts have long warned that expanding production of the tar sands will lock in further increases in global temperatures, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events at a time when climate change is already wreaking devastation on ecosystems and human societies throughout the globe.British Columbia has been particularly hard hit by extreme weather. Last summer, a “heat dome” caused over 500 heat-related deaths and untold numbers of animals to perish across the province. Then, in November, ferocious storms caused flooding and mudslides across the region, with the costs to repair the damage making it the most expensive climate disaster in British Columbia’s history, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Along the route of the Trans Mountain expansion, construction sites and equipment stockpiles were buried by the November landslides, causing massive delays.In April last year, Trudeau pledged to reduce the country’s carbon emissions by 40% to 45%below 2005 levels by 2030, and Canadian officials say the country is still on track to meet its climate goals. Natural Resources Canada said the revenues generated from the Trans Mountain expansion project will be used to fund Canada’s clean energy transition. “Canada is committed to achieving net-zero by 2050,” said Galipeau, the Natural Resources Canada spokesperson. “Our government has committed to capping emissions from Canada’s oil and gas sector in a way that is compatible with our climate objectives.” But Trans Mountain opponents say the government’s support for the pipeline expansion flies in the face of its environmental commitments.“Someday I’m going to have a hard time explaining to a young person that as climate disasters, wildfires, and heat waves, and landslides and floods raged literally all along the route of this pipeline, a prime minister who claimed to be a climate champion continued to try building a pipeline that would enable a major expansion of this country’s most polluting industry,” said Peter McCartney, a climate campaigner for the Vancouver-based Wilderness Committee, which opposes the project.Climate-induced setbacks, combined with regulatory delays and on-the-ground opposition, including by the Tiny House Warriors, have continued to delay construction of the Trans Mountain expansion and caused its estimated cost to balloon to $16.8 billion ($21.4 billion Canadian) — nearly triple the project’s 2017 estimated price tag of $7.4 billion Canadian. In February 2022, the Trudeau administration announced that it would not provide additional public funding to the project. Instead, it has pledged to secure remaining funds from public debt markets or financial institutions, with a goal of placing the pipeline in operation by fall 2023. According to Politico, however, Trudeau’s cabinet recently approved a $10 billion Canadian loan guarantee for the pipeline after it secured funding from a group of unnamed Canadian financial institutions — though the Department of Finance argued that the move does not reflect new public spending. The worker camp near the Blue River is now open, according to Trans Mountain.For now, residents of the Tiny House Warriors village will continue to resist, despite the injunction. Others are doing so as well. Farther downstream from the Tiny House Warriors encampment, where the Fraser River meets the Pacific Ocean and where the Trans Mountain pipeline sends oil out for export, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and other Indigenous peoples and environmental groups have also been rallying in opposition to the project and pressuring the insurance companies underwriting it — including Liberty Mutual and AIG — to cut ties. So far, 18 major international insurance companies have either chosen to rule out insuring the project or are unable to do so because of their policies.Opponents also plan to continue using blockades and other nonviolent direct actions to slow down the project in hopes of ultimately forcing its cancellation. By standing in the way of the Trans Mountain project, the Tiny House Warriors and other Indigenous groups are following in the footsteps of similar pipeline protest movements across North America. And with the demise of Northern Gateway, Energy East, and Keystone XL in recent years, political momentum seems to be shifting to their side. If the Canadian government similarly decides to throw in the towel on Trans Mountain, it would be a hugely consequential victory for environmentalists, as well as for Indigenous people for whom this conflict is part of a longer-term struggle for self-determination over their ancestral land.“Every day, we are striving to become independent, strong, thriving Indigenous nations,” Kanahus Manuel said. “The power that Indigenous people have is often found in being on the ground, in being out on our land — and that also happens to be the biggest threat to this pipeline.”"}, {"title": "'Like An Inferno:' U.S. West Burning At Furious Pace So Far", "text": "LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) — Wildfires are on a furious pace early this year — from a California hilltop where mansions with multimillion-dollar Pacific Ocean views were torched to remote New Mexico mountains charred by a month-old monster blaze.The two places could not be more different, but the elements in common are the same: wind-driven flames have torn through vegetation that is extraordinarily dry from years-long drought exacerbated by climate change.As the unstoppable northern New Mexico wildfire chewed through more dense forest Thursday, firefighters in the coastal community of Laguna Niguel doused charred and smoldering remains of 20 large homes that quickly went up in flames and forced a frantic evacuation.“The sky, everything was orange. It looked like an inferno, so we just jumped in the car,” Sassan Darian said, as he recounted fleeing with his daughter and father while embers swirled around them. “My daughter said, ‘We’re on fire.’ There were sparks on her and we were patting ourselves down.”Nationwide, more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) have burned so far this year — the most at this point since 2018, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Predictions for the rest of the spring do not bode well for the West, with the drought and warmer weather brought on by climate change worsening wildfire danger.“We all know it’s really early for our fire season and we’re all in awe of what we’ve already experienced ... to this point,” said Dave Bales, commander on the New Mexico fire that is the largest burning in the U.S.Fire officials said there was not much they could do in recent days to stop the fast-moving flames burning in tinder-dry forests in the Sangre de Christo range.Fueled by overgrown mountainsides covered with Ponderosa pine and other trees sucked dry of moisture over decades, it’s now burned across more than 405 square miles (1,048 square kilometers) — an area bigger than the city of Dallas, Texas.Crews fighting flames along the mountain fronts between Santa Fe and Taos mostly held their own on Thursday thanks to welcome help from aerial attacks. But fire operations chief Todd Abel said that in some places where winds were gusting over ridgetops, it was “almost like putting a hair dryer on it.”Even small fires that once would have been easily contained are extreme threats to life and property because of climate change, said Brian Fennessy, chief of the Orange County Fire Authority.The perfect example broke out Wednesday afternoon when flames that may have been sparked by electric utility equipment were pushed up a canyon by strong sea breezes and quickly ignited large homes. They burned a relatively small area — about 200 acres (81 hectares) — but left a large path of destruction.A sprawling estate selling for $9.9 million had looked in real estate listings like a California dream: teeming with luxuries that included a two-level library, a “wellness wing” with sauna and steam room and a pool on a terrace overlooking scenic Laguna Beach.By nightfall, the mansion once photographed against a pastel sunset had morphed into a nightmare: its arched facade silhouetted against a glowing yellow sky as firefighters trained their hoses on the engulfed structure.After the big flames died down Thursday, the house was one of many smoking casualties marked off with yellow tape. In another driveway, a burned-out car rested on its rims. The steep surrounding hillsides were blackened and stripped of vegetation.Many other homes appeared unscathed and palm trees that had survived the onslaught of embers swayed above in calmer winds.Two firefighters were hospitalized but no other injuries were reported.The fire’s cause was under investigation and damage inspections were still ongoing on Thursday, Orange County Fire Authority Assistant Chief T.J. McGovern said. Southern California Edison reported that unspecified electrical “circuit activity” occurred around the time the fire broke out late Wednesday afternoon.Electric utility equipment has repeatedly been linked to starting some of the most disastrous California wildfires, especially during windy weather.The state Public Utilities Commission last year approved a settlement of more than half a billion dollars in fines and penalties for SoCal Edison for its role in five wildfires in 2017 and 2018.In New Mexico, another red-flag warning was expected to end by Friday night for the first time in a week but extremely low humidity and bone-dry fuels will continue to provide ample opportunity for flames to spread, officials said.“This fire is going to continue to grow,” Bales, the incident commander, warned Thursday night.Residents in four counties east and northeast of Santa Fe remained under a variety of evacuation orders and alerts, and fire officials expected the blaze to continue on a northeast path east of Taos through less-populated areas about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of the Colorado line.With strong spring winds tossing embers into unburned territory, the fire has grown tens of square miles daily since starting April 6 when a prescribed burn intended to clear out brush and small trees — to prevent future fires — got out of control. That fire merged with another wildfire several weeks later.The blaze has burned more than 170 homes so far, but authorities have said that number is expected to increase significantly as more assessments are done and residents are allowed to return home to areas deemed safe.The New Mexico fire has burned through mostly rural areas that include a mix of scattered ranch homes, historic Hispanic villages that date back centuries and high-dollar summer cabins. Some of the ranching and farming families who have called the area home for generations have spoken at length about the sacredness of the landscape, while many others have been too brokenhearted to express what they have lost.___Melley reported from Los Angeles.

(AP) — A pair of University of Michigan researchers are putting the “pee” in peony.Rather, they’re putting pee ON peonies.Environmental engineering professors Nancy Love and Krista Wigginton are regular visitors to the Ann Arbor school’s Nichols Arboretum, where they have been applying urine-based fertilizer to the heirloom peony beds ahead of the flowers’ annual spring bloom.It’s all part of an effort to educate the public about their research showing that applying fertilizer derived from nutrient-rich urine could have environmental and economic benefits.“At first, we thought people might be hesitant. You know, this might be weird. But we’ve really experienced very little of that attitude,” Wigginton said. “In general, people think it’s funny at first, but then they understand why we’re doing it and they support it.”Love is co-author of a study published in the Environmental Science & Technology journal that found urine diversion and recycling led to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy.Urine contains essential nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus and has been used as a crop fertilizer for thousands of years.Love said collecting human urine and using it to create renewable fertilizers — as part of what she calls the “circular economy of nutrients” — will lead to greater environmental sustainability.Think of it not so much as recycling, but “pee-cycling,” Wigginton said.“We were looking for terms that would catch on but get the idea across, and ‘pee-cycling’ seems to be one that stuck,” she said.As part of a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation awarded in 2016, Love and Wigginton have not only been testing advanced urine-treatment methods, but also investigating people’s attitudes about the use of urine-derived fertilizers.That is what brought them to the much-loved campus Peony Garden, which contains more than 270 historic cultivated varieties from the 19th and early 20th centuries representing American, Canadian and European peonies of the era. The garden holds nearly 800 peonies when filled and up to 10,000 flowers at peak bloom.Love and Wigginton plan to spend weekends in May and June chatting up visitors. One important lesson they learned is about the precision of language.“We have used the term, ‘pee on the peonies.’ And then it grabs people’s attention and then we can talk to them about nutrient flows and nutrient efficiency in our communities and how to be more sustainable,” Love said. “It turns out some people thought that that was permission to drop their drawers and pee on the peonies.“So, this year, we’re going to use ‘pee for the peonies’ and hope that we don’t have that confusion.”The urine-derived fertilizer the researchers are using these days originated in Vermont. But if all goes according to plan, they’ll be doling out some locally sourced fertilizer next year.A split-bowl toilet in a campus engineering building is designed to send solid waste to a treatment plant while routing urine to a holding tank downstairs. Urine diverted from the toilet and urinal were to be treated and eventually used to create fertilizers, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the school to shut down the collection efforts.In the meantime, the facility is undergoing an upgrade to its freeze concentrator and adding a new, more energy-efficient pasteurizer, both developed by the Vermont-based Rich Earth Institute.“The whole idea is cycling within a community, so moving toward that we want to take urine from this community and apply it within this community,” Wigginton said."}, {"title": "Scientists Grow Plants In Lunar Soil For First Time Ever", "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — For the first time, scientists have grown plants in soil from the moon collected by NASA’s Apollo astronauts.Researchers had no idea if anything would sprout in the harsh moon dirt and wanted to see if it could be used to grow food by the next generation of lunar explorers. The results stunned them.“Holy cow. Plants actually grow in lunar stuff. Are you kidding me?” said Robert Ferl of the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.Ferl and his colleagues planted thale cress in moon soil returned by Apollo 11′s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and other moonwalkers. The good news: All of the seeds sprouted.The downside was that after the first week, the coarseness and other properties of the lunar soil stressed the small, flowering weeds so much that they grew more slowly than seedlings planted in fake moon dirt from Earth. Most of the moon plants ended up stunted.Results were published Thursday in Communications Biology.The longer the soil was exposed to punishing cosmic radiation and solar wind on the moon, the worse the plants seemed to do. The Apollo 11 samples — exposed a couple billion years longer to the elements because of the Sea of Tranquility’s older surface — were the least conducive for growth, according to scientists.“This is a big step forward to know that you can grow plants,” said Simon Gilroy, a space plant biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who had no role in the study. “The real next step is to go and do it on the surface of the moon.”Moon dirt is full of tiny, glass fragments from micrometeorite impacts that got everywhere in the Apollo lunar landers and wore down the moonwalkers’ spacesuits.One solution might be to use younger geologic spots on the moon, like lava flows, for digging up planting soil. The environment also could be tweaked, altering the nutrient mixture or adjusting the artificial lighting,Only 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil were brought back by six Apollo crews. Some of the earliest moon dust was sprinkled on plants under quarantine with the Apollo astronauts in Houston after returning from the moon.Most of the lunar stash remained locked away, forcing researchers to experiment with simulated soil made of volcanic ash on Earth. NASA finally doled out 12 grams to the University of Florida researchers early last year, and the long-awaited planting took place last May in a lab.NASA said the timing for such an experiment was finally right, with the space agency looking to put astronauts back on the moon in a few years.The ideal situation would be for future astronauts to tap into the endless supply of available local dirt for indoor planting versus setting up a hydroponic, or all-water, system, scientists said.“The fact that anything grew means that we have a really good starting point, and now the question is how do we optimize and improve,” said Sharmila Bhattacharya, NASA’s program scientist for space biology,The Florida scientists hope to recycle their lunar soil later this year, planting more thale cress before possibly moving on to other vegetation.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Researchers monitored 719 reefs along the eastern coast of Australia, saying 654 of those showed signs of at least some bleaching. Many of those were classified as severely or extremely bleached.“The Great Barrier Reef’s waters warmed early in December 2021, exceeding historical summer maximums that typically occur in the hottest summer months,” the agency said in a release this week. “This prolonged heat exposure led to a mass bleaching of coral across the Great Barrier Reef; the fourth to occur in seven years. Unusually, this was the first mass bleaching event to occur under La Niña conditions.”The marine park authority said Tuesday that scientists had observed some severe bleaching along some surveyed sights, including “completely white colonies” and coral death in areas hit hardest by the warm oceans.The marine park authority first said in March that the iconic structure was undergoing another devastating mass bleaching event, the fourth since 2016, due to abnormally warm ocean temperatures. It’s the first time, however, that a mass bleaching has happened during a La Niña year, when the ocean is supposed to be cooler than usual.Bleaching happens most often when corals are effectively cooked by warmer than usual water, which causes the delicate polyps to turn a sickly white. They can recover if temperatures stabilize, but if the warm water lingers for too long, huge swaths of the reef can die.The report was quietly published Tuesday night, a week after The Sydney Morning Herald reported the document had been delayed until after Australia’s federal election. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority maintained at the time the decision had nothing to do with politics, although scientists and environmentalists criticized the agency for not publishing the findings sooner.The agency’s chief scientist, David Wachenfeld, said there was hope the bleaching wouldn’t lead to widespread death of corals.“The early indications are the mortality won’t be very high so we are hoping that we will see most of the coral that is bleached recover, and we will end up with an event rather more like 2020 where yes there was mass bleaching but there was low mortality,” Wachenfeld told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.But reef advocates have stressed that any mass bleaching event is devastating news.“This was a La Niña year, normally characterized by more cloud cover and rain,” Lissa Schindler, a campaign manger for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told The Guardian. “It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover … This is not normal and we should not accept that this is the way things are.”Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced fierce criticism for failing to address climate change, instead throwing his support behind the coal and mining industries. The country has pledged to spend more than $2 billion to protect the structure, but advocates say that figure fails to address the root cause of its demise: our rapidly warming world.Scientists had hoped the season would give corals walloped by frequent bleaching time to recover, but they said the latest event was a “grim” sign for the future of the reef. Instead, some warned that the next strong El Niño summer — when waters are hotter than usual — would be “awful” for the reef."}, {"title": "Great Barrier Reef Condition Now 'Very Poor'", "text": ""}, {"title": "Dog Rescued From Cage Thrown Into River Finds New Home: 'He Still Loves People'", "text": "A young Michigan dog with a resilient spirit has found a new home after being rescued from a perilous situation.VanBuren, a puppy estimated to be 5 to 6 months old, was picked up by animal control after someone found him “locked in a black wire crate in a river,” Jackson County Animal Shelter spokesperson Lydia Sattler told HuffPost in an email.VanBuren was taken to the shelter, which wrote about his plight last week in a Facebook post that went viral.

Gavin Newsom and other authorities, state officials announced Tuesday.Water usage jumped nearly 19% in March, which was one of the driest months on record. Newsom last summer asked residents to voluntarily cut water use by 15%. He encouraged people to water their yards less often, run dishwashers less and install more efficient appliances.The state’s conservation rate gradually increased, aided by some intense fall and early winter storms that reduced water demand. But the first three months of 2022 have been some of the driest ever recorded. Water use increased slightly in January and February before exploding in March when compared to 2020 figures.Since July, the state has cut its overall water use by just 3.7%.Newsom responded to the news by pledging to spend an extra $26 million on water conservation programs, in addition to the $190 million he proposed in January. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced residents and businesses would have to reduce outdoor landscape watering from three days per week to two. Irrigation makes up 35% of the city’s water use.A series of April storms have improved things slightly since March. Still, most of the state’s reservoirs are well below their historic averages.

A big one is habitat loss caused by climate change, as rising sea levels swallow up the low-lying landmasses where the seals live.Other dangers include getting tangled up in fishing nets and other marine debris, eating harmful trash like fishing hooks, diseases, disturbances from human activity on beaches, and even some people intentionally killing them.“We are out there ourselves and working with partners to conduct life-saving interventions for seals, prioritizing females, which are going to go on to create the future generation of seals,” Barbieri told the AP. “We’re starting to really see that continued payoff of intervening to save animals’ lives.”In the Hawaiian language, monk seals are called ilio-holo-i-ka-uaua, which translates to “dog running in the rough water.” The marine mammals can grow between 6 and 7 feet long and weigh 400-600 pounds, feeding on a wide array of fish, octopus, squid, crustaceans and eels. On occasion, those eels cause their own kind of trouble, sometimes getting stuck in seals’ noses.

It has deep connections to Trumpworld and has joined a growing coalition of right-wing organizations and elected officials sowing fear in rural communities with false, conspiratorial claims about how Biden’s government is planning to confiscate private property or use deceptive tactics to gain control of private land to meet the 30x30 target.On its cowboy-heavy website, Sagebrush Rebellion boasts of being “made up of grassroots fighters who are not beholden to Washington’s inner circles” and says it is “committed to gutting incompetent and corrupt leaders from the political process.” Its priorities include dismantling federal land management agencies and transferring control of federal lands to the states, as well as a laundry list of fossil fuel-centric energy policies that looks like something pulled directly from an oil and gas trade group’s website.The PAC’s donations page urges people to “help us start a rebellion.” It sells T-shirts, mugs and other merchandise that feature a cow skull and the phrase “Let’s Go Brandin’,” a cowboy twist on a popular conservative phrase meaning “Fuck Joe Biden.” Internet archives show that in 2015 the website URL that Sagebrush Rebellion PAC is now using featured a post titled “Simple Wisdom of Cliven Bundy,” the notorious Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff with federal agents in 2014 over unpaid grazing fees.As HuffPost reported this story, the PAC and a film company it is working with on a documentary purged their social media accounts of specific posts in the exact order that HuffPost inquired about them.As of March 31, the fledgling PAC had received only $200 in contributions, according to its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. But it recently started forging relationships with some of the biggest players in the anti-30x30 push. The PAC sponsored last month’s “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska. On Twitter, the group has parroted the anti-30x30 movement’s sweeping, evidence-free claim that the 30x30 target is a federal “land grab” in disguise.The group is based in Casper, Wyoming, and led by Rockefeller heiress and Donald Trump loyalist Catharine P. O’Neill, the daughter of major Republican donor George O’Neill Jr. She worked at both the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration and is a regular contributor to far-right news outlet Newsmax.Christian Whiton, a former adviser to the Trump and George W. Bush administrations, is the PAC’s ​​director of communications.O’Neill and Whiton have both peddled baseless claims about fraud in the 2020 election and questioned the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency. On a leaked call with USAID staff two days after Biden was announced the winner, O’Neill declared that “the election is still happening” and “the Electoral College has not voted yet.” And on Jan. 6, 2021, after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to thwart certification of the 2020 election, O’Neill went on Twitter to proclaim her alliance to Trump and condemn those not standing behind him.Along with sponsoring last month’s “Stop 30x30 Summit,” Sagebrush Rebellion PAC has teamed up with an Arizona-based production company, J Infinite Digital Media, to produce some sort of documentary starring the leading figures of the anti-30x30 movement.In a now-deleted post on Instagram, J Infinite shared pictures of the production company and Sagebrush Rebellion PAC filming at last month’s event. “An amazing production day with @sagebrushrebellion on their latest doc project,” read the post, which included pictures of film production and an interview with Margaret Byfield, executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, a fringe right-wing property rights group in Texas that organized the summit and is leading the fight against 30x30. Jackson Carter of Sagebrush Rebellion was tagged in the post.The post also featured Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), one of the summit’s keynote speakers, and Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman (R), who was convicted in 2015 of leading anti-federal land protesters on an illegal ATV ride on public lands that were off limits to off-road vehicles. Trump later pardoned Lyman’s federal misdemeanor conviction.J Infinite removed the Instagram post within a couple hours of HuffPost contacting Sagebrush Rebellion PAC about it.Accountable.US, a watchdog group, first alerted HuffPost to Sagebrush Rebellion PAC and its forthcoming documentary project.“When it comes to American Stewards of Liberty, you can almost hear the black helicopters circling,” Jordan Schreiber, energy and environment director at Accountable.US, told HuffPost in an email. She noted that the group’s leaders have compared 30x30 to Nazi Germany and the Holodomor, a human-caused famine that occurred in Ukraine during Soviet dictator Josef Stalin’s rule that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 3.9 million people.“This is what we are up against in the fight to preserve American land and water for future generations to enjoy,” Schreiber said.The documentary project appears to be far and away the biggest job this little-known film outfit has landed. A review of J Infinite’s website indicates its specialty is filming and photographing people shooting and posing with guns. Two of its main clients are tactical training facilities in Arizona, one of which J Infinite’s owner Jacob Fuchs also works for.Fuchs seems to have some sort of affiliation with or affinity for the Boogaloo Bois, an often violent far-right, anti-government movement that has warned of and even plotted a future civil war. Members often sport Hawaiian shirts and military-style gear.Last June, J Infinite released a nearly three-minute, slow-motion video titled “Da Bois,” featuring Fuchs and two other men in tactical gear shooting assault-style rifles and handguns and fist-bumping to The Chords’ song “Sh-Boom.” Vests worn by Fuchs and another man feature patches that read “BOOG CREW.” Another similar video posted on the company’s YouTube channel is titled “Boogaloo Crew Pilot.”Two days after the anti-30x30 summit in Nebraska, Sagebrush Rebellion posted a picture on Twitter of what appears to be Fuchs in a Hawaiian shirt with the caption, “Behind the scenes…stay tuned!”Neither J Infinite nor Sagebrush Rebellion PAC responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment about the documentary they are working on or the production company’s Boogaloo-themed videos.A series of emails to Joshua Abernathy, whose address is listed on the PAC’s filings with the FEC, garnered only a brief reply: “I am no longer working on that project.”After HuffPost reached out to J Infinite, the company deleted its Boogaloo-themed content from YouTube, took down its website and made its Instagram page private. And immediately after HuffPost asked if the man pictured in the Hawaiian shirt was Fuchs, Sagebrush Rebellion took down the post and blocked this reporter on Twitter.It is unclear how Fuchs and his company went from filming Boogaloo-themed target practices to a documentary for a PAC run by former Trump administration officials, or to what extent American Stewards of Liberty is involved in the project.Byfield did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.American Stewards is largely responsible for the false narrative about 30x30 being a government land grab. The organization was formed in 2009, but it has its roots in the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement. One of its precursors, Stewards of the Range, was established in 1992 to defend Byfield’s father, Nevada rancher and sagebrush rebel Wayne Hage, who battled with the Forest Service for years over unpermitted grazing on public lands — a prequel of sorts to the Bundy standoff that gave rise to an extremist militia movement.Byfield has worked to distance her organization from the Sagebrush Rebellion and the Bundy family. In a June 2021 email to a Nebraska reporter, which HuffPost obtained as part of a public records request, Byfield wrote that her group “was founded in the 1990s so we couldn’t have had an association with the sagebrush rebellion” and that her father “was not part of the sagebrush rebellion.” She also said American Stewards has never been associated with Bundy.Yet Byfield allowed a PAC named after the Sagebrush Rebellion that shares the movement’s anti-federal land ideology to sponsor and film an anti-30x30 summit that she called “the most important conference” her group has ever organized.And Trent Loos, a Nebraska rancher and radio show host who served on Trump’s agricultural advisory committee and now helps American Stewards with its anti-30x30 campaign, conducted a sympathetic interview with Bundy’s son, Ammon Bundy, during the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016.In closing remarks at last month’s summit in Nebraska, which HuffPost obtained a recording of, Byfield took a moment to thank and recognize the event’s sponsors.“Catharine O’Neill, the Sagebrush Rebellion,” Byfield said to the audience. “Have you guys been doing any interviews with Catharine? She’s set up in the media room.”"}, {"title": "Ukraine's Scientists Keep Working In Defiance Of Russian Invasion", "text": "Anton Vlaschenko often hears shelling outside his office in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, not far from the front lines of the war. He sometimes even sees smoke rising from Russian tanks hit by missiles.But the 40-year-old zoologist continues his work, dissecting and labeling bat tissue, as he probes the disease ecology of the flying mammals. When news of the war overwhelms him, he says, it helps to have something familiar to do with his hands.He also sees it as an act of defiance.“Our staying in Ukraine, our continuing to work — it’s some kind of resistance of Russian invasion,” Vlaschenko said via Zoom, a barrage of shelling audible in the background. “The people together in Ukraine are ready to fight, not only with guns. We don’t want to lose our country.”His resolve isn’t unique. Like other Ukrainians whose labors aren’t essential to the war effort, the scientists and academics want to continue their important work where they can.A common refrain is that they want to stay connected to their scholarly community, which provides a shard of normalcy amid the chaos and violence, and “keep the light of Ukrainian science and humanities alive,” said Yevheniia Polishchuk, who teaches at Kyiv National Economic University.As vice chair of the Young Scientists Council at Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science, Polishchuk organized an online survey of academics to assess their situation and needs after the Feb. 24 invasion. An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 scholars had left Ukraine by early April — mostly women with families — but about 100,000 stayed.Most who went abroad wound up in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, getting temporary positions at European institutions. Some scientists have received grants from the Polish Academy of Sciences, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and other organizations. Polishchuk, now in Krakow with her children and husband, is a visiting professor at a university for May and June but says she hopes to return to Kyiv when fighting stops.“We don’t want the war to result in a brain drain from Ukraine,” she said.While Ukrainian scholars are appealing to international scientific bodies for assistance — including remote work opportunities and access to journals, datasets, archives and other materials — there is also a will to prevent the war from permanently sapping talent and momentum from the country’s academic and professional ranks, which will be needed to rebuild after fighting stops.“Most of our scholars do not want to move abroad permanently; they want to stay in Ukraine,” Polishchuk said.Shortly after the war began, Ivan Slyusarev, a 34-year-old astronomer, helped the director of Kharkiv National University’s observatory move computers, monitors and other materials into the basement, which had sheltered equipment and historical artifacts when Nazi forces occupied the city during World War II.The observatory’s main telescope is located in a field in Russia-occupied territory, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Kharkiv on the road to Donetsk. Slyusarev said he doesn’t know its condition, but thinks Ukrainian forces blew up a nearby bridge to stop the Russian advance.He is relying on scientists outside Ukraine to continue his work. Astronomers in the Czech Republic have sent him observational data from their telescope so he can keep analyzing the properties of metallic asteroids. He also can see data from a small robotic telescope in Spain’s Canary Islands. He operates mostly from a home office on the outskirts of Kharkiv.Slyusarev, who says he became an astronomer because of “romantic” ideas about the stars, finds refuge in scientific discovery. Astronomy “produces only positive news” and is a welcome respite from daily life, he said.“It’s very important in wartime,” he added.After the war started, theoretical physicist and astronomer Oleksiy Golubov left Kharkiv to join his parents in Batkiv, a village in western Ukraine.Although the buildings of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology were “bombed and shelled and virtually destroyed,” Golubov said, the school continues to offer some remote classes. He has been keeping in touch with students online — in Kharkiv, in western Ukraine and in Poland and Germany.The 36-year-old scientist is also a coordinator and trainer for the Ukrainian students preparing to compete in the International Physicists Tournament, a competition for tackling unsolved physics problems that is being held in Colombia this month. The students, who had been training online, met this week in Lviv for the first time — following train journeys delayed by the war.“We still want to take part and prove that even inconveniences like war can’t stop us from doing good science and having a good education,” he said.Golubov, who was turned down from joining the military because of a paralyzed hand, submitted a paper in March to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics and wrote in the acknowledgements, “We are grateful to Ukrainians who are fighting to stop the war so that we can safely finish the revision of this article.”Some scholars, like Ivan Patrilyak, dean of the history department at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, have enlisted. Eighteen months ago, he was hosting a speaker series on the legacy of World War II and lecturing about the Holocaust. Now, he’s with a territorial defense unit in Kyiv.Igor Lyman, a historian at the State Pedagogical University in Berdyansk, had to flee when Russian forces occupied the port city early in the war. Before leaving, he had seen the troops break into dormitories to interrogate students and order administrators to teach in Russian, rather than Ukrainian, and use a Moscow-approved curriculum. He said the directors “refused and resigned.”He later settled in a camp for internally displaced persons at Chernivtsi National University, living in a dormitory with academics from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson and other cities.“Each of these families has its own terrible story of war,” he wrote in an email. “And everyone, like me, dreams of our victory and coming back home.”He said the Russian forces “are doing everything they can to impose their propaganda.”Vlaschenko, the Kharkiv zoologist, wanted to protect 20 bats in his care from the shelling, so he carried them to his home, a walk of about an hour. It also helped to preserve his valuable research, which couldn’t be easily replaced, even if buildings and labs can be rebuilt after the war.“All the people who decided to stay in Kharkiv agreed to play this dangerous and potentially deadly lottery,” he said, “because you never know in what areas a new rocket or new shell would hit.”As he scrambles to record data and safeguard his rare samples, he sees it as part of his mission — “not only for us, but also for science in general.”The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Engelhart waited with Baby Girl in case someone came back for her, but ultimately brought her to the WHS’ Green Bay shelter.Baby Girl’s story has been getting attention not only for the heartbreaking photo, which went viral, but because of a moving Facebook post from the animal rescue organization.The post begins by updating the public on Baby Girl, saying she is “doing great” in the shelter’s care.“As her story gains attention locally and beyond, we wanted to take a moment to address Baby Girl’s previous owner directly,” the post reads.“First and foremost, we are so sorry you had to part with your best friend,” it continues. “It’s evident just how much you loved her and we can see you did your best while struggling with your own medical complications and challenges of life.”The shelter lists the reasons why it seems clear that Baby Girl’s former owner was trying to do what they felt was best for their beloved dog.“We see your love in the bag you carefully packed with all of her favorite things,” the shelter’s post reads. “We see your love in the way you secured her leash so she wouldn’t get hit by a car. We see your love in the way you placed her in the middle of a neighborhood where she’d be quickly found. We see your love in how happy and healthy Baby Girl looks. And we see your love in the note you left, pleading for someone to help her when you no longer could.”That said, the WHS urged people who can no longer care for pets to bring them to a shelter rather than leave them outside.“You will be met at the door with the same compassion and respect that we bring to animals in our care,” Speed said. “We never want anyone to hesitate to seek our services.”Engelhart told HuffPost she has “no ill will” toward Baby Girl’s former owner, and that she wants “everyone to focus on the love for Baby Girl and finding her a new loving home she can thrive in!”That likely won’t be difficult for Baby Girl, who’s about 6 years old and “affectionate and delightful,” according to Speed.“She’s a happy girl who loves to go for walks, play with toys, and gets super excited to perform a perfect ‘sit’ for treats,” Speed said.Baby Girl will likely be up for adoption in “the coming days” after she clears some additional veterinary checks. In the meantime, the shelter hopes her former owner sees the Facebook post and knows their dog is in good hands.“We wish you all the best and hope that if you see this, you can rest a little easier knowing your Baby Girl has a bright future ahead,” the Facebook post reads."}, {"title": "A Whole Lot Of Dams In The United States Are At Risk Of Failing", "text": "Constructed four generations ago, the massive rock and clay dam at El Capitan Reservoir is capable of storing over 36 billion gallons of water, enough to supply every resident in San Diego for most of a year.Today, it’s three-quarters empty, intentionally kept low because of concerns it could fail under the strain of too much water.During “a big earthquake, you never know what’s going to happen, if this is going to hold,” said Samuel Santos, a longtime resident who frequently fishes near the dam.Seismic instability and a spillway in need of “significant repair” led El Capitan to be added to a growing list of dams rated in poor condition or worse that would likely cause deaths downstream if they failed.An Associated Press analysis tallied more than 2,200 high-hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition across the U.S. — up substantially from a similar AP review conducted three years ago. The actual number is likely even higher, although it’s unclear because some states don’t track such data and many federal agencies refuse to release details about their dams’ conditions.The nation’s dams are on average over a half-century old and often present more of a hazard than envisioned when designed because homes, businesses or highways have cropped up below them. Meanwhile, a warming atmosphere can bring stronger storms  with heavier rainfall that could overwhelm aging dams.“All of a sudden, you’ve got older dams with a lower design criteria that now can potentially cause loss of life if they fail,” said Del Shannon, an engineer who is president of the U.S. Society on Dams.“The number of deficient, high-hazard dams is increasing,” he said, adding that without investment in upgrades, that number will continue to rise.Decades of deferred maintenance has worsened the problem. But a changing climate and extreme floods — such as the one that caused the failure of two Michigan dams  and the evacuation of 10,000 people in 2020 — have brought a renewed focus to an often overlooked aspect of America’s critical infrastructure.The $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed last year by President Joe Biden will pump about $3 billion into dam-related projects, including hundreds of millions for state dam safety programs and repairs.It marks “a tremendous leap and jump of funding,” said Kayed Lakhia, director of the National Dam Safety Program at the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Yet it’s still just a fraction of the nearly $76 billion needed to fix the almost 89,000 dams owned by individuals, companies, community associations, state and local governments, and other entities besides the federal government,  according to a report by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials.___The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lists about 92,000 dams in its nationwide database, most of which are privately owned and regulated by states. Dams are classified according to the risk posed by failure, ranging from low to significant to high. A high hazard means lives could be lost if the dam fails.Dams also are assessed by their condition. Those in the worst shape — categorized as poor or unsatisfactory — can have a variety of problems including cracks and erosion that could undermine a dam, or spillway outlets unable to release all the water after extraordinary rainfall.The number of high-hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition has risen partly because of stricter regulation. Some state programs, infused with millions of additional dollars, have stepped up inspections, reassessed whether old dams endanger new downstream developments and worked to identify dams long ago abandoned by their owners. Some also are updating the precipitation tools used to evaluate the risks.New York has about twice the number of high-hazard dams in poor condition as it did in 2018, when the AP collected data for its earlier analysis. The increase came as officials pushed to assess all high-hazard dams that were previously unrated.The number of high-hazard dams in deficient condition in South Carolina rose by a third from 2018 to 2021, after lawmakers more than doubled annual funding for the state’s dam safety program. More than 70 dams failed in the state amid heavy rains in 2015  and 2016. Since then, South Carolina has ramped up staffing, undertaken more regular inspections and begun mapping potential flood zones for low-hazard dams to determine if they should be reclassified as high hazard.“When you had a storm of that magnitude and you have it happen again the next year, and dams continue to fail, we’ve got to be able to provide a response,” said Jill Stewart, the state’s director of dam safety and stormwater permitting.Rhode Island examined the capacity of all its dam spillways after five dams failed during a storm in 2010. A 2019 study found that a quarter of its high-hazard dams couldn’t hold up to a 100-year storm — an event with a 1% chance of happening any year — and 17% couldn’t pass a 500-year storm, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in a year.The state was sharing the findings with dam owners and could require some to upgrade their spillways to meet state regulations.Many old dams “are undersized for the kind of storms that we’re getting today and will be getting in the future,” said David Chopy, administrator of the Office of Compliance and Inspection at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.Since 2019, California regulators have downgraded four of San Diego’s water supply dams from fair to poor condition because of deterioration and concerns they could fail because of an earthquake or extraordinary rainfall. As a result, the high-hazard dams at El Capitan, Hodges and Morena reservoirs all are restricted to holding less than half their capacities. The dam at Lower Otay Reservoir, also high hazard and in poor condition, is not restricted.The lower water means Santos, who has been coming to El Capitan Reservoir since childhood, can’t find relief from shade trees when he fishes from the receding banks. His children don’t want to join him because it’s so hot.“It’s sad to see it, because it’s just like a duck pond compared to what it used to be,” said another longtime resident, Bob Neal, who said his father-in-law helped build the dam in the 1930s.The dam’s poor condition also means less water is stored to prepare for drought, which has become particularly severe in the West. San Diego gets an average of just 10 inches of rain annually.“These reservoirs are very important,” said Republican state Sen. Brian Jones, whose district includes the El Capitan and Lake Hodges dams. “We need to start spending the money on them to retrofit them, to get them up again back to full capacity.”Jones is among several lawmakers pushing the state to carry out a 2014 ballot proposition that authorized billions of dollars for reservoir projects. San Diego’s mayor also has urged the state to allot at least $3 billion for dam repairs statewide.___For many dams, problems develop gradually and risks can be reduced by temporary measures, such as lowering water levels, until repairs can be made, said Ryan Stack, chief engineer at Missouri’s dam safety program.“Unsatisfactory doesn’t necessarily mean helicopters and bells-and-whistles and everything going off for an immediate crisis,” Stack said.But the risk from old, inadequate dams has become painfully evident in recent years.In 2019, a rural Nebraska dam failed under extreme pressure from a raging flood of ice chunks, killing a man whose home was beneath the dam. An independent investigation determined that state regulators should have classified the dam as “high hazard,” which could have led to a plan to increase its flood capacity and better warn residents downstream. The public utility that owned the dam agreed this year to a $2.5 million settlement for the man’s family while a lawsuit continues against the state.In 2020, central Michigan’s Edenville Dam failed following heavy rainfall. The rupture unleashed a torrent on the Tittabawassee River, leading to the failure of Sanford Dam downstream and the evacuation of about 10,000 people.The high-hazard Edenville Dam, built in 1924, had been rated in unsatisfactory condition in 2018 and lost its federal hydropower license due to a variety of issues, including a spillway incapable of standing up to a severe flood.An investigatory report released Wednesday found that Edenville dam had deficiencies with its earthen embankment that could have been been caught and corrected if engineers had gone beyond visual inspections and conducted a more comprehensive review of the dam’s design and construction. Regulators across the country should learn from the Michigan failures, said John France, an engineer who led the investigation.“No one has X-ray eyes,” France said Thursday. “You would have to look at the records, you would have to look at the test borings that were done and assimilate that all together.”After the dam failures, Michigan beefed up its 2022 budget with $19 million for dam safety, plus money to hire more regulatory staff. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently signed legislation providing an additional $250 million for dams, including about $200 million to repair those damaged by the 2020 floods.The plan prioritizes high-risk dams “that can be ticking time bombs if they are not addressed,” said state Rep. Roger Hauck, a Republican whose district experienced flooding from the dam failures. “Dragging our feet or failing to get it done will only open the door to other catastrophes down the line.”Other states also are pumping more money into dam safety. After Kansas exempted thousands of dams from state regulation in 2013, its allotment of annual federal dam safety funds plunged, leading to a decline in staffing and delays in handling permits and inspections. A budget passed by the Legislature this year will double state funding and staff for the dam safety office.Facing a projected 20-year backlog of work, Missouri lawmakers last year added $75,000 to hire an additional dam safety engineer. But it’s taken 10 months to find someone qualified to fill the position.Addressing the problems posed by old, unsafe dams can be challenging. Repairs can be costly and take years to complete. Attempts to remove dams — and empty the lakes they hold back — can spawn legal battles and a public outcry from those who rely on them for recreation or to sustain nearby property values.A pair of high-hazard dams built in the mid-1800s near Cleveland are among those in need of major repair. Upper Shaker Lake, commonly known as Horseshoe Lake, was drained as a precaution after it developed sinkholes and cracks. The cities of Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights, which jointly manage the dams, last year approved a $28.3 million plan to remove Horseshoe Lake Dam, return the area to a free-flowing stream and rebuild Lower Shaker Lake Dam.But the plan faces backlash from community members who formed a nonprofit to try to save Horseshoe Lake. They hired a law firm and engineering company, launched a fundraising drive and gathered about 2,000 online petition signatures.“The lake is a beautiful, calming feature that is the central park of the Heights neighborhood,” said musician Bert Stratton, a resident helping to lead the efforts. “It’s where people come to congregate, and they have for over 100 years.”The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, which manages stormwater projects, said Horseshoe Lake provides little flood-control benefit and that the district won’t pay to rebuild it.“People need to understand there is a major risk at this facility,” including the “probable loss of life if the dam blew out,” said Frank Greenland, the district’s director of watershed programs.Decades of procrastination on repairs has led to the deterioration of other dams across the country. Some owners find it difficult to justify the costs of improving structures without facing an emergency.There’s an attitude among some dam owners of “oh, we’ll take care of it next year; oh, we’ll take care of it in three years; oh, let’s put together a plan,” said Bob Travis, managing partner of Risk Management Matters LLC, a consultant for community associations. “Meanwhile, that dam is getting older and older and older.”___Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri; Casey from Boston; and Minkoff from Washington, D.C.

(AP) — Firefighters slowed the advance of the largest wildfire in the U.S. as heavy winds relented Wednesday, while President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration that brings new financial resources to remote stretches of New Mexico devastated by fire since early April.U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez announced the presidential disaster declaration during an evening briefing by the U.S. Forest Service about efforts to contain the sprawling wildfire in northeastern New Mexico. It has fanned out across 258 square miles (669 square kilometers) of high alpine forest and grasslands at the southern tip of the Rocky Mountains.“It will help us do that rebuilding and it will help us with the expenses and the hardship that people are facing right now,” the congresswoman said. “We’re glad it happened this quickly.”Fire bosses are seizing upon an interlude of relatively calm and cool weather to prevent the fire from pushing any closer to the small New Mexico city of Las Vegas and other villages scattered along the fire’s shifting fronts. Airplanes and helicopters dropped slurries of red fire retardant from the sky, as ground crews cleared timber and brush to starve the fire along crucial fronts.Bulldozers for days scraped fire lines on the outskirts of Las Vegas, population 13,000, while crews have conducted controlled burning to clear adjacent vegetation to prevent it from igniting. Aircraft dropped more fire retardant as a second line of defense along a ridge just west of Las Vegas in preparation for intense winds expected over the weekend.Strong winds with gusts up to 45 mph (72 kph) are expected to return Saturday afternoon along with above-normal temperatures and “abysmally low” humidity that make for extreme fire danger, said Todd Shoemake, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Albuquerque. “Sunday and Monday are probably looking to be even worse.”Nearly 1,300 firefighters and other personnel were assigned to the fire.Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for an estimated 15,500 homes in outlying areas and in the valleys of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains that border Las Vegas. The tally of homes destroyed by the fire stands around 170 but could grow higher because officials have not been able to conduct assessment in all of the burn zones.Biden’s disaster declaration releases emergency funds to recovery efforts in three counties in northeastern New Mexico where fires are still raging and for southern New Mexico areas where wind-driven blazes killed two people and destroyed over 200 homes in mid-April.The aid includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other relief programs for people and businesses, a White House statement said.Local law enforcement officials acknowledged the physical and emotion toll of the prolonged evacuations. Las Vegas Police Chief Antonio Salazar said his officers would provide “burglary patrols” for evacuated areas and help to maintain order at a local Walmart as people line up to purchase supplies.“Repopulation, that’s one thing we’re very interested in,” San Miguel County Sheriff Chris Lopez said. “Everybody wants to get back home.”Dan Pearson, a fire behavior specialist with the federal government, said weather forecasters predict two days of relatively light winds before the return of strong spring gales.“Our prayers are working because we’ve had advantageous winds throughout the fire area today,” he said. “We’ll take advantage of this fact over the next few days. ... What we can do is build resilient pockets.”The fire was contained across just 20% of its perimeter. Its flames were about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away from Las Vegas, where schools were closed as residents braced for possible evacuation.Officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory were warily tracking another wildfire that crept within about 5 miles (8 kilometers) of facilities at the U.S. nuclear research complex.Fire crews worked to widen a road that stands between the fire and Los Alamos while clearing out underbrush and treating the area with fire retardant.Wildfires have become a year-round threat in the drought-stricken West — moving faster and burning hotter than ever due to climate change, scientists and fire experts have said. Fire officials also point to overgrown areas where vegetation can worsen wildfire conditions.___Montoya Bryan reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

(AP) — The endangered California condor returned to soar the skies over the state’s far northern coast redwood forests on Tuesday for the first time in more than a century.Two captive-bred birds were released from a pen in Redwood National Park, about an hour’s drive south of the Oregon border, under a project aimed at restoring the giant vultures to their historic habitat in the Pacific Northwest.The two male condors were moved into staging area at late morning and a remotely controlled gate was opened. After a few minutes of warily eyeing the opening, the birds stepped one by one through the opening, spread their giant wings and took off.“They just jumped up and took flight off into the distance,” Tiana Williams-Claussen, wildlife director for the region’s Yurok tribe, said in a webcast.Condors were last spotted in the park area around 1892, authorities said. The California condor is the largest native North American bird, with a wingspan of nearly 10 feet (3 meters). The scavenger was once widespread but had virtually disappeared by the 1970s because of poaching, lead poisoning from eating animals shot by hunters and destruction of its habitat.The birds can live for 60 years and fly vast distances in search of carrion, so their range could extend into several states.Federal and local fish and wildlife agencies are involved in the restoration project headed by the Yurok tribe, which traditionally has considered the California condor a sacred animal and has been working for years to return the species to the tribe’s ancestral territory.“For countless generations, the Yurok people have upheld a sacred responsibility to maintain balance in the natural world. Condor reintroduction is a real-life manifestation of our cultural commitment to restore and protect the planet for future generations,” tribal Chairman Joseph L. James said in a statement.Two more condors were set to be released later — after biologists determine that the two birds who took to the skies Tuesday have displayed appropriate behavior, authorities said.The condors, including one female and three males, are between 2 and 4 years old. Two were hatched at the Oregon Zoo and two at the Peregrine Fund’s World Center for Birds of Prey in Idaho.In the early 1980s, all 22 condors remaining in the wild were trapped and brought into a captive-breeding program that began releasing the giant vultures into Southern California’s Los Padres National Forest in 1992.That flock has been expanding its range while other condors now occupy parts of California’s Central Coast, Arizona, Utah and Baja California, Mexico. The total population now numbers more than 500 birds in captivity and in the wild.Two years ago, California condors were spotted in Sequoia National Park, in California’s Sierra Nevada, for the first time in nearly 50 years.However, that same year, a dozen adults and two chicks died when a wildfire set by an arsonist ravaged their territory on the Big Sur coast."}, {"title": "With Emissions Soaring, Democratic Governors Sour On Plans To Shut Down Nuclear Power", "text": "Virtually every place that shuts down nuclear plants — from San Diego to New York City, Germany to South Korea — replaces them with fossil fuels, swapping an abundant source of zero-emissions electricity for the very energy sources roasting the planet.But with gas prices and emissions on the rise, two governors are rethinking plans to shut down major nuclear power stations.With just weeks to go before the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station becomes the next U.S. plant to shutter, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) formally asked the Biden administration on April 20 for federal funding to keep the reactors running.On Friday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told the Los Angeles Times he also wanted federal money to keep Diablo Canyon, his state’s last remaining nuclear plant, open past its 2025 closure date.The announcements mark a shift in the politics of atomic power. At a time when planet-heating gas pollution is surging and efforts in Congress to cobble together a historic clean-energy spending plan have faced repeated setbacks, nuclear energy is becoming more appealing, even among Democrats whose party has historically championed closing down reactors.Nuclear energy is by far the most efficient and reliable electricity source humans have ever harnessed. Nuclear reactors produce power 24/7 on vastly less acreage than wind and solar, regardless of weather conditions. Atomic energy is also safer than fossil fuels, which not only cause global warming but lace the air with deadly, disease-causing particles.But connections to nuclear weapons and rare but catastrophic disasters like the meltdowns in Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 have long stoked opposition to reactors. Natural gas, made cheap by the U.S. drilling boom, gobbled up nuclear companies’ share of the electricity market, while state regulators have made increasingly challenging demands of plant operators, making it even harder to compete.There are some efforts to stave off shutdowns. Last September, Illinois approved nearly $700 million in new subsidies to keep the state’s nuclear fleet afloat in the decade ahead. In November, President Joe Biden signed into law the bipartisan infrastructure deal that established a $6 billion fund to bail out financially troubled reactors.But nuclear power in the U.S. is in trouble. Twelve nuclear reactors in the U.S. have closed permanently since 2012, and another seven are scheduled to shut down by 2025, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Together, they make up more than 7% of the country’s nuclear capacity.Money from the new fund to bail out reactors could make a practical difference in Michigan, where owner Entergy Nuclear has long operated the Palisades plant at a loss. The relatively modest-sized, single-reactor station on the east coast of Lake Michigan had struggled to find buyers for its electricity as more gas plants and wind turbines came online. In January, it won federal regulators’ approval to sell Palisades to Holtec International, a company that decommissions reactors.But an application from California for federal money to save its last remaining nuclear plant would mark more of a symbolic change in the Golden State.The state banned the construction of new nuclear reactors in 1976. But since the two reactors at Diablo Canyon, which were already under construction, came online in 1987, the plant profitably produced nearly one-tenth of California’s electricity from its isolated location near San Luis Obispo.Environmentalists campaigned to close the plant for decades before climate change became the defining issue in drought- and wildfire-prone California. Some feared Diablo Canyon, located near a volatile fault line, could set off a disaster in an earthquake. On the other side of the Pacific, an earthquake played a key role in triggering the accident that irradiated the area around the Fukushima-Daiichi plant 11 years ago.Other critics complained that the plant hurt aquatic animals because its system for cooling reactors with seawater spewed out warmed water that made the coastal area immediately near the plant less habitable for certain species.In 2016, when Newsom was the state’s lieutenant governor, he helped broker a deal between environmentalists, the reactor’s owner, Pacific Gas & Electric and the union representing its workers to shut the plant down. Under the agreement, its first reactor is set to come offline in 2024, with the second following the next year.But in the years that have followed that deal, the effects of climate change have become more visible and have taken a toll on the state’s electricity grid. Wildfires, some sparked by electrical equipment, caused rolling blackouts across the state. Hydroelectric dams that provided close to 13% of California’s power started facing shortages as drought dried reservoirs to new crisis levels. And the limited progress the power sector had made toward slashing emissions under the Obama administration’s climate regulations slowed after President Donald Trump took office and pushed to increase fossil fuel use.In 2020, California regulators delayed the enforcement of new rules banning gas-fired plants from spewing warmed coolant water into waterways — the same problem for which the state went after Diablo Canyon — in a bid to avoid blackouts.Last week, Newsom said California “would be remiss not to” file an application, due May 19, for federal funding to keep the plant open.In an email, Newsom spokesperson Erin Mellon cautioned that the “governor does not have authority over Diablo Canyon’s license,” but added that the “Governor is in support of keeping all options on the table to ensure we have a reliable grid.”Preventing a closure would require PG&E to apply to relicense the plant, then win approval from state and federal regulators. The process would likely take years. PG&E spokesperson Suzanne Hosn said in an email that the company was “always open to considering all options to ensure continued safe, reliable, and clean energy delivery to our customers.”A 2021 study by researchers at MIT and Stanford University found that retrofitting Diablo Canyon to keep it operating until 2035 would reduce power sector emissions in California more than 10% below 2017 levels and save the state $2.6 billion in power system costs. If operated until 2045, those savings increase to $21 billion.“We always knew this was a political decision, not a financial decision. So I think it’s huge in that this opens the door,” said Isabelle Boemeke, a pro-nuclear advocate in California who founded the group Save Clean Energy. “It’s just the beginning in terms of everything that needs to happen. ”But opponents of nuclear power say salvaging the power station would divert resources away from efforts to slash energy use and increase renewable electricity generation.“My worry is that if you create this false prospect that somehow Diablo Canyon stays around, you reduce pressure on everyone involved to accelerate the acquisition of new zero-carbon sources,” said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a key supporter of closing the plant. “Diablo Canyon is a false hope and a false prospect.”The state has many options to import clean power from neighboring states if its own development of new sources lags, Cavanagh said. He added that the labor union representing the workers at the plant supported its closure. But on Friday, the union, now under new leadership, issued a public statement of support for keeping Diablo Canyon open.“Californians are facing big challenges, from COVID to the impacts of extreme drought,” IBEW 1245 business manager Bob Dean wrote in a press release. “A shortage of electric power supply and rolling blackouts must not be added to this list.”The White House’s $6 billion bailout fund limits eligibility to plants that are losing money in the face of competition from gas and other energy sources. That means Diablo Canyon, which is not losing money, would likely not qualify.Paris Ortiz-Wines, a California-based organizer with the pro-nuclear group Stand Up for Nuclear, said Newsom was likely using the federal program as a way to signal his willingness to support the Biden administration’s efforts to keep reactors running.“There’s some game being played,” she said. “Diablo Canyon does not need the federal funding, but I do think it’s in the political conversation right now, so it’s a safe way to make his announcement.”Mark Nelson, a nuclear engineer and consultant who advocates for atomic power, said the move by Whitmer put pressure on Newsom. While Whitmer had not played the active role Newsom did in setting the stage for the next U.S. nuclear closures, the Michigan governor had remained silent throughout the process, according to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a think tank that pushed to keep Palisades open. Both governors are widely discussed as potential Democratic presidential candidates.“What he sees is another ambitious Democratic governor that’s pretty young going along with Biden’s desire, Sen. Joe Manchin’s desire and [Energy Secretary Jennifer] Granholm’s desire to save a nuclear plant,” Nelson said. “He wants to show, ‘I, too, can go along with the program if the program is nuclear.’”A spokesperson for Whitmer did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.But Chris Gadomski, the lead nuclear analyst at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, warned that the eligibility requirements of the federal fund would make it difficult for many utilities to apply. Natural gas prices have more than doubled since the legislation creating the fund was debated, meaning reactors that financially struggled in years past might have more balanced books now that higher costs are making nuclear power more competitive.“The way the rules are written, you have to be losing money to be eligible for support,” he said. “So now you have a problem: How can you close down nuclear plants when gas prices are so high? But when that’s the case, you have to change the rules.”Nelson said he would be “utterly unsurprised if not a penny were disbursed” from the federal fund. But he still sees it as progress toward saving the country’s existing reactors and, eventually, building more.“Nuclear plants are closing because they don’t know that they have long-term revenue, yet this is being addressed by an extremely short-termist program,” Nelson said. “I don’t look at the $6 billion as anything other than a very powerful, attractive sign of nuclear being in favor among Democrats.”"}, {"title": "Hawaii Volcano Lava Flow Steady After Starts And Stops", "text": "HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii’s Kilauea Volcano is now erupting a steady stream of lava after a period of intermittent pulsing.The latest eruption began in September but until recently had been stopping and starting every few days, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Monday.Now the pulsing nature of the eruption has ended and a steady flow of lava is once again filling the volcano’s crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The flow has been nonstop for more than two weeks.Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey said that while the volcano is ultimately unpredictable, the current activity shows no signs of slowing and some historic eruptions have lasted decades.“It could go on for quite some time,” said Ken Hon, scientist in charge of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. “For now it is reestablishing its conduits in the summit area.”A lava lake more than 300 feet deep (91.44 meters) has formed in Halemaumau Crater since the start of the latest eruption.There was another brief eruption in the crater that began in 2020 and lasted for several months. It was the first since a major 2018 eruption caused parts of the summit to collapse and massive amounts of lava to flow into Big Island neighborhoods.Halemaumau Crater has long been home to massive eruptions. The 2018 eruption drained all the lava from the summit lake that had been active there for years.“It’s an exciting time for volcano watchers,” said Ken Rubin, University of Hawaii professor of earth sciences.“It’s interesting to watch the pulse of the volcano,” Rubin said, “because although most of it is predictable or understandable by us after the fact, it doesn’t mean we’re able to fully explain every aspect that’s happening there in real time.”The eruption is within view from some areas of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, but officials say weather and time of day can change the visibility.“There are more visitors, and the active volcano is one of the reasons,” said Jody Anastasio, acting public information officer for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.To avoid crowds, Anastasio suggests visiting during late night or early morning hours when the glow of the lava lake can be seen from afar and fewer people are in the park."}, {"title": "Decades-Old Human Remains Found In Barrel As Lake Mead Recedes", "text": "Boaters at Lake Mead on Sunday stumbled across a barrel containing human remains that, based on the decayed nature of the metal drum, appear to have been there for several decades.“My husband heard a woman scream and then he went to look and found the body in a very deteriorated 50-gallon drum,” Shawna Hollister, a Las Vegas resident, told News 3. “He found a man that was mostly bones, except for some of his shirt and belt showing.”The discovery prompted a search of the area by National Park Service rangers, who assisted the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in recovering the remains.Photos of the site show a rusted-out barrel that’s partially submerged in mud roughly a foot from the edge of the current lake level.The Clark County coroner’s office told The Associated Press it will oversee efforts to determine the person’s identity.Las Vegas Metro Police Homicide Lt. Ray Spencer told 8 News Now the victim was likely killed in the 1980s, based on items found in the barrel. What’s more, Spencer said, he fully expects to find more bodies as the lake level drops.“I think anybody can understand there are probably more bodies that have been dumped in Lake Mead,” he said. “It’s just a matter of, are we able to recover those?”Lake levels at the nation’s largest reservoir have fallen amid a worsening megadrought in the region ― the driest in at least 1,200 years.

Internal emails reviewed by HuffPost show that these letters all had something in common: They were ghostwritten by lobbyists and consultants of the two major pipeline firms behind those projects.The communications show how Williams Companies Inc. and TC Energy Corporation worked to boost political support for a number of natural gas infrastructure projects currently under federal review to fill a void left behind by Dominion Energy and Duke Energy’s canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline.Industry watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute obtained the documents through a series of public records requests that it and others filed. It shared them exclusively with HuffPost.Meanwhile, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s premier climate research body, has released its latest sobering reports on global warming. The most recent analysis, published in early April, warns that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than 2025, then be slashed nearly in half by 2030 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change.On Jan. 10, Robert Crockett, the president of Advantus Strategies and a lobbyist for the Oklahoma-based Williams Companies, emailed Wayne Carter, the administrator of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, a draft letter of support for Williams’ Southside Reliability Enhancement Project. The proposed expansion of the company’s existing Transco natural gas pipeline would allow for more natural gas to be transported into North Carolina. The project includes the construction of a new, electric compressor station in Mecklenburg County.“Attached is a draft letter expressing support to the Williams project that we have reviewed with you and your board previously,” Crockett wrote. “Please feel free to modify.”Carter put his signature on the letter and sent it back to Crockett a couple of hours later with only minor tweaks.“Thank you Wayne!” Jay McChesney, a community and project outreach specialist at Williams, responded. “If you wouldn’t mind putting this in the mail and sending to FERC [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] that would be much appreciated…Thank you again for your support of our project.”The letter, which Carter submitted to the regulatory agency later that day on behalf of the county board of supervisors, notes that the project “will be done in a manner that is protective of the environment while providing much-needed benefits to our rural county” and applauds Williams for being “transparent and forthright as an existing corporate citizen in the state.”“We strongly encourage the FERC to approve this proposed project,” the letter reads.At least three Republican state legislators — state Sen. Frank Ruff and state Delegates Tommy Wright Jr. and Les Adams — submitted letters to FERC that contain language identical to or closely mirroring the language in Carter’s letter, indicating the extent to which the company worked behind the scenes.Ruff and Wright also submitted nearly identical letters to FERC in March in support of Williams’ separate Commonwealth Energy Connector Project, another Transco expansion aimed at increasing natural gas supply to southeastern Virginia.The Transco pipeline runs more than 10,000 miles from Texas to New York, transporting approximately 15% of the nation’s natural gas, according to the company’s website.Neither Carter nor 10 elected Republican officials who wrote to FERC to throw their support behind the gas projects responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.Ruff did address HuffPost’s specific questions but said via email that “Williams has been a good corporate citizen that has been involved in the region for over fifty years.”“They serve businesses that hire my constituents,” Ruff said. “If I did not agree with their value to the region, I would not have endorsed their efforts. I believe others would agree with that.”Williams Companies did not respond.Around the same time Williams was pulling political strings in Virginia, Wayne King, a lobbyist and former vice chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, was working to boost support for the project in the Tar Heel State. In January, King’s emails to the offices of two Republicans, North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore and Mooresville Mayor Miles Atkins, emphasized the need for stakeholders to weigh in.“For your convenience, I’ve attached a number of talking points,” King wrote in one exchange.Several of those talking points are included verbatim in the letters Moore and Atkins submitted to FERC, including how Williams is “a responsible corporate citizen, environmental steward, and reliable service provider” and how the project will “stimulate economic development in eastern North Carolina by providing increased access to clean, reliable, and affordable natural gas.”North Carolina Republican state Sen. Bob Steinburg’s letter to federal regulators also features some of the company’s talking points, including a statement about Williams demonstrating its “commitment to environmental stewardship.”Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of TC Energy, took similar action to garner support for two related projects it is pursuing in Virginia: the Virginia Reliability Project and Virginia Electrification Project. The projects would replace approximately 50 miles of existing pipeline near Petersburg and upgrade compressor stations in the system to boost natural gas capacity in Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.Emails show TC Energy distributed model letters that the Republican mayors of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake submitted in support of the company’s Virginia Reliability Project.“Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with Aaron Thompson and me regarding TC Energy’s Virginia Reliability Project,” Esmel Meeks, a consultant for TC Energy, wrote to Virginia Beach Mayor Robert Dyer in late February. (Thompson is a government and community relations adviser at TC Energy).“We appreciate your willingness to draft a letter of support to FERC and I am writing to follow up. We are in the process of submitting letters and I have attached a draft letter for your review.”The letter that Dyer submitted to FERC three days later is a carbon copy of the draft that Meeks provided and that was released as part of a public records request.Earlier that same month, Meeks provided a similar draft letter to the office of Chesapeake Mayor Rick West. Sandy Madison, one of the city’s deputy clerks, promptly informed Meeks that she’d printed the letter for the mayor to sign. “Please tidy this letter up and print on Mayor letterhead,” Madison later wrote to a colleague.West’s letter applauding the project and the company was submitted to FERC on Feb. 8.“Please know that the people and communities who would be most impacted by VRP are enthusiastic about its benefits,” it reads. “As mayor, I am proud to support it.”Lynn Godfrey, community outreach coordinator for the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, said the communications “tell you the whole story” about industry political influence in the Commonwealth. A native of Hampton Roads, she took particular issue with West’s assertion that the “most impacted” communities are in favor. Many communities are only just learning about the projects, she said.“These pipelines are coming through communities that are already cumulatively impacted by all types of pollutants,” she said. “People don’t want this poison in their neighborhood.”TC Energy did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about its role in the letter-writing. Instead, it said the project will help meet the growing economic needs of the Hampton Roads area.“Local officials, community leaders, businesses, and citizens in the area recognize this project meets their needs and is important for the future of the region, and that is why a broad bipartisan spectrum enthusiastically support the Virginia Reliability Project,” the company said in an emailed statement.In its application for Virginia Reliability Project, TC Energy said the project would help Virginia Natural Gas, a distribution company, meet growing gas demand not only from residents and businesses but more than a dozen military installations and the shipbuilding industry. Virginia Natural Gas is a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas, one of the original partners in the defunct Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The planned pipeline would have stretched 600 miles through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina and was met with fierce opposition from Indigenous and other local communities.In addition to the internal communications, a HuffPost review of the FERC docket found that four Republican state legislators in Virginia — Delegates Emily Brewer and John McGuire III and Sens. Bryce Reeves and Mark Peake — had submitted nearly identical letters in support of TC Energy’s Virginia Electrification Project.The project “will produce environmental benefits as it lowers emissions through the electrification of equipment, all while enhancing capacity,” they wrote.HuffPost is unable to confirm what role, if any, TC Energy played in crafting those letters; however, they are part of a clear trend.Godfrey said that if there is a need for more energy in the Hampton Roads area, it should be satisfied by renewables rather than gas projects that won’t come online for another 2-3 years.“The opposition is mounting,” she said. “All of these things are converging for another big fight.”"}, {"title": "Watch Belligerent Wild Turkey Come For A D.C. Biker", "text": "A fearless wild turkey has been attacking walkers, joggers and bikers on a trail in Washington, D.C., causing a flap.Several people have reported being chased, slammed into, clawed and pecked in encounters with the big bird on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail in the northeast section of the district.The turkey came for musician DeDe Folarin last month as he rode his bike through the area.“He jumped in the air and he almost clawed my face,” Folarin told local WJLA TV. “He kind of knocked me off the bike and literally chased me around for like five minutes.”When the turkey took off after another biker, Folarin recorded the confrontation on his cell phone — and then chased the bird off with a stick when the woman under attack called to him for help.Prince George County Parks and Recreation Department has put up a sign to discourage people from approaching the turkey.“Some people don’t listen,” Victor Davila of the parks agency told WJLA. “They try to go up to it and take pictures and stuff like that.”“There is an element of humor to it,” Dan Rauch, a D.C. Department of Energy and Environment wildlife biologist trying to catch the bird, told The Wall Street Journal. “There is a terror turkey stalking a river trail. If I hadn’t seen the videos myself, I would have thought it was an urban myth.”Wild turkeys are making a comeback across the nation. But encounters with humans can be problematic. Males fiercely guard their territories and may also be protecting nests in the spring. They can scratch and bruise people, and puncture skin with their beaks and claws.One victim of the D.C. bird reported in February on a local blog: “A wild turkey that attacked me on the Anacostia trail last night. I ended up at urgent care with puncture wounds on my legs and I had to get a tetanus shot and antibiotics. It was terrifying.”The tom is apparently becoming increasingly aggressive. Park guide Joe Cashman first encountered the bird with another guide last fall while they biked through the area.“We got a kick out of it,” Cashman told the Journal. “Then we started getting complaints. It started getting aggressive. It’s gotten more and more aggressive.”The plan now is to capture the turkey and relocate it. But the bird sometimes high-tails it across the Maryland state line, and takes flight when he sees nets, Cashman pointed out.In the meantime, Folarin said he’s been “prepping myself for the next turkey attack.”"}, {"title": "Arizona Wildfire Forces Fast Decision: Fight Or Flee Flames?", "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — In a small enclave in northern Arizona where homes are nestled in a Ponderosa pine forest and tourists delight in camping, hiking and cruising on ATVs, high winds are nothing new.But when those winds recently ramped up and sent what was a small wildfire racing toward their homes, residents in the close-knit Girls Ranch neighborhood near Flagstaff faced a dilemma: quickly grab what they could and flee, or stay behind and try to ward off the towering, erratic flames.Most of the property owners left. One couple stood their ground. Another raced to save animals on neighbors’ properties.The blaze that started Easter Sunday swept across vacant lots, scorched tree stumps and cast an orange glow on the parched landscape. Flames licked the corner of one woman’s porch and destroyed two other homes, leaving a mosaic of charred land as the 30-square-mile (77 square-kilometer) fire finally neared full containment this weekend.Elsewhere, firefighters in northern New Mexico on Sunday continued to battle the largest active wildfire in the U.S. as strong winds pushed it closer to the small city of Las Vegas.Officials said the blaze had damaged or destroyed 172 homes and at least 116 structures since it started April 6 and merged with another wildfire a week ago. Officials said the fire had grown to 162 square miles (419 square kilometers), but was still 30% contained.The blazes are among many this spring that forced panicked residents to make life-or-death, fight-or-flee snap decisions as wildfire season heats up in the U.S. West. Years of hotter and drier weather have the exacerbated blazes, leading them to frequently burn larger areas and for longer periods compared with previous decades.Some who live in Girls Ranch had just minutes to react.Polly Velie rushed out of a physical therapy appointment when she learned her home was in the evacuation zone. She sped through embers and thick smoke to find her husband hosing down the driveway. Her voice shrieked as she yelled above the smoke alarms going off throughout the house.“Bill, we gotta go!” she hollered.But Bill Velie — who cut fire lines with a dozer in multiple states for years — was intent on staying. It’s the same decision the couple made in 2010 when another wildfire in the area forced evacuations. Polly Velie said she’s never been more scared, but the choice wasn’t difficult: “This is our house, and he’s my husband.”The couple watched neighbors load up horses and donkeys and haul them off. They saw torched tumbleweeds fly across a major highway, flames tear through an old stone house and a propane tank burst.“Boy, that made her jump,” Bill Velie said. “Just like a bomb went off.”Firefighters encouraged them at least a handful of times to leave, and they agreed to if the winds shifted. More than anything, Bill Velie reassured them he had things under control.He had thinned parts of the national forest on the other side of his property line, and he regularly mows the grass. They kept sprinklers running outside, and Bill Velie bladed the edge of the forest a few times where it looked like the fire was crawling toward neighbors’ homes. At night, the flames twinkled on the hill behind them like red stars in the sky.“I’ve seen some exciting stuff, but not like this for a while,” he said. “Do I miss it? No.”Ali Taranto and her husband, Tim, own a house in the neighborhood. They saw news about the fire on a neighborhood Facebook page and drove from Winslow, where she works as a nurse about an hour away, to check on the 5-acre (2-hectare) property.Ali Taranto drove past the neighborhood’s namesake Girls Ranch property, once a home for troubled girls, and saw parts of the white fence melted to the ground.She checked on her neighbor, Marianne Leftwich, who said she was fine. But Taranto didn’t hear from her for about an hour. Then, Leftwich’s daughter called to say her mother was stuck in her house.Taranto alerted emergency responders, she said, but dispatch told her she’d probably get to Leftwich before they could. Taranto found the woman semi-conscious and gasping for air, in need of  help to evacuate, Taranto said.“As a community in an emergency like this, all the systems were totally overwhelmed,” Taranto said. “Thank God I got there and got her out in time.”Taranto took Leftwich’s dogs to a kennel, then returned to rescue a goat and a cow she saw roaming around nearby.Other than some burned grass and brush, Taranto’s property was unscathed.Harriet Young’s house overlooks the neighborhood. She hired an arborist last year to remove dead trees and cut low-lying branches as a fire-prevention measure. She had pinkish gravel laid on the long driveway and around the front of her house.Young believes it saved the home she and her late husband built in the 1990s. The wildfire burned all around it, sparing the house and the invasive olive trees that her daughter wished hadn’t survived.“This was a miracle, that’s all I got to say,” said Young’s daughter, Stacey Aldstadt, who stayed with her mom for a few days after the fire swept through.When they were allowed back home a week ago on Sunday, they had no heat or hot water. Young spent four days battling with propane companies to get it turned back on. Finally, she persuaded a former fire chief to come by and fix it.Everyone here knows Young, the staunch Democrat who regularly hosts Christmas parties. She made call after call as the fire progressed and planned to stay home, based on what she’d heard.But neighbor Jeanne Welnick saw the plume of smoke that seemed so distant grow and move toward their neighborhood, and urged Young to leave.“I owe Jeanne a huge ‘thank-you,’” Young said.The Welnicks initially bought the house behind Young’s as a vacation property. The previous owners built it with wildfire in mind.The 14-inch-thick (36-centimeter) exterior walls are concrete sandwiched by Styrofoam cells topped by a metal roof. Those walls are still standing.The rest of the Victorian ranch-style home painted orange with green trim isn’t.Flames tore through, twisting strips of metal that creaked as the wind blew through. Shards of glass and nails shot out onto the driveway where the Welnicks wrote their names and the year they bought the house, 2004.A cherub statue the Welnicks placed outside as a memorial to a child they lost to miscarriage looked down at the rubble. Two packages that were delivered to the walkway after the home burned held material for trellis arches the Welnicks planned to assemble over their vegetable garden. Unburned pavers and bags of sand sat off to the side of the garage, ready to be laid down.At midday, a bell that was near the front door to welcome them home rang out, hidden among piles of debris.Jeanne Welnick scanned the property, wondering which trees would survive. She grieved the loss of her paintings and a squash blossom necklace that was passed down through her husband’s family. She kept it in a glass case.“I’d like to look for that, but it’s probably not even there,” said Welnick, an artist.Their dogs, guitars and some sculptures made it out with them, through what Welnick described as a roaring train, dark, scary, like Armageddon.In the aftermath, some neighbors struggled with the right words to say to those who lost their homes. Some offered food, clothes, a place to stay and set up fundraising accounts.“They kept saying, ‘We love you so much; we love you so much,’” Welnick said. “And they do.”"}, {"title": "Millions Of Bees Die On Airport Tarmac After Delta Reroutes Flight", "text": "Millions of honeybees are dead after a flight carrying the pollinator insects from California to Alaska got diverted to Georgia, leading to the bees sitting in crates on the hot airport tarmac.“The worst part about it for me is how they suffered, and there was not a single thing I could do about it,” Sarah McElrea, who had ordered the bee shipment, told The New York Times.McElrea runs a honey company, and also sells bees to backyard beekeepers and commercial pollination services in Alaska. Last week, she was in Anchorage awaiting a shipment of 800 pounds of bees ― about 5 million individual bees ― when Delta Air Lines told her that the bees wouldn’t fit on the plane and were going to be rerouted through Atlanta, according to The Associated Press.The bees were supposed to wait in Atlanta until they could catch a new flight. Initially, Delta was keeping the bees in a cooler indoors, but when they started escaping the next day, the company moved them outside onto the hot tarmac, where the crates baked in the sun.Worried about the fate of the bees, McElrea contacted local Georgia beekeeper Edward Morgan for help. Morgan went to the scene and found that many of the bees had already died, Alaska Public Media reported. In addition to the heat stress in the 83-degree weather, the bees’ containers had also been positioned in such a way that they couldn’t get to the food that was supposed to sustain them for the journey, he told the Times.Delta spokesperson Catherine Morrow called what happened an “unfortunate situation” and told the AP that the company had apologized to McElrea. She added that Delta has “taken immediate action to implement new measures to ensure events of this nature do not occur in the future.”When it became apparent how dire the situation was, beekeepers in the area coordinated to rescue as many of the survivors as possible. More than 20 beekeepers showed up, breaking open crates, providing emergency sugar water to feed the bees, and transporting them to new homes. The exact number of dead bees is unknown, Morgan estimated “at least half” died, he told local news station WABE.McElrea told Alaska Public Media she’s thankful for the beekeepers’ rescue efforts.“I will forever be grateful for anything that they were able to salvage,” she said, adding that they “really are the heroes in this scenario.”"}, {"title": "Dogs' Breeds Don't Dictate Their Personalities, Study Finds", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Research confirms what dog lovers know — every pup is truly an individual.Many of the popular stereotypes about the behavior of golden retrievers, poodles or schnauzers, for example, aren’t supported by science, according to a new study.“There is a huge amount of behavioral variation in every breed, and at the end of the day, every dog really is an individual,” said study co-author and University of Massachusetts geneticist Elinor Karlsson.She said pet owners love to talk about their dog’s personality, as illustrated by some owners at a New York dog park.Elizabeth Kelly said her English springer spaniel was “friendly, but she’s also kind of the queen bee.” Suly Ortiz described her yellow Lab as “really calm, lazy and shy.”And Rachel Kim’s mixed-breed dog is “a lot of different dogs, personality wise — super independent, really affectionate with me and my husband, but pretty, pretty suspicious of other people, other dogs.”That kind of enthusiasm from pet owners inspired Karlsson’s latest scientific inquiry. She wanted to know to what extent are behavioral patterns inherited — and how much are dog breeds associated with distinctive and predictable behaviors?The answer: While physical traits such as a greyhound’s long legs or a Dalmatian’s spots are clearly inherited, breed is not a strong predictor of any individual dog’s personality.The researchers’ work, published Thursday in the journal Science, marshals a massive dataset to reach these conclusions — the most ever compiled, said Adam Boyko, a geneticist at Cornell University, who was not involved in the study.Dogs became humanity’s best friend more than 14,000 years ago, as the only animal domesticated before the advent of agriculture.But the concept of dog breeds is much more recent. Around 160 years ago, people began to selectively breed dogs to have certain consistent physical traits, like coat texture and color and ear shape.The researchers surveyed more than 18,000 dog owners and analyzed the genomes of about 2,150 of their dogs to look for patterns.They found that some behaviors — such as howling, pointing and showing friendliness to human strangers —do have at least some genetic basis. But that inheritance isn’t strictly passed down along breed lines.For example, they found golden retrievers that don’t retrieve, said co-author Kathryn Lord, who studies animal behavior with Karlsson.Some breeds, such as huskies and beagles, may show a greater tendency to howl. But many of these dogs don’t, as both the owner survey and genetic data showed.The researchers could find no genetic basis for aggressive behaviors nor a link to specific breeds.“The correlation between dog behavior and dog breed is much lower than most expected,” said Jeff Kidd, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, who had no role in the research.___AP reporter Emma H.

Andover Fire Chief Chad Russell said during a news conference early Saturday morning that 50 to 100 buildings were damaged in Sedgwick County, though it was not immediately known how many buildings were damaged in Andover.Russell said in some neighborhoods homes “were completely blown away.”Officials said only a few injuries had been reported. In Sedgwick County, three people were injured, including one woman who suffered serious injuries.

Some of the world’s great migratory bird populations stop here on their journey across continents, and its lush swamplands nurture an unparalleled diversity of animal and aquatic life, from threatened species like sturgeon and paddlefish to Louisiana’s world-famous crawfish.The area also has another abundant resource: oil and gas. Drilling rigs and hundreds of miles of pipelines mark the region, pumping out black gold that has long enriched Atchafalaya landowners. The oil industry has constructed a vast network of canals and “spoil banks,” or excavated piles of earth that rise 10 feet or more and act as earthen dams blocking the natural flow of water that drains south into the Gulf, a problem the oil and gas industry, landowners and state agencies have been reluctant to address.Scientists say these spoil banks are turning vast areas of the basin into stagnant pools of swamp water that are strangling the cypress forests and damaging the fisheries. Without this natural flow, huge tracts of the Atchafalaya Basin could be left unrecognizable.Experts say backfilling the canals, or providing more gaps in the spoil banks to let more water flow through, is necessary to make the basin more sustainable. A heated debate is underway between environmentalists and the landowners and oil companies who are resisting efforts to alter the banks — and imperiling the others who rely on the ecosystem.“What’s going on in the basin is criminal,” says Dean Wilson, head of the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper, a member organization that aims to protect the swamp. “The landowners don’t want to get rid of the spoil banks that are causing the problem. They want to get rid of the fishermen.”And there’s another problem that extends beyond the basin: Increasing volumes of sediment and silt from farms and urban runoff are pouring into the Mississippi River upstream and are creating dangerous flooding potential for New Orleans and other communities.That risk worries veteran marine scientist Ivor van Heerden, who has spent much of his career studying flooding and coastal protection issues in Louisiana and has worked with local environmental groups like the Basinkeeper to study restoration projects along the sediment-choked swamps of the Atchafalaya.“It’s a ticking time bomb that no one is addressing,” he said.Sediment has built up the Atchafalaya ever since engineers altered and increased the flow of the Mississippi River and the Red River into the region starting in the mid-1800s. The Army Corps of Engineers has been fighting floods ever since historic Mississippi River flooding across 27,000 square miles of the nation’s midsection and South in 1927, the most destructive flood in U.S. history. Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1928, which authorized the Corps to construct the largest system of levees and flood control measures in the world.In the 1960s, the Army Corps built the Old River Control Structure, a huge series of flood control gates that regulates Mississippi River flows into the Atchafalaya River. Located less than 80 miles north of Baton Rouge, the ORCS is the source of the Atchafalaya, which streams south on its 137-mile journey to the Gulf, roughly 130 miles west of the Mississippi River Delta.Today, depending on flood conditions, a little more than a quarter of the Mississippi River now pours into the Atchafalaya River, making it a critical floodway for southern Louisiana. The Atchafalaya River carries a sediment load of about 88 million tons each year, most all of it from the Mississippi River. The Atchafalaya is the country’s fifth largest river in terms of discharge, and it carries so much sand and sediment that it’s still building land along the Louisiana coast.Atchafalaya environmental, business and political leaders have complained about growing environmental and flooding threats for decades, but only recently have their complaints attracted statewide attention. In December 2020, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards created a task force to address the long-ignored risks, which have been exacerbated by climate change.“The basin’s stressors are not only harming water quality and the environment but also threatening the capacity of the basin to carry floodwaters from the Mississippi and the Red Rivers safely and effectively,” Edwards noted when he announced the formation of the task force. “The basin is the nation’s largest river-basin swamp with a rich ecology, and it is past time that it receives more focused attention here in Louisiana and nationally.”Major floods in 1973 and 2011 nearly overwhelmed the ORCS, which the Army Corps expanded and beefed up with more flood control measures. Hydrologists say the continuing buildup of sediment in the basin threatens its ability to absorb rising Mississippi River floodwaters. That, experts say, could threaten flooding along the Mississippi from the hugely important chemical industry corridor near Baton Rouge all the way to the critically important shipping port of New Orleans.While Army Corps officials say they are studying the growing problem, members of the state’s Atchafalaya task force say they don’t have time for more studies. Last year the group of nearly two dozen local politicians, scientists, landowners, fishermen and environmentalists met a half-dozen times and came up with a list of general recommendations, despite unexpected obstacles in the form of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and another damaging season of storms.Those included Hurricane Ida, which hit Louisiana in late August and nearly made a beeline for the Atchafalaya Basin. The Category 4 storm mercifully veered east at the last moment, but it killed more than 25 people across rural areas of the state and destroyed over a hundred square miles of Barataria marshland before it roared northeast, causing dozens more deaths and billions of dollars of damage across the country.Ida put an exclamation point on the task force’s mission, as scientists say climate change is going to make storms and flooding much worse in coming years. At the end of 2020, the group urged the state to take a more holistic approach to solving the growing environmental problems in the basin, focusing on environmental impacts that usually play second fiddle to navigation and flood control issues. It was the first time a state-sponsored entity called for restoring the north-south flow of swamp water and conserving deep-water habitats essential to the ecological health of the region.This new approach did not sit well with large landowners worried that increased water flow could give commercial fishermen more access to what they considered their private lands. Meanwhile, environmental groups continued to complain that state and federal agencies were still doing little about monitoring the worsening quality of swamp water bottled up by oil and gas canals and spoil banks.“The Atchafalaya is a complicated place,” says Brian Lezina, chief of planning for the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which sponsored the task force meetings. “Big problems require big solutions. We need more federal money to get things done here.”Commercial fisherman Jody Meche says the risk isn’t just flooding — increased sedimentation and poor water quality could devastate his industry. As president of the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association West, Meche says he’s watched a steady decline in the fishery since he started crawfishing as a kid with his dad and grandfather. Though the vast majority of Louisiana crawfish are now farm-raised, Meche has witnessed a steady decline in the health of the wild fishery that has sustained his family for generations.Crawfishing in the basin with his 25-year-old son Bryce last summer, their traps pulled in barely enough to cover gas for the day. Meche is a member of the governor’s task force and says water quality has deteriorated since oil and gas pipeline canals were built, blocking the natural flow of water that nourishes the crawfish in the swampy waters.“People come here from all over the world to eat our crawfish,” Meche said as he pulled up a trap with a dozen of the giant-clawed crustaceans crawling in the bottom. Years ago, he said, he would pull in 600 pounds of crawfish a day. Now he’s lucky to get half that. Scientists say reduced water flow caused by spoil banks and the buildup of sediment can reduce the level of oxygen crawfish depend on to reproduce and thrive. And as the water quality gets worse, Meche is worried he will have to stop fishing altogether.“When crawfish are not doing good, everything else is not going good,” said Meche. “They are like canaries in a mine shaft.”The basin landowners who have profited from its oil and gas operations reject the claim that the industry has wrecked the Atchafalaya. Rudy Sparks, vice president of land for Williams Inc., which holds 85,000 acres of land in the area, blames Army Corps flood control projects and government regulations for upending the natural state of the area.The company has been active in the area since founder Frank Williams moved to Louisiana in the 1870s and bought up swampland that ultimately became some of the largest logging operations in the nation. Eventually, Sparks says, the oil and gas industry supplanted logging revenue for his company until recent decades, when oil exploration largely moved offshore and local oil drilling operations dropped dramatically.Sparks says profits from the oil and timber days are largely done. He agrees there have been negative changes in water quality. But unlike some fishermen and environmental groups that blame the oil industry, Sparks says Army Corps projects — primarily designed to address navigation and flooding concerns — are mostly responsible for destroying water flow in the basin.“It’s a complicated mess. The whole forest and marsh is in severe decline,” Sparks said. “The Army Corps has done more to accelerate the decline of the basin than anyone else.”Army Corps officials admit there are sedimentation problems in the basin, but say they are studying ways to improve the situation. Jim Lewis, director of the Army Corps’ Mississippi River Science and Technology Office, has extensive experience studying the impacts of sediment in the Atchafalaya Basin. Lewis published a 2018 report that showed over the next 50 years, sedimentation in the Atchafalaya River could boost water levels by 3 feet over levels recorded in the 2011 flood event. That flood forced the Army Corps to open part of the emergency Morganza Spillway for just the second time, releasing a deluge of water from the Mississippi River that threatened Atchafalaya communities downstream.Lewis says the Atchafalaya is facing twin dangers from climate change: rising waters in the Gulf of Mexico and higher Mississippi River flows coming from the north. The Corps has not evaluated how miles of oil canals and spoil banks in the basin have impacted water quality, but Lewis says they “want to learn more.”Some scientists say there is good reason to believe that a nightmare could come true. Louisiana State University professor and hydrology expert Yi-Jun Xu has studied sediment flows in the region over the past two decades, and warns that growing levels of sediment are raising river water to dangerous levels and dramatically reducing the basin’s ability to absorb floodwater.Xu says his main concern is a potential disaster at the ORCS, which he believes is the weakest point in the Corps’ elaborate thousand-mile flood control system. If it were ever overtopped and significantly damaged, Xu thinks the Mississippi River could take a shorter course straight down the Atchafalaya River to the Gulf, cutting off the flow of Mississippi River water to petrochemical plants and communities all the way to New Orleans that depend on it for their survival.A 1980 paper from LSU engineering professor Raphael Kazmann and economics professor David Johnson examined the consequences of the failure of that structure and estimated it would cause up to $4 billion in damages in 1977 dollars, likely a huge underestimate since the study did not take into account the costs of rebuilding drinking water infrastructure, as well as the relocation of residents impacted by the potential disaster.The authors said it’s not a question of if, but when. “Just when this will occur cannot be predicted: It could happen next year, during the next decade, sometime in the next 30 or 40 years,” they wrote in 1980. “But the final outcome is simply a matter of time and it is only prudent to prepare for it.”In January, Congress at last stepped up to the plate, authorizing $2.7 billion for Louisiana’s coastal restoration and flood protection projects as part of federal hurricane relief and infrastructure bills. State officials say they plan to direct at least $78 million to basin flooding and water quality projects. But many locals say the state needs to kick in more of its own money too. Currently, Louisiana does not include the Atchafalaya Basin in its $50 billion coastal restoration plan, and it spends only about $6 million a year on projects in the region. Environmentalists and landowners alike say that’s a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed to protect the natural resources of the area.But the Basinkeeper group argues more money won’t solve the problem if changes aren’t made in how it’s spent. Wilson’s small organization has played an outsize role in alerting the world to destructive environmental activities in Louisiana’s secretive swamplands. He’s taken on powers big and small, including Walmart, Home Depot and Lowe’s over their purchase of commercial mulch logged from thousands of acres of majestic cypress forests, a practice that Wilson played a role in stopping a decade ago. He says state funding for basin flood control projects has been detrimental to the environment and has benefited special interest groups like landowners and the oil industry.In recent years, Wilson has taken on the region’s largest landowners and fossil fuel companies, as well as state agencies and the Army Corps, which he also blames for much of the environmental decline in the region. The Basinkeeper has worked closely with environmental lawyers to fight construction of massive natural gas pipelines and pry information out of agency files that can shine a light on the degradation of the basin. In 2018, the Basinkeeper filed suit in an unsuccessful effort to stop the controversial Bayou Bridge oil pipeline that now cuts through the Atchafalaya swamp, pumping up to hundreds of thousands of barrels of Texas crude daily to Louisiana refineries. Currently, with the help of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, the Basinkeeper is suing the Army Corps under the Freedom of Information Act to unearth data related to water quality issues.Wilson is especially upset his organization was not included on the Atchafalaya task force, though he supports its recommendations to focus on environmental issues. But in the end, he worries little will be done to improve water quality. His group has complained about flood control projects sponsored by the Army Corps, including a levee in the basin’s Coon Trap area that failed last year and he says allowed a significant amount of silt-laden river water to pour into the swamps.The Basinkeeper is also critical of another major environmental organization active in the region, The Nature Conservancy, the world’s largest conservation NGO with $1.2 billion in total revenue and support in 2020. The nonprofit operates a 5,300-acre preserve in the Atchafalaya and is studying ways to improve water quality and the environment in the region. Earlier this month, the group made public that it had purchased an additional 3,700 acres from Dow Chemical Co. to boost its conservation program in the area. The Conservancy has received support for its basin work from a variety of nonprofit, state and corporate funders, including a $1.6 million grant from Shell Pipeline Co. and financial support from Enterprise Products, a gas pipeline operator in the basin.Conservancy officials say a major focus is improving water flow in the East Grand Lake area, which has suffered from increased sedimentation and water quality problems over the years. The project has been opposed by environmentalists, local residents and fishermen who worry it will result in the introduction of more silt- and sediment-laden water into the swamps that can add more land, which is generally supported by landowners and oil and gas industry interests.The Conservancy’s scientists push back on this criticism, saying they are actively monitoring the area to improve the environment. Bryan Piazza, the Conservancy’s director of freshwater and marine science in Louisiana, says the group is working as an “honest broker” with all Atchafalaya interests to improve water quality in the region despite opposition from fishermen and the Basinkeeper. “If we can get the water flowing again it will benefit everyone,” Piazza said. The controversial East Grand Lake project was paused by the state over the past year, but officials say they are now working with the Army Corps to get a permit approved.The Conservancy’s state director, Karen Gautreaux, who sits on the governor’s task force and formerly worked for the state, agrees water quality is a growing problem in the basin. She argues that working with other interests, including the oil and gas industry, is key to finding solutions to complex environmental issues. “Being a conservationist and a landowner are not mutually exclusive,” she said.But Wilson and fishermen like Meche who have lived and worked in the Atchafalaya for decades, argue that projects like East Grand Lake are working against the best interests of the swamp. Van Heerden, the scientist who has worked with the Basinkeeper, says his analysis shows the proposed project on Conservancy land will end up “making things worse.” And in Wilson’s view, the oil industry and landowners are getting what they want.“They are just filling in the swamp,” said Wilson.While virtually everyone agrees that water quality is a problem in the Atchafalaya, major landowners like Williams Inc.’s Sparks are “uncomfortable” with state task force recommendations they say would create deeper water flow in some areas and promote public fishing access to their private lands, something fishing groups deny. But Sparks says if nothing is done to fight increasing sedimentation in the basin, river bottoms and water levels will keep rising, including in the grandest river of all, the Mississippi.Many experts agree the Mississippi River is overdue to change course, as it has naturally done over eons of time. Scientists say no matter what we do to try to contain the Mississippi, it will always fight to change its path as sediment builds up. The great nonfiction writer John McPhee, who wrote extensively about the region, described the Mississippi River’s changing history as “a pianist playing with one hand — frequently and radically changing course, surging over the left or the right bank to go off in new directions.”What concerns Xu and others even more is that climate change and growing sedimentation of the riverbeds is creating a perfect storm that will be hard to stop. Xu worries that a major hurricane the size of Hurricane Katrina or Harvey will hit the Mississippi area northwest of New Orleans.That, he says, could dislodge a 500 million-ton slug of built-up river sediment, creating floodwaters that could overwhelm the ORCS. That would allow the river to seek a path down the Atchafalaya, destroying towns, levees and swamplands in its raging rampage to the Gulf. “We are underestimating the seriousness of the situation,” Xu says. “Many people in the Corps are engineers who think an engineering approach can keep this from happening … but we can’t fight that massive amount of sediment moving in such a short period of time.”Army Corps experts disagree with these dire predictions. While they acknowledge that climate change is driving increased rainfall and more powerful storms in the area, they say there have been major improvements made in the ORCS and the levee system since it was significantly damaged in a major 1973 flood. The Corps continues to closely monitor and model flooding emergencies in the region, and officials are confident they can handle whatever threats Mother Nature throws at them.John Day, an LSU emeritus professor of marine sciences, says it’s likely the Mississippi will change course, though he’s not sure where. Both Day and other scientists say it’s time to transition our thinking from restoring nature to adapting to it, which will require protecting certain communities over others.“We need to protect the infrastructure of our fisheries,” said Day.That’s something many people in the Atchafalaya Basin would support. Henderson Mayor Sherbin Collette grew up in a family of fishermen. He’s been mayor of Henderson for 17 years and has helped make the small town prosperous as the “Gateway to the Atchafalaya,” which features a dinosaur park and casino that attracts visitors off busy I-10. More theme parks are being planned, and the town’s bank account is $3 million in the green, the mayor says. But he worries that may not last for long as the threat of flooding increases.“I remember when the Atchafalaya Basin was a gem,” he said. “Now it’s full of stagnant water and stinks to high heaven. … They ruined the basin because of oil.”But it’s the increasing storms and hurricanes that worry him the most. Collette says Henderson has been lucky over the past few years, but that luck won’t always hold. “Two-thirds of the U.S. drains down here,” he said. “If you think it’s bad now, just wait.”One of the ironies of the Atchafalaya Basin is that some people who live near the delta on the Gulf may be more secure from flooding than others who live farther away from the coast. That’s because the sediment-laden Atchafalaya River is building land in the delta, which is growing about a square mile per year on average.LSU’s Robert Twilley, a veteran coastal researcher and the longtime director of the Louisiana Sea Grant program until last year, has spent much of his career researching the coastal zone of the Atchafalaya Basin. He says the delta is of special interest to researchers around the world because it’s building land in the face of rising seas, which Twilley expects to continue for decades barring a catastrophic flooding event.Eventually, though, rising seas will overcome the sedimentation effects of the river. At that point, he said, “all bets are off.”But if the Mississippi River ever does change course down the Atchafalaya, even sea level rise would be no match for Old Man River, Twilley said. “It would make one hell of a delta.”Funding for this story was provided by the Society of Environmental Journalists Rapid Response Grants, which included support from the Hewlett Foundation, the Bullitt Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation."}, {"title": "'Wolf Sighting' Turns Out To Be Roving Pack Of Saint Bernards: Officials", "text": "A woman in Colorado reported seeing wolves, but authorities say there was a decidedly more slobbery explanation.Colorado Parks and Wildlife received a “report and accompanying video of a possible wolf sighting” on Monday, according to a news release from the Park County Sheriff’s Office, which assisted in investigating the case of the mysterious canines.The video in question shows large canines traversing a snow-covered landscape from some distance away.“Based on information the Sheriff has received, it is believed that the sighting was actually a group of large-breed St. Bernard dogs that live in the area and have a documented history of escaping their enclosure in the area,” the release said.The dogs’ owner also “confirmed the five dogs were running loose” at the same time the sighting occurred.Gloria Adams, the woman who shot the video, maintains she wasn’t just crying wolf.“They were chasing the elk when I first spotted them, there were seven WOLVES,” she told HuffPost in an email, adding that the animals she saw had “pointed ears” and were about four miles from where she knows the notorious Saint Bernards live.But officials don’t believe the animals caught on camera were indeed wolves.“There are no known wolves in this area,” parks and wildlife spokesperson Travis Duncan told HuffPost in an email. “This area is approximately 100 miles south of the area where we know of an existing pack.”The sheriff’s office said the distance, along with the “lighting and shadows,” could have made it erroneously appear that the animals were wolves.It would hardly have been the only time that domestic pets have been mistaken for wildlife.

Bronx Zoo Announces Birth Of Rare Tree Kangaroo", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — A baby tree kangaroo that’s just poking its nose out of its mother’s pouch is the first of its species born at the Bronx Zoo since 2008, zoo officials announced Friday.The birth of the Matschie’s tree kangaroo joey “is an exciting birth for the Bronx Zoo and a unique opportunity for people to observe one of nature’s most intriguing evolutionary adaptations,” zoo director Jim Breheny said in a news release.The Matschie’s tree kangaroo is native to Papua New Guinea and is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is arboreal and lives in mountain rainforests.The species is much smaller than Australia’s well-known red kangaroo. An adult male Matschie’s tree kangaroo weighs between 20 and 25 lb (9–11 kg). The joey is about the size of a human thumbnail at birth, zoo officials said. The tiny joey crawls through the mother’s fur to enter her pouch and emerges after about seven months.“At this stage of development, the joey will spend a lot of time in his mom’s pouch with just its head sticking out,” Breheny said. “As it matures it will begin to explore its environment and start spending short periods of time outside the pouch.”Conservationists believe that fewer than 2,500 Matschie’s tree kangaroos remain in the wild.

Schools in eastern Indian state Odisha have been shut for a week and in neighboring West Bengal, schools are stocking up on oral rehydration salts for kids. On Tuesday, Rajgarh, a city of over 1.5 million people in central India, was the country’s hottest, with daytime temperatures peaking at 46.5 degrees Celsius (114.08 Fahrenheit). Temperatures breached the 45 C (113 F) mark in nine other cities.But it was the heat in March — the hottest in India since records first started being kept in 1901 — that stunted crops. Wheat is very sensitive to heat, especially during the final stage when its kernels mature and ripen. Indian farmers time their planting so that this stage coincides with India’s usually cooler spring.Climate change has made India’s heat wave hotter, said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the Imperial College of London. She said that before human activities increased global temperatures, heat waves like this year’s would have struck India once in about half a century.“But now it is a much more common event — we can expect such high temperatures about once in every four years,” she said.India’s vulnerability to extreme heat increased 15% from 1990 to 2019, according to a 2021 report by the medical journal The Lancet. It is among the top five countries where vulnerable people, like the old and the poor, have the highest exposure to heat. It and Brazil have the the highest heat-related mortality in the world, the report said.Farm workers like Baldev Singh are among the most vulnerable. Singh, a farmer in Sangrur in northern India’s Punjab state, watched his crop shrivel before his eyes as an usually cool spring quickly shifted to unrelenting heat. He lost about a fifth of his yield. Others lost more.“I am afraid the worst is yet to come,” Singh said.Punjab is India’s “grain bowl” and the government has encouraged cultivation of wheat and rice here since the 1960s. It is typically the biggest contributor to India’s national reserves and the government had hoped to buy about a third of this year’s stock from the region. But government assessments predict lower yields this year, and Devinder Sharma, an agriculture policy expert in northern Chandigarh city said he expected to get 25% less.The story is the same in other major wheat-producing states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Overall, India purchased over 43 million metric tons (47.3 million U.S. tons) of wheat in 2021. Sharma estimates it will instead get 20% to nearly 50% less.Even though it is the world’s second-largest producer of wheat, India exports only a small fraction of its harvest. It had been looking to capitalize on the global disruption to wheat supplies from Russia’s war in Ukraine and find new markets for its wheat in Europe, Africa, and Asia.That looks uncertain given the tricky balance the government must maintain between demand and supply. It needs about 25 million tons (27.5 million U.S. tons) of wheat for the vast food welfare program that usually feeds more than 80 million people.Before the pandemic, India had vast stocks that far exceeded its domestic needs — a buffer against the risk of famine.Those reserves have been strained, Sharma said, by distribution of free grain during the pandemic to about 800 million people — vulnerable groups like migrant workers. The program was extended until September but it’s unclear if it will continue beyond then.“We are no longer with that kind of a surplus . . . with exports now picking up, there would be a lot of pressure on the domestic availability of wheat,” Sharma said.India’s federal agriculture and commerce ministries didn’t respond to questions sent to them via email.Beyond India, other countries are also grappling with poor harvests that hinder their ability to help offset the potential shortfall of supplies from Russia and Ukraine, normally the world’s largest and fifth-largest exporters of wheat.China’s agriculture minister, Tang Renjian, said last month that the winter wheat harvest was likely to be poor, hindered by flooding and by delays in planting.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The truth is: The vast majority of plastic cannot be recycled.”The Los Angeles Times noted that Bonta’s investigation comes as lawmakers across California work to reduce plastic waste and ban some types of single-use plastic. A proposed measure on the California ballot in November could give voters the chance to mandate all single-use plastic packaging be recyclable, refillable or compostable by 2030.Exxon is the first company to receive a subpoena, but Reuters reported that other companies are likely to get a call from Bonta’s office. The attorney general said in a news conference he believed Exxon was a “major source of global plastics pollution” and that it had used deceptive practices for decades, The Hill reported.Despite a widespread belief that many plastics are recyclable, less than 9% of plastics were recycled in the U.S. in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The remaining 91% ends up in landfills, is incinerated or winds up in the environment.A 2020 report by NPR and PBS’ “Frontline” found the plastics industry knew recycling the products would be prohibitively “costly” and “infeasible” as early as the 1970s. But the industry spent millions of dollars a year touting the benefits of plastic and encouraging consumers to recycle anyway.Bonta said his office would target the industry’s effort to minimize public understanding about the “harmful consequences of these products,” homing in on the “historic and ongoing efforts to deceive the public.”“The plastics industry, comprised of major fossil fuel and petrochemical companies, began an aggressive ― and deceptive ― marketing and advertising campaign to convince the public that they could recycle their way out of the plastic waste problem,” he said Thursday. “Executives at major fossil fuel companies, however, knew the truth.”"}, {"title": "Is Russia Using Dolphins To Guard Key Naval Base?

Brooks, a biologist at University of Nebraska State Museum and co-author of the book “The Stockholm Paradigm: Climate Change and Emerging Disease,” said the study acknowledges the threat posed by climate change in terms of increasing risk of infectious diseases.“This particular contribution is an extremely conservative estimate for potential” emerging infectious disease spread caused by climate change, said Brooks.Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and interim director of The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the study confirms long-held suspicions about the impact of warming on infectious disease emergence.“Of particular note is that the study indicates that these encounters may already be happening with greater frequency and in places near where many people live,” Bernstein said.Study co-author Gregory Albery, a disease ecologist at Georgetown University, said that because climate-driven infectious disease emergence is likely already happening, the world should be doing more to learn about and prepare for it.“It is not preventable, even in the best case climate change scenarios,” Albery said.Carlson, who was also an author on the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said we must cut greenhouse gas and phase out fossil fuels to reduce the risk of infectious disease spread.Jaron Browne, organizing director of the climate justice group Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, said the study highlights climate injustices experienced by people living in African and Asian nations.“African and Asian nations face the greatest threat of increased virus exposure, once again illustrating how those on the frontlines of the crisis have very often done the least to create climate change,” Browne said."}, {"title": "1 In 5 Reptile Species In The World Threatened With Extinction", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Even the king cobra is “vulnerable.” More than 1 in 5 species of reptiles worldwide are threatened with extinction, according to a comprehensive new assessment of thousands of species published Wednesday in the journal Nature.Of 10,196 reptile species analyzed, 21% percent were classified as endangered, critically endangered or vulnerable to extinction — including the iconic hooded snakes of South and Southeast Asia.“This work is a very significant achievement — it adds to our knowledge of where threatened species are, and where we must work to protect them,” said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study.Similar prior assessments had been conducted for mammals, birds and amphibians, informing government decisions about how to draw boundaries of national parks and allocate environmental funds.Work on the reptile study – which involved nearly 1,000 scientists and 52 co-authors – started in 2005. The project was slowed by challenges in fundraising, said co-author Bruce Young, a zoologist at the nonprofit science organization NatureServe.“There’s a lot more focus on furrier, feathery species of vertebrates for conservation,” Young said, lamenting the perceived charisma gap. But reptiles are also fascinating and essential to ecosystems, he said.The Galapagos marine iguana, the world’s only lizard adapted to marine life, is classified as “vulnerable” to extinction, said co-author Blair Hedges, a biologist at Temple University. It took 5 million years for the lizard to adapt to foraging in the sea, he said, lamenting “how much evolutionary history can be lost if this single species” goes extinct.Six of the world’s species of sea turtles are threatened. The seventh is likely also in trouble, but scientists lack data to make a classification.Worldwide, the greatest threat to reptile life is habitat destruction. Hunting, invasive species and climate change also pose threats, said co-author Neil Cox, a manager at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s biodiversity assessment unit.Reptiles that live in forest areas, such as the king cobra, are more likely to be threatened with extinction than desert-dwellers, in part because forests face greater human disruptions, the study found."}, {"title": "Millions Ordered To Cut Water Use In Drought-Stricken California", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Southern California’s gigantic water supplier took the unprecedented step Tuesday of requiring about 6 million people to cut their outdoor watering to one day a week as drought continues to plague the state.The board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California declared a water shortage emergency and required the cities and water agencies it supplies to implement the cutback on June 1 and enforce it or face hefty fines.“We don’t have enough water supplies right now to meet normal demand. The water is not there,” Metropolitan Water District spokesperson Rebecca Kimitch said. “This is unprecedented territory. We’ve never done anything like this before.”The Metropolitan Water District uses water from the Colorado River and the State Water Project to supply 26 public water agencies that provide water to 19 million people, or 40% of the state’s population.But record dry conditions have strained the system, lowering reservoir levels, and the State Water Project — which gets its water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta — has estimated it will only be able to deliver about 5% of its usual allocation this year.January, February and March of this year were the driest three months in recorded state history in terms of rainfall and snowfall, Kimitch said.The Metropolitan Water District said that the 2020 and 2021 water years had the least rainfall on record for two consecutive years. In addition, Lake Oroville, the State Water Project’s main reservoir, reached its lowest point last year since being filled in the 1970s.California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked people to voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 15%, but so far residents have been slow to meet that goal.Several water districts have instituted water conservation measures. On Tuesday, the board of the East Bay Municipal Utility District voted to reduce water usage by 10% and cap daily usage for some 1.4 million customers in Contra Costa and Alameda counties, including Oakland and Berkeley.Households will be allowed to use 1,646 gallons (6,231 liters) per day — far above the average household usage of about 200 gallons (757 liters) daily — and the agency expected that only 1% to 2% of customers will exceed the limit, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.The Metropolitan Water District restrictions apply to areas of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties that rely mostly on state water supplied through the district, including some parts of Los Angeles city. Mainly urban areas are impacted.The MWD’s client water agencies must implement either the one-day-a-week outdoor use restriction or find other ways of making equivalent reductions in water demand, Kimitch said.Although the water agencies support the water conservation move, it remains to be seen whether the public will do it, Kimitch said.The Metropolitan Water District will monitor water use and if the restrictions don’t work, it could order an all-out ban on outdoor watering as soon as September, she said.Meanwhile, state lawmakers have taken the first step toward lowering the standard for how much water people use in their homes.California’s current standard for residential indoor water use is 55 gallons (208 liters) per person per day. The rule doesn’t apply to customers, meaning regulators don’t write tickets to people for using more water than they are allowed. Instead, the state requires water agencies to meet that standard across all of its customers.But the state Senate overwhelmingly voted last week to lower the standard to 47 gallons (178 liters) per person per day starting in 2025 and 42 gallons (159 liters) per person per day beginning in 2030.The bill has not yet passed the Assembly, meaning it is still likely months away from becoming law.The U.S. West is in the middle of a severe drought just a few years after record rain and snowfall filled reservoirs to capacity. Scientists say this boom-and-bust cycle is driven by climate change that will be marked by longer, more severe droughts. A study from earlier this year found the U.S. West was in the middle of a megadrought that is now the driest in at least 1,200 years."}, {"title": "Climate Activist's Self-Immolation Prompts Conversations On Protest And Faith", "text": "Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old climate activist and Buddhist,  set himself on fire in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, prompting a national conversation about his motivation and whether he may have been inspired by Buddhist monks who self-immolated in the past to protest government atrocities.Bruce, a photographer from Boulder, Colorado, walked up to the plaza of the Supreme Court around 6:30 p.m. Friday – on Earth Day — then sat down and set himself ablaze, a law enforcement official said. Supreme Court police officers responded immediately but were unable to extinguish the blaze in time to save him.Investigators, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said they did not immediately locate a manifesto or note at the scene and that officials were still working to determine a motive.On Saturday, Kritee Kanko, a Zen Buddhist priest who described herself as Bruce’s friend, shared an emotional post on her public Twitter account saying his self-immolation was “not suicide” but “a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis.”She added that Bruce had been planning the act for at least a year. She wrote: “#wynnbruce I am so moved.” She got sympathetic responses as well as backlash.Kanko and other members of the Rocky Mountain Ecodharma Retreat Center in Boulder, released a statement Monday  saying “none of the Buddhist teachers in the Boulder area knew about (Bruce’s) plans to self-immolate on this Earth Day,” and that had they known about his plan, they would have stopped him. Bruce was a frequent visitor to the Buddhist retreat center in the mountains near Boulder where he meditated with the community, Kanko said.“We have never talked about self-immolation, and we do not think self-immolation is a climate action,” the statement said. “Nevertheless, given the dire state of the planet and worsening climate crisis, we understand why someone might do that.”On Facebook, Bruce wrote about following the spiritual tradition of Shambhala, which combines Tibetan Buddhism with the principles of living “an uplifted life, fully engaged with the world,” according to the Boulder Shambhala Center. Bruce also posted praise for Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a leader of engaged Buddhism, around the time of his death in January.Bruce’s act of sitting down and setting himself on fire was reminiscent of the events of June 11, 1963, when Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese monk, seated cross-legged, burned himself to death at a busy Saigon intersection. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ngo Dinh Diem, a staunch Catholic.In a letter to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr,. whom Hanh counted as a friend, Hanh wrote that he drew inspiration from the Vietnamese monk’s self-sacrifice, saying: “To burn oneself by fire is to prove what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity.”In Tibet, anti-Chinese activists have employed self-immolation as a form of protest. The International Campaign for Tibet says 131 men and 28 women – monks, nuns and laypeople among them – have self-immolated since 2009 to protest against Beijing’s strict controls over the region and their religion.Buddhism as a religion does not unilaterally condone the act of self-immolation or taking one’s life, said Robert Barnett, a London-based researcher of modern Tibetan history and politics.“Killing yourself is considered damaging in Buddhism because life is precious,” he said. “But if a person self-immolates because of a higher motivation and it’s not out of a negative emotion such as depression or sadness, then the Buddhist position becomes far more complex.”If self-immolation is done to help the world, it might be accepted as a positive action, Barnett said. He cited a story from the “Jataka Tales,” a body of South Asian literature concerning the prior incarnations of the Buddha in human and animal form. In that particular tale, an incarnation of the Buddha, in an act of selfless compassion, offers himself to an emaciated tigress who was so hungry that she was ready to devour her own cubs.“But that kind of self-sacrifice is not encouraged, developed or talked about for normal people (other than the Buddha),” he said, adding that this is because of “the immense difficulty of cultivating positive motivation in any situation, let alone maintaining it under stress or in conditions of extreme pain.”Buddhism emphasizes emotional balance, inclusiveness, kindness, compassion and wisdom, said Roshi Joan Halifax, an environmental activist and abbot of the Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico.“What we’re seeing today among many people is hopelessness,” she said. “What we are called to do is not to be disabled by that sense of futility, but to transform our moral suffering into wise hope and courageous action.”Despite the pessimism that some climate activists may feel, there is reason to remain hopeful, Halifax said.“You see that people are waking up to the magnitude of the climate catastrophe,” she said, noting that countries and corporations are moving away from damaging practices and toward clean energy.“I feel inspired and hopeful by our ability to change and adapt in this ever-changing world,” she said. “My heart is heavy that (Bruce) did not have that kind of optimism.”Those who knew Bruce saw a man who was kind, playful and idealistic – an avid dancer who participated in weekly events. He was also known for biking and embracing public transportation.Bruce, who enjoyed the outdoors, brought an intensity to whatever he did, said his friend Jeffry Buechler. On Buechler’s wedding day in 2014, Bruce, on a whim, decided to go for a dip in a cold mountain lake early in the morning, he said.Bruce also suffered lasting effects from a brain injury he sustained in a car wreck that killed his best friend about 30 years ago, Buechler said.Marco DeGaetano, who met Bruce in the 1990s when they both attended a Universalist church in Denver, said “Wynn seemed to have an affinity for people who needed help.”He recalled Bruce being kind to a church member with a mental illness when others distanced themselves.DeGaetano said he last saw Bruce about a month ago, and he seemed outgoing and friendly as always — every time he saw Bruce, “he had a smile on his face.”___Bharath reported from Los Angeles and Slevin from Denver.

Warns: Get Ready For A Lot More Catastrophes In Next 10 Years", "text": "A disaster-weary globe will be hit harder in the coming years by even more catastrophes colliding in an interconnected world, a United Nations report issued Monday says.If current trends continue the world will go from around 400 disasters per year in 2015 to an onslaught of about 560 catastrophes a year by 2030, the scientific report by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction said. By comparison from 1970 to 2000, the world suffered just 90 to 100 medium to large scale disasters a year, the report said.The number of extreme heat waves in 2030 will be three times what it was in 2001 and there will be 30% more droughts, the report predicted. It’s not just natural disasters amplified by climate change, it’s COVID-19, economic meltdowns and food shortages. Climate change has a huge footprint in the number of disasters, report authors said.People have not grasped how much disasters already cost today, said Mami Mizutori, chief of the UN Office of Disaster Risk Reduction, “If we don’t get ahead of the curve it will reach a point where we cannot manage the consequences of disaster,” she said. “We’re just in this vicious cycle.”That means society needs to rethink how it finances, handles and talks about the risk of disasters and what it values the most, the report said. About 90% of the spending on disasters currently is emergency relief with only 6% on reconstruction and 4% on prevention, Mizutori said in an interview Monday.Not every hurricane or earthquake has to turn into a disaster, Mizutori said. A lot of damage is avoided with planning and prevention.In 1990, disasters cost the world about $70 billion a year. Now they cost more than $170 billion a year, and that’s after adjusting for inflation, according to report authors. Nor does that include indirect costs we seldom think about that add up, Mizutori said.For years disaster deaths were steadily decreasing because of better warnings and prevention, Mizutori said. But in the last five years, disaster deaths are “way more” than the previous five years, said report co-author Roger Pulwarty, a U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and social scientist.That’s because both COVID-19 and climate change disasters have come to places that didn’t used to get them, like tropical cyclones hitting Mozambique, Mizutori said. It’s also the way disasters interact with each other, compounding damage, like wildfires plus heatwaves or a war in Ukraine plus food and fuel shortages, Pulwarty said.Pulwarty said if society changes the way it thinks about risk and prepares for disasters, then the recent increase in yearly disaster deaths could be temporary, otherwise it’s probably “the new abnormal.”Disasters are hitting poorer countries harder than richer ones, with recovery costs taking a bigger chunk out of the economy in nations that can’t afford it, co-author Markus Enenkel of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative said.“These are the events that can wipe out hard-earned development gains, leading already vulnerable communities or entire regions into a downward spiral,” he said.The sheer onslaught of disasters just add up, like little illnesses attacking and weakening the body’s immune system, Pulwarty said.The report calls for an overhaul in how we speak about risk. For example, instead of asking about the chances of a disaster happening this year, say 5%, officials should think about the chances over a 25-year period, which makes it quite likely. Talking about 100-year floods or chances of something happening a couple times in 100 years makes it seem distant, Mizutori said.“In a world of distrust and misinformation, this is a key to moving forward,” said University of South Carolina Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute Co-Director Susan Cutter, who wasn’t part of the report. “We can move forward to reduce the underlying drivers of risk: Inequality, poverty and most significantly climate change.”___Follow AP’s climate coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

(AP) — Firefighters across the country are battling multiple wildfires as tinder-dry conditions and high winds whip up flames from Arizona to Florida — including a prairie fire in rural southwestern Nebraska that has killed one person, injured at least 15 firefighters and destroyed at least six homes.A break in the weather in parts of the Midwest and West allowed crews to make progress Monday on some of the nearly dozen new large fires that were reported in recent days across the nation — four in New Mexico, three in Colorado and one each in Florida, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas.With more than 1,350 square miles (3,496 square kilometers) burned so far this year, officials at the National Interagency Fire Center said the amount of land singed to date is outpacing the 10-year average by about 30%.Hotter, drier weather has combined with a persistent drought to worsen fire danger across many parts of the West, where decades of fire suppression have resulted in overgrown and unhealthy forests and increasing development have put more communities at risk.In northern New Mexico, evacuations remained in place for several communities Monday and conditions were still too volatile for authorities to assess the damage caused Friday and Saturday. The blaze has has grown into the largest wildfire burning in the U.S., charring more than 88 square miles (228 square kilometers).Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation joined Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on a call Monday with officials from the White House and federal agencies to appeal for more federal ground resources ahead of another blast of strong fire-fueling winds expected later in the week.Thanks to lighter winds in the Midwest on Monday, firefighters made significant progress on the fire that’s burned about 70 square miles (181 square km) of mostly grasslands and farmland near the Nebraska-Kansas state line. It’s now estimated to be about 47% contained.They made the most of the opportunity Monday to dump water in dry creeks and draws filled with cottonwoods where dense fuels and brush has built up ahead of the return of more dangerous conditions expected on Tuesday, said Jonathan Ashford, spokesman for the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team.“It’s supposed to be about 20 degrees warmer tomorrow, lower humidity and increased wind,” he said Monday night.In Arizona, firefighters also took advantage of lighter winds to boost containment of a more than 33-square-mile (85 square-kilometer) blaze that has been burning outside of Flagstaff for more than a week. Strong winds that had fueled the fire are expected to return later this week. Meanwhile, hundreds of evacuated residents were given the go-ahead on Sunday to return home.About 160 firefighters, emergency management personnel and others — twice as many as the day before — were helping fight the fire in Nebraska by Monday evening.Known as the Road 702 Fire, it has destroyed at least six homes and threatened 660 others, along with 50 commercial or farm buildings, Ashford said.A retired Cambridge, Nebraska, fire chief who was helping as a fire spotter in Red Willow County died Friday night after his truck went off the road in a blinding haze of smoke and dust. The body of John Trumble, 66, of Arapahoe, was recovered around early Saturday.Trumble was the second person in a month to die while fighting a wildfire in southwest Nebraska. Elwood Volunteer Fire Chief Darren Krull, 54, was killed in a collision with a water tanker on April 7 in Furnas County as smoke cut visibility to zero.Nebraska remains critically dry, said Ashford, who urged residents to use caution when doing anything that could spark a fire.“The last thing we need is to have another fire started that we have to then fight,” he said.____Susan Montoya Bryan reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

(AP) — New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has signed emergency declarations as 20 wildfires continued to burn Sunday in nearly half of the state’s drought-stricken 33 counties.One wildfire in northern New Mexico that started April 6 merged with a newer fire Saturday to form the largest blaze in the state, leading to widespread evacuations in Mora and San Miguel counties. That fire was at 84 square miles (217 square kilometers) Sunday and 12% contained.An uncontained wind-driven wildfire in northern New Mexico that began April 17 had charred 81 square miles (209 square kilometers) of ponderosa pine, oak brush and grass by Sunday morning north of Ocate, an unincorporated community in Mora County.Meanwhile in Arizona, some residents forced to evacuate due to a wildfire near Flagstaff were allowed to return home Sunday morning.In Nebraska, authorities said wind-driven wildfires sweeping through parts of the state killed a retired Cambridge fire chief and injured at least 11 firefighters.Winds and temperatures in New Mexico diminished Saturday but remained strong enough to still fan fires. Dozens of evacuation orders remained in place.Fire officials were expecting the northern wildfires to slow Sunday as cloud and smoke cover moves in, allowing the forests to retain more moisture. But they added that the interior portions of the fires could show moderate to extreme behavior, which could threaten structures in those areas.More than 200 structures have been charred by the wildfires thus far and an additional 900 remain threatened, Lujan Grisham said.Fire management officials said an exact damage count was unclear because it’s still too dangerous for crews to go in and look at all the homes that have been lost.“We do not know the magnitude of the structure loss. We don’t even know the areas where most homes made it through the fire, where homes haven’t been damaged or anything like that,” said operation sections chief Jayson Coil.Some 1,000 firefighters were battling the wildfires across New Mexico, which already has secured about $3 million in grants to help with the fires.Lujan Grisham said she has asked the White House for more federal resources and she’s calling for a ban of fireworks statewide.“We need more federal bodies for firefighting, fire mitigation, public safety support on the ground in New Mexico,” she said. “It’s going to be a tough summer. So that’s why we are banning fires. And that is why on Monday I will be asking every local government to be thinking about ways to ban the sales of fireworks.”Wildfire has become a year-round threat in the West given changing conditions that include earlier snowmelt and rain coming later in the fall, scientist have said. The problems have been exacerbated by decades of fire suppression and poor management along with a more than 20-year megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change.In Arizona, two large wildfires continued to burn Sunday 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Prescott and 14 miles (22 kilometers) northeast of Flagstaff.Coconino County authorities lifted the evacuation order Sunday morning for residents living in neighborhoods along Highway 89 after fire management officials determined the Flagstaff-area wildfire no longer posed a threat.The fire near Flagstaff was at 33 square miles (85 square kilometers) as of Sunday with 3% containment. It forced the evacuation of 766 homes and burned down 30 homes and two dozen other structures since it began a week ago, according to county authorities.Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey declared the fire a state of emergency Thursday for Coconino County to free up recovery aid to affected communities.The wildfire near Prescott began last Monday and was at 4.8 square miles (12.4 square kilometers) and 15% contained as of Sunday morning as helicopters and air tankers dropped water and retardant to slow the fire’s growth.The cause of the wildfires in New Mexico and Arizona remain under investigation.Nebraska Emergency Management Agency officials said John P. Trumble, of Arapahoe, was overcome by smoke and fire after his vehicle left the road Friday night because of poor visibility from smoke and dust.Trumble, 66, was working with firefighters as a spotter in Red Willow County in the southwestern corner of the state and his body was found early Saturday, authorities said.Wildfires were still burning Saturday night in five Nebraska counties. The Nebraska National Guard deployed three helicopters and several support trucks to help battle the blazes."}, {"title": "Family Finds Out 'Odd' Snoring Noises Are 5 Bears Hibernating Under House", "text": "In a bit of a reverse Goldilocks scenario, a California family discovered that five bears had found their home just right.The South Lake Tahoe residents had been hearing “some odd rumbling, snoring-like noises” throughout the winter, but had been ignoring the mysterious sounds because they “simply didn’t make sense,” the BEAR League, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people coexist with bears, wrote on Facebook earlier this week. The neighbors even suggested they might be imagining things.But the sounds were very real, and there was a logical explanation: bears hibernating in the crawl space underneath the house.When the bears ― a mother and four young bears around a year old ― woke up, the human residents of the home “could no longer deny there was probably a bear under the house,” the group wrote.But even then, they didn’t suspect there were so many.“The residents didn’t realize there were five bears under their house until we got there and told the bears to come out... and then we counted five,” BEAR League Executive Director Ann Bryant told HuffPost in an email. “They had just thought it was one very noisy bear.”The BEAR League then “un-invited Mama Bear,” a process Bryant said involved “being territorial and scary, thereby making the bear believe it’s not going to be safe there anymore.” She emphasized that volunteers never physically hurt bears, though “sometimes we do hurt their feelings.”Once the mother was roused out of the crawl space, she called back to the cubs and they followed her out.After the ursine family vacated the crawl space, an “electrical barrier” was installed in the crawl space opening so any bears trying to get in will get a small shock. But Bryant added that prevention is the best defense against unwanted bear lodgers.“Each winter, about 100 to 150 of our bears attempt to hibernate under homes here at Tahoe,” she said. “The BEAR League is kept very busy moving bears out of these crawl spaces, often several bears each day.”Crawl spaces have “cave-like” openings that seem like a “vacancy sign” to bears looking to hibernate. But people can easily solve this problem by closing up those openings.“People really need to make sure their crawl space openings are closed and secured before bears go inside... especially in the fall, when they are looking for hibernation dens,” she said."}, {"title": "10 Missing After Underground Tremor At Coal Mine In Poland", "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A powerful underground tremor and methane gas discharge hit a second coal mine Saturday in southern Poland, forcing dozens of workers to flee the mine and leaving authorities unable to contact 10 other miners still missing, officials said.The accident at 3:40 a.m. Saturday at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine occurred 900 meters (2,950 feet) underground. It was the second colliery accident in just four days in the coal mining region around the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, near the Czech border.Repeated methane blasts since Wednesday at the nearby Pniowek mine have killed five miners, left seven miners and rescue workers missing and injured dozens of others. The search for those missing at Pniowek was suspended Friday after new blasts late Thursday injured seven rescue workers, some seriously.Both mines are operated by the Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa, or JSW, company.The company said 52 workers were in the area of the tremor Saturday at the Borynia-Zofiowka mine and 42 of them were able to leave the shaft on their own without injuries. A rescue operation was launched for the 10 missing miners.By late Saturday afternoon, rescue workers were 600 meters (yards) from the site of the tremor and advancing slowly toward where the missing were expected to be, the JSW company said. But it added that high levels of methane in the area could pose a danger and required caution from the rescue team.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Twitter that this was “devastating news again” from the mining region and said his prayers are with the missing and their relatives.Poland relies on its own coal and coal imports for almost 70% of its energy needs, drawing criticism from the European Union and environmental groups who are concerned about CO2 emissions and meeting climate change goals. Most Polish coal mines are in the southern Silesia region.The Polish government has been scaling down the use of coal and recently announced it would end coal imports from Russia by May, part of Poland’s drive to reduce its dependence on Russian energy in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine."}, {"title": "Maryland Becomes 2nd U.S. State To Ban Declawing Cats", "text": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed a bill into law this week making Maryland the second U.S. state to ban the declawing of cats.“Our beloved kitties, who cannot advocate for themselves, need us to protect them,” Democratic state Sen. Cheryl Kagan said in a statement from The Paw Project, a nonprofit dedicated to ending the declawing of cats.The new law, which goes into effect in October, prohibits veterinarians from performing the surgical procedure, unless it’s “necessary for a therapeutic purpose.” Those who violate it could face fines of up to $1,000.Declawing a cat is a major surgery that involves amputating the last bone of each toe, similar to amputating each first knuckle on a person’s hand. On top of the initial recovery pain and risk of infection, it can lead to lifelong pain as it alters the way that the cat walks.Some opponents of declawing bans have raised concerns they could lead to more cats being given up by people who don’t want the cats to scratch furniture, or who have concerns about the cats scratching people. However, research suggests that that declawing can lead to  worse behavioral issues. For instance, cats without claws can be more likely to bite if they feel threatened. Declawing can also lead to litter box problems, like urinating around the house, because cat litter can irritate declawed paws.The first U.S. state to ban declawing was New York, which did so in 2019. It’s also illegal in numerous other countries ― including much of Europe ― some Canadian provinces, and at the municipal level in some U.S. cities, including Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco, among others."}, {"title": "Finland Is On The Brink Of A Nuclear Power ‘Game Changer’", "text": "OLKILUOTO ISLAND, Finland ― From the outside, it looks like any other modern Nordic building rising several stories from a cleared swath of pine forest on this quiet, rural island off this country’s verdant southwest coast.But inside, hard-hatted workers are busy completing a feat of engineering that has never existed. It involves a robotic system and a basement network of switchbacking tunnels carved more than 1,300 feet into the Earth’s crust. Once finished, the project, called Onkalo, will turn the page to a new chapter of nuclear energy’s turbulent 80-year story and make history for the power plant just a two-minute drive down the road.In a matter of months, the machines inside this boxy gray building will begin a weekly routine that will continue for a century: placing highly radioactive gray cuboid rods into copper cylinders the length of a Lincoln Town Car. From there, the canisters will travel roughly two hours underground to crypts meant to keep the spent-fuel rods undisturbed for millennia in bedrock that geologists say hasn’t shifted in almost 2 billion years. Sealed twice over in bentonite clay ― which expands when wet, preventing water from seeping in and corroding the capsules, and offers stability in case of an earthquake ― this site is meant to entomb nuclear waste for as close to eternity as any human endeavor can guarantee.The project will store waste from the decades-old nuclear power complex next door. Last month, Finland switched on Olkiluoto-3, the third and biggest generator at the power station here. The reactor, one of the largest ever built and the first to open in Western Europe in at least 15 years, will produce about 14% of Finland’s electricity. Combined with the plant’s other two reactors, this speck of an island will provide 36% of the country’s power.On its own, the new reactor would be notable as a rare bullish bet on atomic power at a time when, despite the world’s attempts to slash climate-changing emissions and wean Europe off the fossil fuels financing Russia’s war machine, more countries have closed nuclear plants than have opened new ones. But Onkalo makes this the world’s first nuclear power plant that solves the problem of the toxic waste that has for years rendered humanity’s most reliable and efficient energy source politically radioactive across much of the globe.“This is a message from Finland that we have a solution to make nuclear power sustainable,” said Janne Mokka, the chief executive of Posiva Oy, the company building the storage site. “This gives certainty on what is the question of final disposal. It has never been done.”Yet it has been tried. The United States proposed building a permanent storage site in the Nevada desert at Yucca Mountain but canceled the project a decade later under pressure from Nevada politicians and Native Americans. France is digging its own facility, where it will store waste in clay. Sweden is working on an underground repository that mirrors Finland’s approach. Canada is also considering possible sites for its own.Nuclear energy has remained controversial across the rich world, even though it’s one of the safest forms of electricity generation, especially compared with fossil fuels that not only cause climate change but also lace the air with deadly disease-causing particles. Reactors are by far the most reliable source of electricity in existence, producing tremendous volumes of power 24/7 from relatively tiny nuggets of mined uranium, unlike solar panels and wind turbines that require vast operations and huge amounts of metal, and can prove less reliable in cloudy, windless weather. But nuclear power has very high upfront costs and the building process is slow. It’s also politically unpopular, in no small part because of the threat posed by radioactive waste.The United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency hailed Onkalo as a “game changer” for the nuclear industry when its officials toured the construction site in November 2020. Replicating the storage facility could prove tricky, particularly in the U.S., and some in the industry wonder if permanent burial is in fact the best answer to waste that still contains vast quantities of usable energy.But Finland is hoping to show the world how to preserve our climate and modern industrial society for future generations without saddling them with waste that remains dangerous for as many years as have passed since mammoths and early humans roamed the Ice Age tundra.More than a quarter-million tons of nuclear waste sits stored at power plants across the world.The U.S. alone has produced more than 85,000 metric tons of spent fuel since the 1950s. That may sound like a lot, but nuclear waste is heavy, and even that total is compact enough to fit on a single football field. Hardly the green glowing goo seen in cartoons, spent fuel comes out in hollow bundles of zirconium-alloy rods filled with gummy bear-sized pellets of enriched uranium. The country’s 93 remaining reactors, which generate just less than one-fifth of U.S. electricity, produce waste at a rate of about 2,000 tons per year. Spent fuel is stored across the country at about 80 sites, mostly at the same facilities as the reactors that produced the waste, either in container pools where rods are kept cool or in dry casks.A typical large reactor produces about 25 metric tons of high-level radioactive spent fuel per year. Finland has five large reactors.Nuclear reactors produce energy by splitting atoms of uranium in a process known as fission, where a neutron collides with an atom, splits it and releases huge volumes of energy in the form of heat and radiation. In a power plant, that heat is harnessed to turn water into steam, which spins turbines that generate electricity.Radiation is all around us all the time. It’s just energy moving through space, and it takes many forms, including ultraviolet light and radio transmission signals. Its effect on human health is measured by a metric called sieverts. One millisievert ― one-thousandth of a sievert ― is harmless. A banana contains 0.01 millisieverts. Uranium miners and nuclear plant workers receive an average annual dose of about 2 millisieverts, according to the World Nuclear Association data. A flight crew routinely taking the polar route from New York City to Tokyo takes in about 9 millisieverts per year. A single pelvic CT scan generally equates to a 10 millisievert dose. After exposure to 100 millisieverts, your chances of getting cancer may go up slightly.A single dose of 1,000 millisieverts is enough to induce nausea, vomiting and hemorrhaging. At least half the people in a group exposed to 5,000 millisieverts at once will die within a month. A short-term dose of 10,000 millisieverts is a death sentence within weeks.The average person receives 2.4 millisieverts per year from ambient radiation just from walking around, receiving low doses of radon and thoron in homes and buildings and from cosmic radiation. The average U.S. home exposes you to 228 times more radiation than living near a nuclear power plant, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.A decade after it’s removed from a reactor, nuclear waste can produce a dose of radiation of about 100,000 millisieverts per hour. But radiation decreases in half-lives over time. After about 1,000 years, waste decays back to the radioactive levels of its original mined ore, but keeping it isolated from the environment around it remains important to avoid irradiating plants and animals in the food chain. Onkalo is being built to last 100,000 years.Such timescales give any reasonable person pause.But nuclear power occupies a uniquely fear-inducing place in popular culture, goaded by images that range from the recklessly buffoonish nuclear plant operator Homer Simpson on “The Simpsons” — as well as his misanthropic boss, Mr. Burns — and scenes of skin-blistering agony in HBO’s “Chernobyl.”Ash from a coal-burning power plant, which contains radioactive materials and heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury that, unlike uranium, remain steadily toxic forever, spews 100 times more radiation into the surrounding area than a nuclear plant producing the same amount of energy. Radioactive minerals dredged up during gas drilling now contaminate communities across the U.S. The fine particles that burning fossil fuels spew into the air, meanwhile, caused 1 in 5 premature deaths worldwide in 2018 alone, according to a landmark Harvard University study, and increased the rates of diseases ranging from erectile dysfunction to dementia.Just 49% of U.S. adults said they favor nuclear power in a 2019 Gallup poll, down from a high of 62% in 2010. Overwhelming majorities of self-identified Democrats, women and those without college degrees opposed nuclear power. More Republicans than Democrats supported expanding nuclear power in a Pew Research Center survey from January. A plurality of U.S. adults, 35%, favored encouraging production of nuclear power, while 26% wanted the energy source discouraged and 37% said it should be neither encouraged nor discouraged. That made nuclear power slightly more popular than oil and gas drilling but far less supported than renewable energy production.That could also be a symptom of what the polling firm Bisconti Research, which frequently looks at public attitudes on atomic energy and has routinely found more favorable opinions than other surveys, calls a “perception gap” in which a majority of Americans judge public opinion of nuclear power to be less favorable than their own.In Finland, by contrast, about half the population of nearly 5.6 million supports expanding nuclear power while a quarter say the current level is appropriate, according to a 2021 poll from Finnish Energy ― a survey that, while conducted by an industry trade group, is widely trusted because it’s been ongoing for decades with the same questions. Just 18% of respondents supported reducing the current levels of nuclear power, down from more than 40% in previous decades.“Traditionally, Finns have been pretty pro-nuclear, and it’s a pro-technology, pro-engineering country,” said Tea Törmänen, a biologist and the executive director of the Finnish climate group RePlanet. “My guess is because the environmental conditions in Finland have always been so harsh, so we’ve had to rely on inventions, innovations and technology to survive.”She’s a member of the Green Party, which historically, in most Western countries, serves as a bastion of anti-nuclear advocacy. But even the Finnish chapter of Greenpeace, another vehemently anti-nuclear group in most nations, largely supports nuclear power.Building a permanent waste site has long enjoyed strong support among nuclear skeptics, Törmänen said.“When the final repository was decided on, the Greens, even though at the time they were opposing nuclear in general, they weren’t opposing the solution to the waste,” Törmänen said. “They thought, ‘We have these nuclear plants; we must deal with the waste responsibly.’ So there’s this allowance to be practical.”When Onkalo was first proposed, each municipality under consideration in Finland was consulted and given veto power. The small farming and fishing community that traditionally existed on Olkiluoto Island ultimately accepted the project, which it saw as a boon for tax revenue and jobs. Part of the benefit is that the island already hosted a nuclear power plant with dozens of employees, so most people in the area knew someone who worked there.In Rauma, the charming medieval town just a 20-minute drive south from Olkiluoto Island, residents walking the cobblestone streets late one afternoon seemed largely unconcerned about the new nuclear reactor and storage site less than 10 miles away.“It’s quite a safe place, and the regulations are there for a reason,” said Mikko Ammer, 39, a security worker at the nuclear plant. “If it’s done properly, it’s safe. And Onkalo is a huge part of that.”Nuclear power is “difficult” because of the waste it creates, said Aino Yrjölä, 17.“But maybe this solves the problem for the next generation,” she said of Onkalo.Leena Kiviranta, who said she was in her 30s, had more immediate concerns as she picked up a flattened cardboard milk carton from the ground.“I’m not worried about it at all,” she said of the nuclear projects. “I’d rather keep my energy on the sun and the spring, and I hope people would just be more natural and stop putting garbage on the street.”Those attitudes stand in stark contrast to the U.S. attempt to build a permanent storage site at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain. Federal officials selected the site in the desert roughly 150 miles northwest of Las Vegas against the protests of the Western Shoshone Nation, who complained that the facility, located on land used for decades as a nuclear testing site, was on their treaty territory. Farmers in the Amargosa Valley also raised concerns that the waste could leach into the water table and contaminate crops. The project was stalled for decades, but in 2002 the George W. Bush administration granted final approvals and underground testing began. Then in 2008, when the waste site finally applied for licensing from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the facility came up against the Obama administration, which had been skeptical. The final blow came in 2010, when Sen. Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was then the Senate majority leader, convinced the White House to abandon the project.Dealing with nuclear waste “takes political will, and that’s not something we have in abundance in our country right now,” said Gerald Frankel, a material scientist at Ohio State University who has long worked on the issue of waste disposal.In Nordic countries, including Finland and Sweden, he said, “what they have done is to embed people in the community and address concerns. The approach is to have consent-based siting and have community brought into the process. That’s not the way we have approached it in this country.”The sheer size of the U.S. raises the additional problem that waste would need to be transported across vast distances, raising the risk of an accident or terrorist attack along the way. But putting aside the lack of political will for even a single site, Congress designated Yucca Mountain as the sole location the U.S. could consider for first permanent storage in 1988, creating a legal logjam that prevents federal authorities from pursuing other options without changing the law. After the Obama administration halted Yucca Mountain, a federal commission convened to assess the country’s nuclear future recommended that the Department of Energy pursue a “consent-based” effort to find a new location for a repository. But so far it hasn’t done much. And in 2017, the Government Accountability Office issued a report finding that resuming the Yucca Mountain project would be difficult.“We’re basically in limbo,” Frankel said.Even as climate change and geopolitics broaden the appeal of nuclear plants, the energy source still struggles with high costs and long delays. This is in part the result of the industry’s hollowing-out over the past few decades, meaning the workforce and skilled knowledge on how to build highly technical and tightly regulated structures have shrunk, especially compared with Russia and China, where large plants continue to be built regularly.The lone nuclear reactor under construction in the U.S., Southern Co.’s Plant Vogtle in Georgia, hit even more delays in February, sending total costs surging past $30 billion and postponing electricity production until at least 2023. In the United Kingdom, the company building the only major reactor under construction, Hinkley Point C, also announced delays and cost increases.If new nuclear plants have a future in the U.S. and the Western world, it’s most likely as small, modular reactors. The technology already exists ― small reactors power military boats and submarines ― but a handful of startups in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are working on licensing commercial versions of the machines to serve as power plants. The projects are at various stages of completion and licensing. But as they come closer to commercial viability, a point analysts predict they will reach around 2030, they face a problem: Where to get fuel.Since the 1990s, Russia has been the primary source of enriched uranium for reactor fuel in the U.S., the result of a deal the Clinton administration made to boost the former U.S. rival’s economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unlike France, which produces the vast majority of its electricity from nuclear power and recycles a sizable portion of its waste, the U.S. does not reuse its spent fuel. (Finland and Sweden opted out of recycling in the 1970s because it was seen as too expensive and they had no use for the plutonium, a byproduct that can come from reenrichment, which is usually produced for nuclear weapons.)But small-reactor startups that want to sell their machines to, for example, the U.S. military to use on remote bases need to use what is called “unobligated uranium” ― essentially fuel that comes from domestic sources. Plans to build a new enrichment facility in Idaho fell through as cheap Russian uranium made the project too costly.Yet now, companies such as California-based Oklo Inc. are eyeing new ways to recycle spent fuel, which still retains up to 95% of its energy content even after it’s used.If that bet pays off, it makes investments in permanent storage sites underground less appealing, said Chris Gadomski, the lead nuclear analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF.“There’s a lot of discussion about recycling that fuel and burning it in advanced reactors … so my thinking on it is burying the fuel with all this energy content doesn’t make any sense at all, you might as well try to find a reactor that can burn it,” he said. “Why deposit an asset that has this much energy still available?”But reprocessing uranium produces plutonium, the even more deadly compound used in nuclear weapons. Increasing recycling, therefore, raises risks not only of contamination but also of more proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.“We have a slogan here: from rock to rock,” said Pasi Tuohimaa, Posiva’s head of communications. “Geologists would say we have bedrock that’s so old, that hasn’t moved in all of human history. What could be a safer place on Earth?”"}, {"title": "Twitter Bans Ads That Contradict Science On Climate Change", "text": "BERLIN (AP) — Twitter says it will no longer allow advertisers on its site who deny the scientific consensus on climate change, echoing a policy already in place at Google.“Ads shouldn’t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis,” the company said in a statement outlining its new policy Friday.There was no indication that the change would affect what users post on the social media site, which along with Facebook has been targeted by groups seeking to promote misleading claims about climate change.The announcement coinciding with Earth Day came hours before the European Union agreed a deal requiring big tech companies to vet their sites more closely for hate speech, disinformation and other harmful content.Twitter said it would provide more information in the coming months on how it plans to provide “reliable, authoritative context to the climate conversations” its users engage in, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The U.N.-backed science panel’s reports on the causes and effects of climate change provide the basis for international negotiations to curb climate change.The company already has a dedicated climate topic on its site and offered what it described as “pre-bunks” during last year’s U.N. climate conference to counter misinformation surrounding the issue."}, {"title": "How Nebraska's Governor Became A General In A Right-Wing War Against Biden’s Conservation Goal", "text": "Margaret Byfield wasn’t going to wait for actual information. She’d quickly concluded that the Biden administration’s goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30,” was a “massive federal land grab” in the making. What she needed now were soldiers for her opposition campaign. The more powerful, the better.Byfield, the executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, a fringe, right-wing organization that has ties to the fossil fuel industry and has become a magnet for anti-federal land zealots, would find her star in Nebraska Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts.Before long, American Stewards built a cozy relationship with Ricketts’ office — one that catapulted the Republican governor to the very top of a growing and successful anti-30x30 disinformation campaign.Internal communications HuffPost obtained via a public record request to Ricketts’ office show Byfield acting as a shadow adviser of the governor, not only on 30x30 but other environmental policy issues. She even played a direct role in crafting an executive order the governor signed in late June aimed at preventing President Joe Biden from implementing his 30x30 plan in Nebraska.One of the governor’s top aides, Taylor Gage, was in regular contact with Byfield between February and November of last year. The two kept one another abreast of their anti-30x30 efforts and shared materials ahead of a series of town halls the governor held around the state to “raise awareness about the threat 30x30 poses to our way of life here in Nebraska.” They also strategized about dealing with reporters and which media outlets could best help them get their message out.Byfield’s emails include language resembling what a top-ranking staffer might say: things like “we need to respond” and “I don’t think we need to comment on this.” At one point she acted as a liaison between Ricketts’ office and fellow 30x30 foe Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), requesting and apparently securing a statement from Ricketts in support of Boebert’s legislation aimed at blocking the Biden 30x30 pledge.On Friday, which is Earth Day, American Stewards will sponsor a “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska — what Byfield has described as “the most important conference” her group has ever organized. It will be a who’s who of land transfer proponents, climate change deniers, conservation foes and sympathizers of anti-government extremists.A release about the summit that went out last month boasted that it will “spoil environmentalist’s [sic] Earth Day” and “send the clear message that America’s landowners would not be ‘voluntarily’ surrendering their property rights to the environmental agenda.”Ricketts is hosting the event and will share the stage with Byfield, Boebert, Trump-era Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, anti-federal land Utah state Rep. Ken Ivory (R) and other leading figures of the anti-30x30 movement.The event’s sponsors include three of the nation’s fiercest proponents of climate change denialism — the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, The Heritage Foundation, and The Heartland Institute — and Protect the Harvest, a pro-agriculture, anti-animal rights group founded by oil tycoon Forrest Lucas.Lucas and Protect the Harvest played an outsized role in securing President Donald Trump’s pardons for Dwight Lincoln Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, the father-son Oregon ranchers whose arson conviction sparked the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.Byfield, Ricketts’ office and Gage, who is now executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party, did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.And American Stewards was selective about which media can attend the “most important conference” in its history: The organization denied HuffPost credentials to cover it.Biden’s 30x30 target is in line with a proposed United Nations framework for protecting biodiversity amid the deepening extinction and climate crises, and has growing support within the global scientific community.A week after taking office, Biden followed through on a campaign promise and set 30x30 as a national goal. His executive order established a process for engaging with a broad range of stakeholders, from states and Native American tribes to farmers and anglers, to get input about how best to achieve the 30% target. (Approximately 12% of all U.S. lands are now permanently protected, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.)There is absolutely nothing to suggest the plan, which the administration has since branded “America the Beautiful,” will involve confiscating property or deceptive tactics to gain control of private land. In an initial report outlining its vision for protecting and restoring 30% of lands and waters by the end of the decade, the Biden administration committed to “collaboration, support for voluntary and locally led conservation and honoring of Tribal sovereignty and private property rights.”The overall lack of detail in Biden’s initial directive, however, allowed paranoia and conspiratorial thinking to permeate conservative circles. Almost immediately, American Stewards labeled 30x30 a “land grab” and warned its audience that the Biden initiative “hands the powers of the Federal regulatory agencies to a movement that has been working to abolish private property for decades.”Within weeks, Ricketts would be a top soldier in the anti-30x30 movement.According to the documents obtained by HuffPost, American Stewards began to communicate with Ricketts’ staffer within weeks of Biden’s order. On Feb. 17, 2021, Byfield received an email from Tanya Storer, a rancher and commissioner in rural Cherry County, Nebraska, who’d recently asked her to help fight a proposed conservation easement at a private ranch in the area.Storer informed Byfield that she’d recently discussed the 30x30 initiative with her “friend” and “colleague” Gage, then the governor’s director of strategic communications, and wanted to introduce the two of them so they could coordinate a time for Byfield to sit down with Ricketts. “I am anxious for the two of you to visit,” Storer wrote.In a response the following day, Byfield expressed her interest in briefing Ricketts on Biden’s “very concerning” effort. She declared that the president’s team had been “populated by the extreme faction of the environmental movement.” And she shared materials with Gage that her small nonprofit had put together on 30x30, including “fact sheets” and model resolutions that local governments could pass to oppose the program.“We believe States and local governments need to speak out against this,” Byfield wrote to Gage. “Land ownership and management should not be dictated from Washington, D.C., but should be determined at the local level.”Byfield met with Ricketts at the state capitol in Lincoln on March 10, emails show. And soon after, Ricketts was publicly echoing Byfield’s “land grab” rhetoric and other anti-30x30 talking points.“When the agriculture secretary [Tom Vilsack] says it’s not a land grab, then you know it is a land grab,” Ricketts told a crowd at one of his anti-30x30 town hall meetings back in June. Projected on a screen behind him was an image of a remote road beneath storm clouds and the words “30x30 LAND GRAB.” It was taken straight from American Stewards’ website.American Stewards of Liberty was formed in 2009, but it has its roots in the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement that started in the 1970s and sought to remove lands from federal control. One of its precursors is Stewards of the Range, which was established in 1992 to defend Byfield’s father, Nevada rancher and sagebrush rebel Wayne Hage, who battled with the Forest Service for years over unpermitted grazing on public lands — a prequel of sorts to the armed standoff at Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s ranch that gave rise to an extremist militia movement.American Stewards is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The majority of its revenue comes from donations, major gifts, and income from trainings, speaking fees and consulting contracts with local governments. Between 2015 and 2019, Kane County, Utah, paid the organization $483,000 for land-use consulting and legal services, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Over that same five-year period, Donors Capital Fund and Donors Trust, two groups that received millions from the fossil fuel moguls Charles and David Koch and have funneled huge amounts of dark money to climate change denial and other conservative causes, gave American Stewards at least $170,000, according to the Center for Media and Democracy.Byfield and her husband are the organization’s only full-time employees. In 2019, the most recent year for which tax information is available, their combined salaries accounted for $192,381 of a total of $308,647 in spending.On its website, the organization says it is “dedicated to protecting private property rights, defending the use of our land, and restoring local control.” In the past, fulfilling that mission has largely consisted of consulting at the county level on land management issues, working to get imperiled species removed from the federal endangered species list and contesting environmental rules.But when Biden dropped his 30x30 plan in early 2021, the group latched on and didn’t let go. It has fought the conservation target with a blend of misinformation, conspiracy theories and fear-mongering, as the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities exhaustively detailed in a report earlier this week. Some have questioned if the group’s anti-30x30 campaign flouts federal rules for tax-exempt nonprofits.At a recent appearance before the San Juan County Commission in New Mexico, Byfield declared that private land is a “major target” of 30x30 and that “the ultimate goal is to eliminate use of the land.”Other rhetoric has been completely outlandish. At one of her anti-30x30 training sessions in South Dakota, Byfield promptly agreed when an attendee compared 30x30 to the Holodomor, a man-made famine that occurred in Ukraine during Soviet Union dictator Josef Stalin’s rule and resulted in the deaths of an estimated 3.9 million people.At that same event, Trent Loos, a Nebraska rancher and radio show host who served on former President Donald Trump’s agricultural advisory committee and now helps American Stewards with its campaign, compared 30x30 to Nazi Germany.And in its guide on how states, counties and local landowners can fight 30x30, American Stewards claims that “there is no credible scientific reasoning or facts that support the need to preserve any specific amount of land to ‘cure’ climate change.”Ricketts parroted that claim in a June interview with conservative radio host Dana Loesch, saying 30x30 is “not based on any science or data.”The world’s premier climate research body disagrees. In a sweeping report on climate impacts and vulnerability earlier this year, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that “maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas.”In many ways, American Stewards’ opposition push has already been a huge success. The group stoked fear in rural communities across the West and Midwest, elevating its own brand in the process. It convinced dozens of local government bodies to pass its prefabricated resolutions opposing 30x30: To date, more than 130 counties and other localities across 13 states have adopted the model resolutions, according to a tally on American Stewards’ website.And a growing number of Republican lawmakers and allied right-wing organizations are peddling the group’s talking points and working to drum up opposition.But few have proven themself a bigger champion of the cause than Ricketts. Center for Western Priorities dubbed him “the political hub of 30x30 disinformation.”In early April, about a month after Byfield briefed Ricketts at the state Capitol, she checked in with Gage, her contact in the governor’s office, to see how the letter he was spearheading against 30x30 was coming along. In an email to Gage, Byfield noted that she was going to be holding anti-30x30 events in Oklahoma, Montana and South Dakota in the coming weeks and offered to lend a hand if Gage needed to secure signatures from the governors of those states.While the emails do not indicate that Gage took her up on that offer or that Byfield was involved in crafting the opposition letter, they do show that Byfield had advance knowledge of Ricketts’ actions.“Governors have been responding positively,” Gage wrote. “I expect the final letter by April 16th.”A couple of weeks later, on April 21, Gage sent Byfield the finalized letter that Ricketts and 14 other Republican governors, including those from Oklahoma, Montana and South Dakota, had sent to Biden. In it, the group outlined their concerns and speculated that 30x30 would violate private property rights and damage local economies.Byfield praised the letter and thanked Ricketts for his leadership. She also informed Gage that she’d spoken earlier that day with a Fox News reporter who was pitching a story on 30x30 and offered to send the journalist the governors’ letter and Gage’s contact information.“Go for it!” Gage replied. “We’d be happy to go on Fox News to discuss.”Later that day, Byfield emailed the Fox reporter to connect him with Gage, who she described as “very well versed on 30x30.” When the reporter hadn’t reached out to Ricketts’ staff a week later, Byfield pondered “if it would be worthwhile to have some op-eds ready to go regardless of the direction of the story.”“Thinking we should try to take advantage of the national spotlight,” she told Gage.“I agree - we would be happy to team up on an op-ed,” Gage replied.The two brainstormed which outlets to target, including Fox News and The Wall Street Journal, but HuffPost could find no record of Ricketts publishing an opinion in either publication. He did, however, publish at least five columns about 30x30. The columns are circulated to all Nebraska papers and often get published.It wasn’t the only time that Byfield and Gage brainstormed media strategy. When a reporter from the Omaha World-Herald reached out to Byfield in early June to ask about her organization’s view of the Sagebrush Rebellion and the Bundy family’s government resistance, Byfield pinged Gage to ask if the reporter was “honest” and worth talking to.“I would just provide him written comment at this point,” Gage advised. “If he follows up again, we can visit further.”Byfield took his advice.It was around that same time in June that a reporter at the Daily Beast contacted the governor’s team to inquire about its relationship with American Stewards. Ricketts’ office pretended it had little if any knowledge of the right-wing group. “Reached for comment, Ricketts’ office requested more information on American Stewards,” the Daily Beast reported.By then, Gage had been consulting with American Stewards’ executive director about 30x30 for nearly four months. He’d already invited Byfield to speak on a panel about 30x30 at a 2-day agricultural summit the governor would host the following month — an invitation that Byfield promptly accepted. And Byfield was already pulling strings in the governor’s office to advance her own agenda.This influence is particularly clear in Ricketts’ executive order on 30x30 — the first of its kind in any state.In an email on May 27, Byfield flagged language in an order from Interior Secretary Deb Haaland that directed members of a newly created climate task force to collaborate and coordinate with states and local authorities. Byfield stressed that the provision could be a “powerful tool” for Nebraska to fight 30x30 and suggested a coordination provision be included in Ricketts’ upcoming executive order.When Gage circulated a “confidential one pager” in early June, Byfield drew attention to a Nebraska statute that requires all conservation and preservation easements to receive approval from the local county board or other appropriate government body. And she suggested the governor task the director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture with making sure the U.S. Department of Agriculture was aware of requirements under state law.“We may even consider providing some recommended language for this,” she wrote.Ricketts’ executive order on 30x30, signed on June 24, has Byfield’s fingerprints all over it. The directive instructs the Nebraska Department of Revenue to “advise counties of their rights in reviewing conservation easements” pursuant to the statute Byfield underscored in her email. It designates Nebraska’s agricultural director as the state coordinator for the federal climate task force that Haaland established in her secretarial order. And it directs the state agriculture director to “coordinate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure that the USDA is seeking proper local approvals for conservation easements” related to federal programs.Byfield was present at the signing ceremony.After months of backroom collaboration, the governor’s relationship with American Stewards became increasingly public. In September, Ricketts interviewed Byfield for a full hour on his podcast. Among other things, the two argued that an Interior Department fact sheet on 30x30 had lifted statistics — including that 1 million species are now at risk of extinction and that the U.S. is losing a football field-sized area of nature to development every 30 seconds — from a 2019 Center for American Progress report. (The extinction statistic is from a United Nations report. The loss of nature estimate is from a report that the Center for American Progress commissioned but that was conducted by Conservation Science Partners, a California-based science nonprofit.)“If they were writing a high school paper, they would have gotten a D for plagiarism,” chuckled Ricketts, whose public comments and writings have repeatedly mirrored those of American Stewards.Byfield and Gage remained in close contact through November. Then, suddenly, communication between the governor’s office and American Stewards stopped, according to records provided to HuffPost. When pressed about whether the governor’s office had complied with HuffPost’s requested date range, an adviser to the governor responded, “I presume the break in communication was likely due the resignation of Taylor Gage, Strategic Communications Specialist, on Dec. 3, 2021.”Gage was undoubtedly Byfield’s primary contact in Ricketts’ office. Still, internal emails indicate that Byfield and the governor’s office had started strategizing off-email long before Gage’s departure out of concern that their discussions could be made public via a records request.Byfield warned Gage about a watchdog group, Accountable.US, that had been filing records requests for American Stewards’ communications with counties in numerous states — “Your office may receive a similar request,” she wrote — and scrutinizing the group’s tax status. Accountable.US filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service in May accusing the group of violating its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by lobbying against 30x30 at the federal, state and local levels.In another back-and-forth in September, Gage flagged a USDA announcement about $75 million in investments for climate-smart agriculture and forestry projects on private lands, including one in Nebraska.“We need to respond...,” Byfield wrote. “Have several thoughts of what needs to go into this, but they are strategic and should not be subject to a [Freedom of Information Act] request. We could either visit by phone, or, loop in an attorney for the state so we trigger the attorney client privilege. Thoughts?”“Would you have time for a Zoom next week?” Gage asked."}, {"title": "Crews Brace For Strong Winds, Explosive Fire Growth In West", "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Firefighters fanned out across blackened landscape in Arizona’s high country, digging into the ground to put out smoldering tree stumps and roots as helicopters buzzed overhead with buckets of water to drop on a massive blaze.The work has been tedious and steady — all with the recognition that already strong winds will become stronger Friday and a shift over the weekend could turn the blaze back toward a mountainous tourist town.The 32-square-mile (83-square kilometer) blaze outside Flagstaff is one of a half-dozen major wildfires that have raced across Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado over the past week. Forecasters have warned that above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation combined with spring winds have elevated the chances for more catastrophic fires.The elements needed for critical fire weather are “pretty much on steroids in the atmosphere for tomorrow,” said Scott Overpeck with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque. “And by that we mean they are really cranked up. Everything is really overlapping together at the same time.”Red flag warnings were issued Thursday for much of northern Arizona and large portions of New Mexico as state and federal officials scrambled to get more crews on the front lines.With expected wind conditions, “it will prove challenging to put in those containment lines to stop fire growth,” said Jerolyn Byrne, a spokesperson for the team working the Flagstaff-area fire. “We’ll see some growth on the fire.”Neither officials nor residents have been able to fully survey the damage near Flagstaff, as crews on Thursday were busy wrestling a spot fire and trying to keep the flames from running up the mountainside. If that were to happen, it would mean a much bigger fire with long-term consequences such as erosion and flooding.Still, spirits were lifted Thursday as helicopters for the first time were able to start dropping water on the flames.Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Flagstaff’s Coconino County. The declaration clears the way for state funding to be used for evacuations, shelter, repairs and other expenses. However, the money can’t be used to reimburse home and business owners for their losses.Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of wildfires burning in the Southwest. Popular lakes and national monuments have been closed in Arizona — some because fire has moved directly over them. Local and federal land managers also have been imposing burn bans and fire restrictions on public lands.Wildfire has become a year-round threat in the West given changing conditions that include earlier snowmelt and rain coming later in the fall, scientist have said. The problems are exacerbated by decades of fire suppression and poor forest management along with a more than 20-year megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change.Residents around Flagstaff questioned how a small blaze reported northeast of the college town Sunday afternoon ballooned to more than 30 square miles (77 square kilometers) in a matter of days. Matt McGrath, a district ranger on the Coconino National Forest, said firefighters had corralled the wildfire Sunday and didn’t see any smoke or active flames when they checked on it again Monday.By Tuesday, the wind was firmly in control. Flames emerged and jumped the containment line.The cause of the fire is under investigation.Smoldering stumps dotted the area where the fire was believed to have started.Preston Mercer, a fire management specialist with the Coconino National Forest, remembers standing on the same patch of ground in 2010, fighting another large blaze. Like that one, this fire has been taking advantage of dry vegetation and fierce winds.“The environment is not very friendly. It was blowing 70 mph. Rocks were hitting everybody in the face. It was very smoky and we were working directly in the heat,” he said of the conditions this week. “These guys are working incredibly hard. They know the values at risk. This is their community.”In neighboring New Mexico, crews were battling several fires, including two that had forced a small number of evacuations and one that was threatening natural gas and telecommunication lines.The fire danger also remained high in southern Colorado, where a wildfire destroyed an unknown number of homes on Wednesday in Monte Vista, a community of about 4,150 people surrounded by farm fields. Despite strong winds, firefighters stopped the fire from spreading by the evening but hot spots remained.Officials there said they were still assessing the damage Thursday but noted that six families had been displaced by the fire.About 25 structures have been lost in the Flagstaff-area fire. Coconino County officials late Wednesday pointed residents to a system where they could seek help with food, temporary housing and other needs. Some 765 homes were evacuated.Rocky Opliger, the incident commander on a wildfire that has burned about 3 square miles (7 square kilometers) and forced evacuations south of Prescott, Arizona, said the conditions are some of the worst he’s seen in nearly five decades of fighting wildland fires.“This is very early to have this kind of fire behavior,” he said. “Right now we are on the whims of weather.”____Associated Press writers Paul Davenport in Phoenix, Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, and Colleen Slevin in Denver contributed to this report."}, {"title": "This Earth Day, Biden Faces 'Headwinds' On Climate Agenda", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — One year ago, Joe Biden marked his first Earth Day as president by convening world leaders for a virtual summit on global warming that even Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping attended. Biden used the moment to nearly double the United States’ goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, vaulting the country to the front lines in the fight against climate change.But the months since then have been marred by setbacks. Biden’s most sweeping proposals remain stalled on Capitol Hill despite renewed warnings from scientists that the world is hurtling toward a dangerous future marked by extreme heat, drought and weather.In addition, the war in Ukraine has reshuffled the politics of climate change, leading Biden to release oil from the nation’s strategic reserve and encourage more drilling in hopes of lowering sky-high gas prices that are emptying American wallets.It’s a far cry from the sprint toward clean energy that Biden — and his supporters — envisioned when he took office. Although Biden is raising fuel economy standards for vehicles and included green policies in last year’s bipartisan infrastructure legislation, the lack of greater progress casts a shadow over his second Earth Day as president.Biden will mark the moment in Seattle on Friday, where he’ll be joined by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat with a national reputation for climate action. Biden also is scheduled to visit Portland on Thursday as part of a swing through the Pacific Northwest, a region that has often been on the forefront of environmental efforts.Administration officials defend Biden’s record on global warming while saying that more work is needed.“Two things can be true at the same time,” said Ali Zaidi, the president’s deputy national climate adviser. “We can have accomplished a lot, and have a long way to go.”Zaidi acknowledged that “we have headwinds, we have challenges,” but also said the president has “a mandate to drive action forward on this.”Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, said Biden has not lived up to the promise of last year’s Earth Day summit.“Climate action was a pillar of President Biden’s campaign, and his promises on this existential issue were a major reason the public elected him,″ Tisdel said. ”Achieving results on climate is not a matter of domestic politics, it’s life and death.”Biden had hoped to pass a $1.75 trillion plan for expanding education programs, social services and environmental policies. But Republicans opposed the legislation, known as Build Back Better, and it  failed to get the unanimous support necessary from Democrats  holding a slim majority in the Senate.The final blow came from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who owes his personal fortune to coal and represents a state that defines itself in large part through mining that fossil fuel. Democrats hope to revive the bill in some form, but it’s unclear exactly what Manchin would support, putting any possible deal in jeopardy.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that negotiations were ongoing even though Biden wasn’t publicizing them. “Just because he’s not talking about it doesn’t mean those conversations are not happening behind the scenes,” she said.Administration officials are expected to speak Saturday at a rally outside the White House as climate, labor and social justice groups urge Congress to pass climate legislation before Memorial Day. Similar events are planned in dozens of cities as activists stress the need for major investments to boost clean energy and create jobs.The White House wants to win approval for more than $300 billion in tax credits for clean energy that advocates describe as crucial for meeting Biden’s goal of reducing emissions by up to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030.Without the tax credits, “I don’t see a pathway,” said Nat Keohane, a former Obama energy adviser who is now president of the independent Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Reaching the midterm elections in November without them “would amount to a failure on the promise of the first year,″ he said.Asked if Biden’s goal of reducing emissions is still achievable, Psaki said, “We are continuing to pursue it, and we are going to continue to do everything we can to reach it.”Psaki noted that the  $1 trillion infrastructure law includes an array of climate policies, including funding for the construction of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. However, an analysis by the consultancy McKinsey estimates that nearly 30 million chargers are needed by 2030.The Ukraine war has worsened the political challenges at home by sending shockwaves through global energy markets and increasing gas prices.It’s also caused Biden to change his tune on oil drilling. Last week, Biden moved forward with the first onshore sales of oil and gas drilling leases  on public land, a move that environmental groups blasted even though the administration said it was only doing so under a court order.Although the legal battle is ongoing, in the meantime Biden is encouraging new domestic production.“The bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now,” Biden said in March.The leasing plan \"is an ugly betrayal of Joe Biden’s campaign promises and his administration’s rhetoric on environmental justice and climate action,″ said Collin Rees, U.S. political director at Oil Change International.“Biden is choosing to stand with polluters over people at the expense of frontline communities and the future of the planet,\" he added.The war in Ukraine has also frustrated diplomatic efforts to address climate change.John Kerry, Biden's international climate envoy, has focused much of his efforts on prodding China, the world's top consumer of coal, to transition to clean energy more quickly. But that work “is harder now” amid China's defense of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Kerry said Wednesday.“Some of the differences in opinion between our countries have sharpened and hardened, and that makes diplomacy more difficult,” he said during an online discussion on climate finance with the Center for Global Development.Kerry's aides have downplayed talk he might leave the administration now that he's served more than a year, and he remains a loyal defender of Biden's climate efforts. But his tone has become more pessimistic recently, especially as Biden's climate proposals remain stalled in Congress.The administration was also rattled by recent reports that Biden's domestic climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, plans to step down. McCarthy called the reports “simply inaccurate” and said she is “excited about the opportunities ahead.”Another one of Biden's climate-related efforts could divide the environmental community. His administration plans to offer $6 billion in funding to prevent financially distressed nuclear power plants from closing. Although the facilities produce carbon-free electricity, they’re viewed warily by some activists because of concerns about how to dispose of nuclear waste and the potential for devastating accidents.“We’re using every tool available to get this country powered by clean energy by 2035,\" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice, said that “spirits have dimmed” after the failures of the past year. Although she praised some of the policies that Biden has achieved so far, she said that “it’s not at the scale of climate action we need — full-stop.\"Now Republicans are poised to retake control of at least one chamber in Congress in November's midterm elections, meaning there's a limited window for making progress. Dillen and some other activists have suggested that Biden declare a climate emergency and use the Defense Production Act to boost renewable energy.\"It’s time to pull out all the stops,″ she said.___Associated Press writers Josh Boak and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report."}, {"title": "'Wall Of Fire' Forces Evacuations Near Arizona Tourist Town", "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Heavy winds kicked up a towering wall of flames outside a northern Arizona tourist town Tuesday, ripping through two-dozen structures and sending residents of more than 700 homes scrambling to flee.Flames as high as 100 feet (30 meters) raced through an area of scattered homes, dry grass and Ponderosa pine trees on the outskirts of Flagstaff as wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 kph) pushed the blaze over a major highway.Coconino County officials said during an evening news conference that 766 homes and 1,000 animals had been evacuated. About 250 structures remained threatened in the area popular with hikers and off-road vehicle users and where astronauts have trained amid volcanic cinder pits.The county declared an emergency after the wildfire ballooned from 100 acres (40 hectares) Tuesday morning to over 9 square miles (23 square kilometers) by evening, and ash rained from the sky. The fire was moving northeast away from the more heavily populated areas of Flagstaff, home to Northern Arizona University, and toward Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, said Coconino National Forest spokesman Brady Smith.“It’s good in that it’s not headed toward a very populated area, and it’s headed toward less fuel,” Smith said. “But depending on the intensity of the fire, fire can still move across cinders.”Authorities won’t be able to determine whether anyone was injured in the wildfire until the flames subside. Firefighters and law enforcement officers went door to door telling people to evacuate but had to pull out to avoid getting boxed in, said Coconino County Sheriff Jim Driscoll.He said his office got a call about a man who was trapped inside his house, but firefighters couldn’t get to him.“We don’t know if he made it out or not,” Driscoll said.Various organizations worked to set up shelters for evacuees and animals, including goats and horses.The scene was all too familiar for residents who recalled rushing to pack their bags and flee a dozen years ago when a much larger wildfire burned in the same area.“This time was different, right there in your backyard,” said Kathy Vollmer, a resident.She said she and her husband grabbed their three dogs but left a couple of cats behind as they faced what she described as a “wall of fire.”“We just hope they are going to be OK,” she said.Earlier in the day, the wildfire shut down U.S. 89, the main route between Flagstaff and far northern Arizona, and communities on the Navajo Nation. The high winds grounded aircraft that could drop water and fire retardant on the blaze.Arizona Public Service Co., the state’s largest utility, shut off power to about 625 customers to keep firefighters safe, a spokeswoman said.About 200 firefighters were battling the flames, but more are expected as a top-level national management team takes over later this week.The fire started Sunday afternoon 14 miles (22 kilometers) northeast of Flagstaff. Investigators don’t know yet what caused it and have yet to corral any part of the blaze.Ali Taranto rushed to Flagstaff from Winslow, where she works at a hospital, on Tuesday to check on a property she owns that was threatened by the wildfire. She also was getting messages to check on a neighbor who she found didn’t have access to oxygen while the power was out and didn’t have the strength to manually open her garage door to evacuate.Taranto said the neighbor was “disoriented and gasping for air” when she reached her. Firefighters in the area helped get the garage door open and the neighbor to the hospital, she said. Taranto was looking for a shelter for the neighbor’s two dogs.By the time Taranto left the area, the highway into Flagstaff was shut down and she had to drive an extra two hours back home. At least two other neighbors didn’t evacuate, she said.“To see flames several yards away from your property line and to hear the propane tanks bursting in the background, it was very surreal,” Taranto said. “Ash falling down. It was crazy.”The wind is expected to be a challenge the rest of the week, along with warmer-than-average weather and low humidity, the National Weather Service said.“I don’t see any significant decreases in wind, I don’t see any big bump ups in humidity and, at this point, we’re not really expecting any precipitation either,” said meteorologist Robert Rickey.Red flag warnings blanketed much of Arizona and New Mexico on Tuesday, indicating conditions are ripe for wildfires. Residents in northern New Mexico’s Mora and San Miguel counties were warned to be ready to evacuate as wildfires burned there amid dry, warm and windy conditions.The National Interagency Fire Center reported Tuesday that nearly 2,000 wildland firefighters and support personnel were assigned to more than a dozen large wildfires in the Southwestern, Southern and Rocky Mountain areas. Scientists say climate change has made the U.S. West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.Elsewhere in Arizona, firefighters battled a wildfire in a sparsely populated area of the Prescott National Forest, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Prescott.Cory Carlson, the incident commander with the Prescott National Forest, said late Tuesday afternoon the high winds have been the biggest challenge, sending embers into the air that sparked new spot fires near State Route 261, along with the demand for crews at other fires.“We do have a lack of resources,” he said. “There’s a lot of fires in the region.”Some areas were evacuated, and a shelter was set up at Yavapai College. Carlson appealed to residents to abide by evacuation orders.The cause of the 600-acre (2.4 square-kilometer) wildfire was under investigation.In southern Arizona, a principal highway route between Bisbee and Sierra Vista reopened Tuesday after being closed for about eight hours due to a brush fire in the hills overlooking Bisbee.___Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix, Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Nearly 30% Of Americans Aren't Worried 'At All' About The Deadly Climate Crisis", "text": "In an international survey of people’s responses to the climate crisis and other pressing issues, the country with the highest percentage of people who say they’re not worried about climate change “at all” turned out to be the United States.A survey released Monday by Ipsos found that about half of adults (48%) across 31 countries worry at least a fair amount about climate change.The survey of more than 23,000 adults worldwide, conducted online from mid-February to early March, asked people to what extent they’d worried about climate change in the past few weeks: a great deal, a fair amount, a little, or not at all?In Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Italy, more than two-thirds of respondents said they’d worried about climate change a great deal or a fair amount recently. In China and Russia, fewer than 30% said so. And in the United States, some 38% said they worried at least a fair amount about the climate crisis.However, 29% of Americans surveyed said they didn’t worry “at all” about climate change — a higher percentage than in any of the 30 other countries.Meanwhile, the climate crisis, which is very much real, is still ravaging the U.S. and other nations, bringing deadly — and worsening — droughts, fires, extreme heat, storms and floods.Last year alone, we saw the hottest July ever recorded on the planet (again), the largest single wildfire in California history (again), and devastating hurricanes and flooding along the Gulf of Mexico and the United States’ Eastern Seaboard (again).In the Ipsos survey, nearly three-quarters of Americans said that government (73%), businesses (73%) and individuals (71%) have a responsibility to reduce fossil fuel emissions to help avert the worst of the climate crisis. Over 60% said we need to act now, or we risk failing future generations (something the United Nations agrees with).Yet only about a quarter of American respondents believed the government has a clear plan to tackle the climate crisis."}, {"title": "Cannabis Insiders Still High On Pot Business On 4/20 Despite Ongoing Challenges", "text": "Although many cannabis consumers will be smoking the wacky weed on 4/20, industry insiders will mark the honorary holiday by focusing on a different kind of green ― or at least doing what’s needed to stay in business.This year marks the 10th anniversary of when Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational cannabis in the U.S.Since then, 16 other states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational purposes. Currently, medical marijuana is legal in 37 states and Washington, D.C., but five states have only legalized the use of CBD oil: Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky and Wisconsin.Considering cannabis laws vary from state to state and it is still illegal on the federal level, it’s not surprising that political issues top the list of challenges industry insiders face.Elliot Lewis, founder and CEO of Catalyst Cannabis, which operates a number of dispensaries in Southern California, says that politicians in his state aren’t doing enough to help the industry.“The leaders in [Sacramento] are greedy pigs,” Lewis said, adding that they could “care less about an industry” that he says could easily produce another 300,000 jobs.In particular, he noted the high state and local taxes placed on consumers and businesses. Those can add as much as $38 to $100 worth of legal weed, according to KCRW.com.Things are even more challenging on the federal level, where cannabis remains illegal.Matte Namer, the CEO and founder of Cannabeta Realty, a commercial real estate brokerage firm on the East Coast specializing in cannabis, says the current political climate doesn’t seem favorable to decriminalizing pot or legalizing it.“The Senate simply does not appear to have 50 votes let alone the 60 votes required to override a filibuster,” Namer told HuffPost via email. “We are hopeful that [the SAFE Banking Act] (which would give the cannabis industry much greater access to banking) may pass the Senate this year, however, politicians and activists are very divided as to whether any cannabis legislation should be passed that does not significantly advance issues of social justice.”Matt Costa, CEO of Wonderbrett, a Los Angeles-based cannabis company, agrees that the government needs to emphasize helping people and communities negatively affected by the war on drugs.“Although we cannot reverse the decades of injustice waged on Americans, and in particular communities of color, releasing and expungement of all incarcerated is necessary,” Costa told HuffPost in an email. “More importantly, providing thoughtful and obtainable resources to truly help restore the affected is what’s needed, because their sentences don’t really end after getting out of prison.”Costa says the industry should provide licensing opportunities, job training and various other forms of aid to those marginalized for decades, but added that there have to be “significant bills” that truly help these communities. “And that is just the start.”As Namer mentioned, banking is a key issue for the industry. Most banks don’t want to involve themselves in a business considered illegal at the federal level, which makes it hard for pot businesses to get access to capital.“For goodness sake it is 2022. The fact that we still can’t legally bank is unacceptable,” Barry Walker, CEO of Tradecraft Farms in California, griped to HuffPost. “Yes, [the SAFE Banking Act] has passed in the House several times before but we feel like there is momentum this time. Or maybe I just tell myself that so I can sleep at night.”Surprisingly, gas prices aren’t as big of an issue for many “cannabusinesses.”Tim Shaw, chief operating officer of MariMed, a multistate cannabis operator, says he’s surprised that the price of gas is having “a negligible impact” on production.“We thought higher gas prices might impact dispensary traffic because people may be driving less, but we haven’t seen that yet,” he told HuffPost.However, Jesus Burrola, the CEO of POSIBL, a cannabis farm in Salinas, California, says consumer price hikes are coming.“We have already seen distribution and last mile deliveries adjust their rates as a result of gas prices, and have also seen increases in construction materials that are over 30%,” Burrola said. “This will eventually have an effect on consumer prices.”But while the marijuana market is still growing big, insiders say it’s a long way off before dispensaries become as ubiquitous as 7-Elevens and McDonald’s in the U.S.“It will be a long time before there is a dispensary on every corner. Probably decades,” Walker told HuffPost. “In the meantime companies like ours write very good policy and introduce it to city councils and hope that they will adopt or negotiate some sort of legal cannabis policy.”Steven Jung, chief operating officer of the vaporizer company PAX, says the priority should be on consumer access.“What we really need to be focused on right now is ensuring that consumers actually have access to legal cannabis,” he told HuffPost. “That’s not the case everywhere, particularly in large markets like California, where we’re seeing cannabis deserts and the resulting sustainment of the illicit market.”Luke Anderson, co-founder of Cann, a THC-infused beverage, said the long-term prognosis looks good for the industry, but there might be a short-term slump.“Long range, I’m as confident as ever,” Anderson told HuffPost. “Short-term? Everyone should tighten their belts a bit while we explore whether federal legalization is a this-administration thing, a next-administration thing, or a next-next administration thing. I think it’s equally likely to happen in all three scenarios.”"}, {"title": "Parks Coalition Presses Biden To Establish 6 New Protected Monuments", "text": "An organization representing current and former National Park Service employees is calling for President Joe Biden to use his executive power to establish several new national monuments around the country and advance his goal of conserving 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030.TheCoalition to Protect America’s National Parks published a report Tuesday that identifies six “national treasures in need of protection” and urges Biden to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 to make it happen.Those sites include Castner Range, a 7,000-acre former military weapon testing facility east of El Paso that is home to archeological sites and a diversity of wildlife, and Avi Kwa Ame, meaning “Spirit Mountain” in the Mojave language, an area of southern Nevada that is sacred to 12 Native American tribes.Signed into law in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Antiquities Act authorizes the president to “declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments.” Sixteen presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used it to create more than 150 monuments.But in recent years, the Antiquities Act and monument designations have become political lightning rods.The Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers in Western states have condemned what they argue are abuses of the act meant to “lock up” federal lands and waters. That anti-monument sentiment culminated with then-President Donald Trump dismantling three sites: Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument off the East Coast. In October, however, Biden reversed the Trump-era rollbacks, restoring the sites to their original boundaries and reinstating more stringent protections.On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to not only reverse Trump’s monument rollbacks but also to establish new protected sites to combat global climate change and safeguard ecologically important landscapes. He signed an executive order shortly after taking office that set a goal of protecting 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30.” And last May, the administration published a report outlining its vision for a 10-year “locally led” effort to conserve and restore lands and waters, slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and address inequalities in who has access to nature and the outdoors.But more than a year into his term, Biden has yet to designate a new monument — even as his administration works to advance its 30x30 conservation target.​​Mike Murray, chair of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, told HuffPost that the Antiquities Act is an important conservation tool and that his organization is disappointed national monuments have not been a bigger part of the 30x30 discussion.“It’s time for the administration to make use of the Antiquities Act and to protect some of these special sites,” he said.The coalition is pushing for the designation of six monuments to safeguard a range of natural, cultural and historical resources. Along with Castner Range and Avi Kwa Ame, the group’s wish list includes:There is local support for monument designations at all six sites.To come up with the list, the coalition formed a working group of people with various backgrounds and expertise, and sought feedback from its membership. The result, Murray said, is a list of proposals that are achievable and would protect a variety of sites in different parts of the country“Perhaps it’s the first round of recommendations,” Murray said. “We just hope to get the conversation started and encourage the admin, with the time they have left, to move forward.”The coalition’s 13-page report, titled “In Support of the Antiquities Act: The Lasting Impacts of National Monuments,” does not advocate for specific monument acreages or quantify how much closer new designations would get the Biden administration to its 30x30 target. It does, however, highlight how many of America’s iconic national parks were first protected as national monuments, including the Grand Canyon, Alaska’s Glacier Bay and California’s Death Valley.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland traveled last month to Castner Range, where she hiked adjacent lands and met with local officials “to learn about their vision for increasing access to, and conservation of, outdoor spaces,” the Department of the Interior said in a press release at the time. The range remains off-limits to the public due to unexploded ordnance from years of military testing.But the White House has not signaled that it is planning to protect Castner Range or any other site via presidential proclamation. Neither the White House nor the Interior Department would comment on the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks’ proposal.In addition to Tuesday’s report, more than 300 members of the coalition signed on to a letter Tuesday calling for the administration to create new monuments and “continue to build an inclusive and resilient conservation legacy that reflects the diversity of our natural heritage and permanently protects our lands and waters.”“Many of us have served at national parks across the country that were first protected as national monuments,” says the letter, addressed to Biden, Haaland and Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality. “Thanks to the use of the Antiquities Act, irreplaceable natural and cultural resources have been protected for the enjoyment of future generations.”"}, {"title": "Biden Reverses Trump-Era Rewrite Of Key Environmental Law", "text": "President Joe Biden’s White House on Tuesday finalized its reversal of the Trump administration’s industry-friendly overhaul of one of America’s bedrock environmental laws.The new rules from the White House Council on Environmental Quality restore key provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, requiring federal agencies to once again evaluate climate impacts when reviewing pipelines, power plants, airports and other infrastructure projects.“Restoring these basic community safeguards will provide regulatory certainty, reduce conflict, and help ensure that projects get built right the first time,” CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory said in a statement. “Patching these holes in the environmental review process will help projects get built faster, be more resilient, and provide greater benefits to people who live nearby.”NEPA is a 50-year-old law that protects air, water and land by requiring federal regulators to conduct detailed environmental assessments of major infrastructure projects. The Trump-era changes, finalized in 2020, were the first major update to the law in more than four decades, part of a broad administrative effort to fast-track energy projects and other development. Along with allowing agencies to ignore climate impacts, the rewrite largely cut out the public from the environmental review process.Critics condemned the Trump administration’s overhauls as an attack on environmental justice, as NEPA is a primary avenue for communities, often composed of low-income individuals and people of color, to oppose projects that could endanger the environment and public health.Under the Biden administration’s new rule, agencies must account for all environmental impacts, including how greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution could further harm communities already suffering from disproportionate environmental effects. The rule also “restores the full authority of agencies to work with communities to develop and analyze alternative approaches that could minimize environmental and public health costs.”The White House said the rules unveiled Tuesday are the first of two phases of regulations to strengthen the environmental law.Environmental groups were quick to applaud the move. Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environment at the Center for American Progress, called it “a critical first step in rolling back changes made under the previous administration that undermined public input and scientific integrity.”“Now, it’s time to urgently move to the next phase in restoring protections for the environmental review process,” she said. “That means making sure the process is clear, effective, and inclusive so that President Biden’s planned buildout of clean energy capacity can continue smoothly.”The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the corporate lobby with a long history of opposing climate regulations, warned that the changes would only add to an already burdensome infrastructure approval process.“With rapidly rising inflation, major supply chain disruptions and workforce shortages, the last thing our country needs is unnecessarily extensive and duplicative bureaucratic red tape and delayed project approvals,” Marty Durbin, the chamber’s senior vice president of policy, said in a statement.Tuesday’s announcement comes as many climate and environmental advocates are growing increasingly frustrated with Biden’s record on climate. In a call with reporters on Monday, a senior administration official criticized the media and pundits, saying they have sought to declare Biden’s climate agenda dead."}, {"title": "Bloody-Belly Comb Jelly Caught Pooping For The First Time -- And It Sparkles!", "text": "Here’s a sight that’s probably never been caught on camera before: the bloody-belly comb jelly in the middle of a jelly dump.The Monterey Bay Aquarium posted the footage on its Twitter feed this week, noting that the jelly’s poops actually sparkle.“Move over, unicorns,” the organization wrote in a followup tweet:The bloody-belly comb jelly, which is a ctenophore and not a true jelly, is featured in the aquarium’s new exhibition, Into the Deep.“Ironically, at the depths where the bloody-belly lives, it’s nearly invisible to predators,” the aquarium noted on its website. “In the darkness of the deep sea, animals that are red appear black and blend into the dark background.”Since the bloody-belly comb jelly’s prey can be bioluminescent, that blood-red gut hides what it ate, thus hiding the jelly, too.“A predator with a glowing gut could easily become prey,” the website said.George Matsumoto, the marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) who discovered the bloody-belly comb jelly in 2003, told the Mercury News that he didn’t think it could ever be displayed as it would melt when collected.“I never had an intact specimen. I never saw it under a microscope,” he said. “It was so sensitive to temperature change, I thought it couldn’t be displayed.”As a result, he estimated that only two dozen people had observed the bloody-belly comb jelly while it was alive ― until now.

Since this new species is from Tennessee and she lived in Tennessee for a while, I thought it was a nice fit.”The wriggly arthropod, which will also go by the common name of Swift twisted-claw millipede, is one of 17 new species revealed in a study published last week by Hennen and other researchers at Virginia Tech.The explanation for the name is included in the study, which says the millipede was named in recognition of Swift’s “talent as a songwriter and performer and in appreciation of the enjoyment her music” brought to Hennen.We can’t help but see some similarities between the Nannaria swiftae and the singer’s “Evermore” album cover, where Swift’s plaid coat echoes the color palette of the bug and she rocks a French braid that doesn’t not look like a millipede.She hasn’t spoken up about her eponymous bug yet, but Hennen is hopeful she appreciates what a tribute this is.“I know not everyone likes bugs quite as much as I do, but I hope she thinks it’s a nice gesture,” he said. “For us scientists, we consider it a huge honor to have a species named after you, and I hope she feels the same way.”It’s hard to pick just one favorite Swift song, Hennen said, but currently it’s “either ‘Betty’ from her ‘Folklore’ album or ‘New Romantics’ from ‘1989.’”The singer’s namesake millipede was “collected in mesic forests with hemlock, maple, oak, tuliptree, witch hazel, and pine” ― and if that’s not fodder for lyrics on a “Folklore” or “Evermore” bonus track, we don’t know what is.Hennen and his team have played a huge role in expanding the number of species in the Nannaria wilsoni genus of millipedes, which thrive in Appalachia’s moist valleys.“In the past two years, my colleagues and I have described 54 new species in the genus, which now has 78 species!” he wrote in an email to HuffPost. “These millipedes aren’t as large and flashy as others in the family Xystodesmidae, commonly known as the cherry millipedes, due to their chemical defenses, which smell like cherries or almonds.”The Nannaria swiftae looks similar to other twisted-claw millipedes, Hennen explained, but is differentiated by modified legs on the males.Millipedes may be tiny ― the ones in this genus are only about half an inch to 1½ inches (15 to 38 millimeters) long ― but they play a key role in the forest ecosystem. They’re responsible for breaking down organic matter on the forest floor, such as dead leaves, preventing it from piling up and helping nutrients and carbon cycle through living and non-living parts of the ecosystem. They also play an important role in loosening soil as they burrow small tunnels.Lucky for the Swift-named millipede, it’s residing in a pretty safe habitat.“One of the places we found the millipede is a state park, which is great for conservation purposes because that means the millipede has protected land to live on,” Hennen said. “We worry about the survival of some of these millipede species with small distributions because if their habitat disappears, they don’t have many other places to go.”"}, {"title": "'We’ve Been Trying To Warn You': Fed-Up Scientists Get Arrested Demanding Climate Action", "text": "Scientists in multiple countries protested to demand real government action on climate change, with some engaging in dramatic civil disobedience like chaining themselves to a bank door or gluing their hands to a government building.“I’m willing to take a risk for this gorgeous planet, for my sons,” Peter Kalmus, a biological systems and climate change scientist at NASA, told Insider. “We’ve been trying to warn you guys for so many decades that we’re heading towards a fucking catastrophe, and we’ve been being ignored.”That’s why Kalmus and three others chained themselves to an office building of Chase Bank (JPMorgan Chase has invested more money in fossil fuels than any other bank) last week in Los Angeles.

The statement also noted that a survey of bald eagles near Georgia’s coast found more “failed nests” than expected, some containing dead eaglets. It wasn’t immediately clear if nest failures were due to avian flu.Over the past month, H5N1 has also killed eagles in Maine, Ohio, South Dakota and Vermont, NPR reported. Wildlife rehabilitation center Back to the Wild said earlier in April that a dozen deathly ill eagles had been brought in, typically too sick to fly and unsteady on their feet.“All of them died within hours of admission,” Back to the Wild assistant director Heather Tuttle told local news station WTVG. “One actually died within minutes of admission. When it comes to avian influenza we’ve not had an outbreak like this in our area.”Once deeply endangered in the lower 48 states, bald eagles are widely considered a major conservation success story. Steve Holmer of the American Bird Conservancy noted in 2018, however, that while eagles are no longer classified as endangered, people must “stay vigilant” to continue to protect the birds.H5N1 has been detected in 25 states and has also been found in myriad other wild birds, including owls, geese, ducks and vultures. But its biggest toll has been on domestic chickens and turkeys. More than 20 million birds have been killed on farms where the flu has been detected in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.Meanwhile, zoos across North America have been keeping their birds inside, fearing that the virus could be devastating if any of the avian residents caught it.Health officials have said that the risk to human health at this time is low. There’s been only one known case of H5N1 in humans, a person in England who raised birds and was asymptomatic."}, {"title": "New Mexico Wildfire Spurs Evacuation Order For 5,000 People", "text": "Douglas Siddens’ mother was among those who made it out with just the clothes on her back when a deadly, wind-fueled wildfire ripped through a mountain community in southern New Mexico.The RV park where she lived was reduced to “metal frame rails and steel wheels,” said Siddens, who managed the site“I had like 10 people displaced. They lost their homes and everything, including my mom,” he said.The fire has destroyed more than 200 homes and killed two people since it broke out Tuesday near the village Ruidoso, a vacation spot that draws thousands of tourists and horse racing fans every summer.Hundreds of homes and summer cabins dot the surrounding mountainsides. The RV park that Siddens managed is near where an elderly couple was found dead this week outside their charred residence.Elsewhere in the U.S., crews have been battling large fires this week in Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado, where a new blaze forced evacuations Friday along the Rocky Mountain’s eastern front near Lyons about 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Boulder.That fire was burning in the Blue Mountains near the Larimer-Boulder county line about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Estes Park, the east entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park.In New Mexico, power was restored to all but a few hundred customers, but evacuation orders for close to 5,000 people remained in place.Donations poured in from surrounding communities all too familiar with just how devastating wildfires can be.It was a decade ago that fire ripped through part of the village of Ruidoso, putting the vacation spot on the map with the most destructive wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history when more than 240 homes burned and nearly 70 square miles (181 square kilometers) of forest were blackened by a lightning-sparked blaze.On Friday, Mayor Lynn Crawford was rallying heartbroken residents once again as firefighters tried to keep wind-whipped flames from making another run at the village. She said the response from their neighbors has been amazing.“So we have plenty of food, we have plenty of clothes, those kinds of things but we still appreciate and need your prayers and your thoughts,” the mayor said during a briefing. “Again, our hearts go out to the family of the deceased, to those that have lost their homes.”Authorities have yet to release the names of the couple who died. Their bodies were found after worried family members contacted police, saying the couple had planned to evacuate Tuesday when the fire exploded but were unaccounted for later that day.While many older residents call Ruidoso home year round, the population of about 8,000 people expands to about 25,000 during the summer months as Texans and New Mexicans from hotter climates seek respite.Fans also flock to Ruidoso Downs, home to one of the sport’s richest quarter-horse competitions. The racing season was expected to start May 27, and horses that board there aren’t in any danger as fire officials use the facility as a staging ground.Part-time residents have taken to social media over the last few days, pleading with fire officials for updates on certain neighborhoods, hoping their family cabins weren’t among those damaged or destroyed.The hotlines lit up Friday afternoon as people in the village called in to report more smoke. Fire information officer Mike DeFries said that was because there were flare-ups within the interior of the fire as the flames found pockets of unburned fuel.While the fire didn’t make any runs at the lines crews had established, he said it was still a tough day for firefighters due to single-digit humidity, warmer temperatures and the wind.Authorities reiterated that it was still too early to start letting people in to see the damage. They asked for patience as fire crews put out hot spots and tried to build a stronger perimeter around the blaze.“It’s still an active fire area in there and it’s not a safe place,” DeFries said. “It’s going to require patience. At the same time, every step that we’re taking is designed to suppress this fire and to get people back home as soon as possible.”New Mexico authorities said they suspect the fire, which has torched more than 9.5 square miles (24 square kilometers) of forest and grass, was sparked by a downed power line and the investigation continued Friday.Hotter and drier weather coupled with decades of fire suppression have contributed to an increase in the number of acres burned by wildfires, fire scientists say. The problem is exacerbated by a more than 20-year Western megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change.___Cedar Attanasio contributed reporting from Santa Fe.

(AP) — The Biden administration is sharply raising rates for royalties companies pay on oil and natural gas extracted from federal lands as it moves forward under court order with sales of public fossil fuel reserves in nine states, Interior Department officials said Friday.The announcement comes as Republicans pressure President Joe Biden to expand U.S. crude production and rein in higher gasoline prices contributing to record inflation. Biden also faces calls from within his own party to do more to curb emissions from fossil fuels that are driving climate change.The royalty rate for new leases will increase to 18.75%, from the current 12.5%. That’s a 50% percent jump and marks the first increase to royalties for the government in decades.Leases for 225 square miles (580 square kilometers) of federal lands primarily in the West will be offered for sale in a notice to be posted on Monday, officials said. That’s about 30 % less land than officials had earlier proposed for sale  in November and less than what was originally nominated by the industry.The sales notices will cover leasing decisions in nine states — Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Montana, Alabama, Nevada, North Dakota and Oklahoma.Interior Department officials declined to specify which states would have parcels for sale or to give a breakdown of the amount of land by state, saying that information would be included in Monday’s sales notice.Burning fossil fuels extracted from public lands accounts for about 20% of energy-related U.S. emissions, making them a prime target for climate activists who want to shut down leasing.Republicans want more drilling, saying it would increase U.S. energy independence and help bring down the cost of crude. But oil companies have been hesitant to expand drilling because of uncertainty over how long high prices will continue.The onshore lease sales will be the first by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management since Biden suspended them just a week after taking office in January 2021, as part of his plan to address climate change.The administration was ordered last year to resume the sales by a federal judge in Louisiana, who said Interior officials offered no “rational explanation” for canceling them.Hundreds of parcels of public land that companies nominated for leasing had been previously dropped from the upcoming lease sale because of concerns about wildlife being harmed by drilling rigs."}, {"title": "Missing Wallaby Found Hiding In Bush Near Memphis Zoo Exhibit", "text": "Honey Bunch, the wallaby who went missing at the Memphis Zoo after storms passed through Tennessee this week, has been found hiding — nearly in plain sight.“It was an area right behind the exhibit ... that had been searched multiple times in the past 36 hours, but he was camouflaged really well and hidden very well under a bush,” said Jessica Faulk, the zoo’s spokesperson.A curator happened to see some tracks Friday morning and followed them to Honey Bunch, Faulk said.“We suspect he was there the whole time,” she said.Honey Bunch was taken to the zoo’s hospital and was being evaluated by a veterinarian, who gave him a clean bill of health, Faulk said.A creek in the KangaZoo exhibit overflowed during storms Wednesday night, and the exhibit was evacuated, with the animals moved to the hospital.

They were also emaciated and suffered from inflammation of their brains and feline parvovirus. Parvo is highly contagious and can cause feline panleukopenia and death, particularly in young kittens.Cubs P-100 and P-102 died a short time after they were found.

Once completed, the two projects combined are expected to reduce New York City’s demand for fossil fuels by 51%.“Simply put, if we can’t deliver renewable energy to New York City, we can’t reduce emissions from the fossil fuel fleet,” Rory Christian, the commission’s chairman and lone appointee who hails from New York City, said at the hearing. “Should we delay and reconsider our approach at another time, we’ll very likely run the risk of putting ourselves in the unenviable position of paying more for future projects with lesser benefits.”This final approval gives Gov. Kathy Hochul (D), who is campaigning for a full term in office this year, a major climate victory as she heads into a primary election she’s currently favored to win.“New York continues to lead the nation with innovative green energy initiatives and has been an example to the rest of the world how to confront the perils of climate change, the existential threat of our time,” Hochul said in a statement. “Today’s decision is a major step forward.”Clean Path New York, a 175-mile line from a substation in New York’s Delaware County into the borough of Queens, generated little controversy, but carried greater risks, as the project has yet to receive permits and won’t come online until 2027 at the earliest. By contrast, the Champlain Hudson Power Express, a 339-mile conduit from hydro dams in Canada to the Queens neighborhood of Astoria, stoked heated challenges from a ragtag alliance of environmentalists, gas-fired generators and Indigenous groups.The opposition cited concerns ranging from the costs to New York ratepayers and competition to New York energy companies, to fears that Hydro-Québec, the government-owned utility behind the project, might prioritize Canadians in a disaster or repeat its dark history of seizing Indigenous lands in Canada to build more dams and increase its electricity output.Critics also raised issues with the current contract, which does not obligate Hydro-Québec to sell the same amount of power to the city during winter months, when electricity demand is forecast to peak at some point in the next few decades. Currently, New York City’s power demand surges in the summertime, when air conditioning to fend off the sweltering heat spikes. As the city moves away from gas for heating, electric heat pumps are expected to make demand soar the highest during the cold months.But the company, and economic analysts working for the state commission, downplayed that concern, noting that the utility would have a financial incentive to make more money selling power when demand was high.Still, intrastate regional rivalries took center stage in the debate, with commissioners from upstate arguing that New York City would receive virtually all the benefits as ratepayers in the state’s poorer, northern reaches would possibly see increases to their electric bills.Complaining that “nary a word” was said about the projects in upstate media, Commissioner John Howard — the former chairman, who was demoted after he refused Hochul’s pressure to resign from the panel — said “this lack of proactive outreach is to say, at the very least, troubling.”“Even today, we heard over and over again the vast majority of benefits to this proposal accrue to New York City,” Howard said.Supporters of the project countered that the New York City government had already budgeted tens of millions of dollars to help finance the project, and a landmark municipal law passed in 2019, requiring large buildings to slash energy use, also incentivized landlords to help pay for the hydro line. Another state agency, the Office of General Services, had also signaled it was going to make a deal to help pay for the project.Commissioner Diane Burman said those commitments were not firm enough, and were thus “troubling and unacceptable.”“I struggle with being able to approve these contracts at a time when consumers all across this state are already experiencing rising supply costs and record-high inflation,” she said.But Commissioner Tracey Edwards — who, coming from Long Island, was the only other appointee representing the densely populated downstate region besides Christian — said that voting down the transmission projects only cleared the way to approve more fossil fuel use in the state.“We are rightly concerned about the costs of doing things differently, but I believe that we do have an obligation and moral and health obligation to do things differently,” she said. “I’m not comfortable continuing to spend ratepayer money on the same dirty fossil fuel results if there is an alternative before us.”Opponents of the Champlain Hudson line had urged commissioners to approve the Clean Path project but reject the Canadian deal and reopen the bidding process.But a big part of Champlain Hudson’s appeal was that the project already had state and federal permits, and could begin construction in a matter of weeks. If all starts on schedule, the line would start running hydro power into New York City by December 2025, two years earlier than Clean Path and likely several more years before any new proposal.Champlain Hudson also already had contracts in place, meaning it locked in prices from before inflation soared across the world. This means that, in all probability, any alternative would not only come online much later, but cost much more due to increased material prices.Marco Padula, an economist at the state’s Department of Public Services, testified that approving both transmission lines “would be the way to go to maximize the energy benefits for the state.”“We can all be extremely proud today. New Yorkers have chosen Québec’s clean hydropower to supply 20% of the electricity needs of America’s largest city,” Sophie Brochu, chief executive of Hydro-Québec, said in a statement. “This project, a model for an equitable energy transition, is an eloquent example of how we can work together to decarbonize the Northeastern United States.”A handful of Québec’s 55 Indigenous communities, which total some 107,000 people, fiercely opposed Champlain Hudson, arguing that Hydro-Québec’s past seizures of their land were an extension of the attempted genocide of the Americas’ native inhabitants by European settlers. The Hudson Riverkeeper, a New York environmental advocate, echoed their concerns, repeatedly calling the electricity that would flow on the Champlain Hudson “blood energy” from “stolen” lands. The group also cited concerns over what building new dams would do to local ecosystems and food chains, in particular from mercury poisoning that a Harvard University study suggested could come from flooding previously dry forested land.But the city’s contract with Hydro-Québec barred construction of new dams, though some dams already under construction could qualify to sell power on the line. Research commissioned by the company found zero examples of mercury poisoning stemming from its dams. And the company had made deals with several First Nations communities to both co-own a stretch of the Champlain Hudson’s transmission line in Canada and buy additional power from an Indigenous-owned wind farm.There were also environmental justice arguments in favor of approving the line. For decades, poor, mostly nonwhite neighborhoods on the western edges of Queens, where much of the city’s gas- and oil-burning power plants are located, have been known as “Asthma Alley,” owing to the high rates of breathing problems there. Costa Constantinides, a former New York City Council member from Astoria who represented those neighborhoods, called the state’s approval of the project “a big win for communities who have for too long had to bear the burden of fossil fuel generation.”“This is a big win for New York City,” Constantinides said after the hearing. “It’s a down payment on the renewable energy future we’ve been promised. We have a lot more to do.”Energy experts overwhelmingly agree that building more transmission lines is vital to decarbonizing the U.S. electricity grid, because renewables like wind and solar are dependent on optimal weather, and urban and industrial centers with the great demand rarely have the space to generate their own electricity. Hydropower, like fossil fuels or nuclear reactors, can run 24/7 and come online quickly when demand spikes, meaning its availability makes it easier for New York to add more intermittent renewable sources without risking blackouts.The state’s legally enshrined climate goals mandate that it generate 70% of its electricity from renewables, including hydropower, by 2030, and eliminate emissions from the power sector entirely by 2040.Reaching that goal, Edwards said, required reinterpreting the commission’s 115-year-old mandate to look solely at the impact to ratepayers from approving new projects and abandon a reliance on the “same old, same old” at a moment when “we’re running out of time.” The lone Black woman on the commission, she poignantly compared the need to “evolve” to meet new challenges of climate change to the way the Civil Rights Act required fundamental changes to how government bureaucrats viewed their mandates to serve citizens.“Just think about what the air quality was and the emissions in 1907,” when the Public Service Commission was established, she said.“Sometimes we have to move past that, just like how the Civil Rights Act evolved. We have to evolve with it,” she added. That meant making tough choices to move the state in the direction it needs to go to slash emissions and local air pollution.“Is it perfect? Absolutely not,” Edwards said. “Do I think that we will get better over time as these projects continue? Yes I do.”"}, {"title": "Expanding Drought Leaves Western U.S. Scrambling For Water", "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

Smoke from distant wildfires and dust kicked up by intense spring winds fill the valley, exacerbating the feeling of distress that is beginning to weigh on residents.One of North America’s longest rivers, the Rio Grande is another example of a waterway in the western U.S. that’s tapped out.From the Pacific Northwest to the Colorado River Basin, irrigation districts already are warning farmers to expect less this year despite growing demands fueled by ever-drying conditions. Climate experts say March marked the third straight month of below-average precipitation across the U.S. and areas of record dryness are expanding in the West.On Thursday, federal water managers are scheduled to share their annual operating plan for the Rio Grande, a major water source for millions people and thousands of square miles of farmland in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Mexico. Its outlook is expected to be similarly bleak.Mark Garcia, who farms about 400 acres (160 hectares) with his family in Valencia County, just south of Albuquerque, ran the numbers. He has a degree in mathematics and taught calculus for years before retiring and turning to the farm full time.He found his family would be compensated for not irrigating about half of its acreage this year, and more water would be left in the river to help New Mexico work off a debt that has been growing as the state falls short of its obligations to deliver water to neighboring Texas.“Logically, it was almost like a no-brainer,” Garcia said of opting into the fallowing program. “The risk analysis was, I had to take it, I had to do it. I didn’t want to, though.”Sitting in his backhoe in one of his fields, Garcia began to get emotional. He said he grew up watching his dad farm the land.“I was born into this,” he said. “The hard thing for me is I feel like I don’t want the government to pay for me not to work. I have an issue with that.”The state of New Mexico and the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District are hoping more farmers can make that tough choice — at least long enough to help managers address the pending water debt.Even the conservancy district, which oversees irrigation from Cochiti Dam south to Elephant Butte Reservoir, acknowledges it’s a temporary solution.Casey Ish, a water resources specialist with the district, said over 200 irrigators have enrolled, and officials are targeting fields that are less productive or need to be rested.“For us, this is just one tool and one way the district is trying to help the state manage the state’s compact debt, but we certainly don’t anticipate pulling a third or half the district into a fallowing program year over year,” Ish said. “That’s not sustainable from a price point or an ag point.”Thursday’s virtual meeting will include estimates of how much the Bureau of Reclamation will have to work with this season based on spring runoff predictions and current reservoir levels.With below-average snow cover and reservoirs in some places reaching critically low levels, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted in its most recent monthly climate report that concerns are mounting that the western drought will intensify.On the Colorado River, the U.S. Interior Department recently proposed holding back water in Lake Powell to maintain Glen Canyon Dam’s ability to generate electricity amid what it said were the driest conditions in the region in more than 1,200 years.The potential impacts to lower basin states that could see their water supplies reduced — California, Nevada and Arizona — aren’t yet known. But the conundrum speaks to the wide-ranging functions of Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam, and the need to quickly pivot to confront climate change.In the Pacific Northwest, experts are predicting one of the driest summers on record, noting that nearly 71% of the region made up of Oregon, Washington and Idaho is in drought and nearly one-quarter is already experiencing extreme drought.An irrigation district that supplies more than 1,000 farmers and ranchers on the California-Oregon border announced earlier this week that they would get a fraction of their normal water allocation this year due to drought. It’s the third consecutive year that severe drought has impacted farmers, fish and tribes in a region where there’s not enough water to satisfy competing demands.Irrigation districts that supply water to farmers along the Rio Grande in southern New Mexico and along the Pecos in the east also are promising short seasons.Just north of the New Mexico-Colorado border, farmers in the San Luis Valley turned on their spigots April 1, drawing on their share of the Rio Grande. Water managers in New Mexico immediately saw the gauges drop, meaning less water ultimately will make its way to central New Mexico."}, {"title": "Ecology Professor Theorizes Loch Ness Monster May Just Be Whale Penis", "text": "An ecology professor has just come up with a theory about the Loch Ness Monster that is sure to stimulate controversy.Michael Sweet, who is a professor in molecular ecology at the University of Derby, recently suggested on Twitter that “Nessie” isn’t a monster at all, but just a whale penis.Sweet said that many sea monster stories reported by explorers were inspired by what he called “tentacled and alienesque appendages emerging from the water.”But while many of the observers may have believed the appendages breaking the ocean surface might be part of something “more sinister lurking beneath,” Sweet said that in many cases, “it was just whale dicks.”Sadly, Nessie was unavailable to comment on the whale penis hypothesis, but, to be fair, its just the latest theory to pop up about the probably mythical Scottish creature.Back in 2019, researchers suspected the creature was really a giant eel, while one local man claimed it was just a giant catfish."}, {"title": "White House Says Story That Bird Pooped On Joe Biden Is Just Crap", "text": "Joe Biden went to Iowa on Tuesday to announce the suspension of a federal rule preventing the sale of higher ethanol blend gasoline , but all anyone is talking about is the supposed bird poop attack.The president was speaking at a manufacturing plant in Menlo when a small white drop fell down on his blue suit jacket just above the pocket.Some people ― especially Republicans ― immediately thought the president was being pooped on.And much like the fly that appeared on Mike Pence’s head during the 2020 vice presidential debate, the possible poop inspired lots of Twitter snark from the GOP and other Biden bashers.However, the Des Moines Register said that while there were birds in the giant silo where Biden was speaking, the white substance that fell on Biden’s jacket was actually distillers grain, which it said was a co-product of the ethanol production process.Bloomberg reporter Justin Sink ― who was at the event ― also said the stuff that dropped on Biden was a bit of corn as well.The White House naturally said it was the less crappy substance.On Wednesday, “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy had questions about what he called “birdpoopgate” for his son, White House correspondent Peter Doocy.“When the president started off talking about blaming the Putin price hike, a bird pooped on him.

(AP) — A wind-driven wildfire swept through neighborhoods in a mountain community in drought-stricken south-central New Mexico, burning at least 150 structures and forcing the evacuations of schools with 1,700 students, officials said Wednesday.Homes were among the structures that burned on Tuesday but officials did not have a count of how many were destroyed in the blaze that torched at least 6.4 square miles (16.6 square kilometers) of forest, brush and grass on the east side of the community of Ruidoso, said Laura Rabon, spokesperson for the Lincoln National Forest.No deaths or injuries were reported from the fire fanned by winds gusting between 50 mph (80 kph) and 90 mph (155 kph), Rabon said. The cause of the fire was under investigation.Ruidoso’s high school and middle school were evacuated but didn’t burn. Officials in the village declared a state of emergency for the community and said school classes were cancelled Wednesday as the village coped with power outages due to down power lines.The residences that burned were mostly a mix of trailers and single-family homes, and close to 4,000 people were displaced by evacuations. Village spokeswoman Kerry Gladden said authorities were out trying to survey as much damage as possible before Wednesday afternoon, when winds were expected to gust again, raising the fire threat.“Right now, everybody is just rallying around those who had to be evacuated,” Gladden said. “We’re just trying to reach out to make sure everyone has places to stay. Plus in the middle of all this, our village is still without power. Everybody is just trying to get the resources here on the ground where they’re needed and get everyone fed.”Ruidoso in 2012 suffered one of the most destructive wildfires in New Mexico history, when a lightning-sparked blaze destroyed more than 240 homes and burned nearly 70 square miles (181 square kilometers).Rabon said the latest fire continued burning overnight but was less intense.However, no precipitation was in the forecast and humidity levels remained low, Rabon said.“Those extremely dry conditions are not in our favor,” she said.Another wildfire in the Lincoln National Forest northwest of Ruidoso burned at least 400 acres (1.6 square kilometers) after it was sparked Tuesday by power lines downed by high winds, Rabon said.Elsewhere in New Mexico, wildfires were burning along the Rio Grande south of Albuquerque, in mountains northwest of the community of Las Vegas and in grasslands along the Pecos River near the town of Roswell."}, {"title": "NYC’s Big Clean-Energy Project Poses A Major Climate Test For The Country", "text": "Last April, New York City marked its 51st Earth Day by suing fossil fuel companies over climate change. A week later, the city started burning even more fossil fuel when its largest source of zero-carbon power, the Indian Point nuclear plant, shut down.The move put New York in league with California, Germany and other places that purport to view global warming and the air pollution from burning oil and gas as urgent crises, but have simultaneously shuttered nuclear facilities, which generate massive amounts of power without carbon emissions.With Indian Point closed, roughly 90% of the city’s grid is powered by fossil fuels. Now, New York faces yet another test of its legally mandated commitment to slash its planet-heating emissions by the end of the decade.On Thursday, state regulators will decide the fate of a long-fought proposal to run a transmission line down the Hudson River from hydropower dams in Québec to the New York City neighborhood of Astoria.The project, called the Champlain Hudson Power Express, would replace half of the capacity lost when Indian Point’s reactors stopped running and provide the kind of fast, reliable electricity that weather-dependent renewables like wind and solar struggle to produce on their own. Unlike other proposals that competed for state approval, the transmission line, known by its acronym CHPE and pronounced “chippy,” has all its state and federal permits and support from the mayor, governor and president. Public comments overwhelmingly favored building the project. And it’s ready to begin construction with union labor in a matter of weeks, with the potential to deliver power as early as 2025.Yet as the state Public Service Commission weighs whether the lucrative contract to build and operate the project is in New Yorkers’ interest, a small but vocal alliance of gas companies, environmental groups and Indigenous tribes has formed to persuade regulators to kill the transmission line. Their reasons for opposing the project range from concerns over the costs to New York ratepayers and competition to New York energy companies, to fears that Hydro-Québec, the government-owned utility behind the project, might prioritize Canadians in a disaster or repeat its ugly history of seizing Indigenous lands in Canada to build more dams and increase its electricity output.“This is an unethical project,” said John Lipscomb, vice president of Hudson Riverkeeper, an influential conservation group that previously supported the proposal. Referring to the hydropower as “blood energy” that would be “stolen” from First Nations tribes, he said, “We talk in New York about how we want to support traditionally marginalized communities, but we find a way to overlook these fatal flaws so we can check a green box.”Instead, groups like Riverkeeper and Sierra Club, along with local gas-burning power generators, want the state to block the Champlain Hudson and kick off a new contest for alternative projects.But such a move would likely delay the delivery of new, clean electricity sources until the end of the decade, and increase costs since the existing Champlain Hudson contracts locked in prices before the current inflation crisis began. On Tuesday night, New York Communities for Change, a progressive climate group, recanted its yearslong opposition to Champlain Hudson and called on the state to approve the line, noting that no other project has any hope of coming online as quickly.“While we respect opponents making good faith arguments against this project, we believe there is simply no time left to waste to bring renewable energy to New York City,” the group said in a statement. “No transmission project is perfect. All have real and painful downsides. Nonetheless, we have decided to support CHPE because it will rapidly reduce New York City’s massive climate impact.”For many who live in western Queens’ power plant corridor, nicknamed “Asthma Alley” over the lasting health effects of smokestack pollution, more time means more breathing problems.“All those environmentalist groups that say we can wait? Let’s find out where they live at,” said Bishop Mitchell Taylor, a preacher and supporter of the project who grew up near the Queensbridge Houses, neighboring one of the city’s biggest and most visible fossil-fueled power plants. “They can wait because they don’t live in Asthma Alley.”The Champlain Hudson would run 339 miles south from Lake Champlain on the Canadian border and follow the water down along the Vermont state line before veering on land to avoid some sensitive aquatic ecosystems. Once it approaches the northern reaches of the Hudson River again, it would dive again back underwater until it reaches the city, at which point it would cut across Randall’s Island and arrive at a converter station in the vast electrical utility park in the northwesternmost corner of Astoria, Queens.Roughly 40% of the line will be on land and nearly all of it will be buried, either underground or beneath river beds. The project will consist of two five-inch, bidirectional high voltage cables that will be able to transmit hydro and wind power down from Canada, and — if a contract is eventually negotiated to do so — send excess wind power from New York’s planned offshore wind farms back up north.First proposed in 2008, the project — a joint venture between Hydro-Québec and Transmission Developers Inc., a company owned by private equity giant Blackstone Group — faced an uphill battle from the start.Building new transmission lines is vital to shifting the U.S. electrical grid away from fossil fuels. Because renewables, which most analysts predict will be the cheapest way to generate electricity in the decades to come, depend on optimal meteorological conditions, a vast network of lines to carry power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed is key to ensuring that taking gas-fired plants offline will not cause blackouts. Eliminating emissions from vehicles and buildings means swapping internal combustion engines for batteries and gas stoves for induction heat. That could increase U.S. demand for electricity nearly 40% by 2050, according to a recent study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.“Nobody likes their utility. Nobody likes transmission lines. The benefits of transmission lines are both quite real and very vague — broadly lower energy prices, broadly cleaner energy,” said Liza Reed, a climate policy expert at the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank in Washington, D.C. “All of these are true but hard to see.”Opponents of transmission projects have long held the upper hand in U.S. politics, thanks in part to arcane property rights rules that give landowners ample time and opportunities to challenge construction. Mired in regulatory red tape and political opposition, investors pulled the plug in 2009 on a project to build a 190-mile transmission line from upstate New York to the densely populated Hudson Valley. In 2015, a proposal to build a line from northwestern New York down to the city and its northern suburbs died when the village of Buchanen bought the land on which the developers would have built a substation and sold it instead to a gas company constructing a pipeline.The problem is hardly unique to the Empire State. Journalist Russell Gold’s 2019 book “Superpower: One Man’s Quest to Transform American Energy” chronicled how local opponents and fossil fuel allies in Congress tanked a well-financed effort to construct a transmission line connecting wind turbines in gusty Oklahoma to cities in the southeast. More recently, Maine voters last November approved a referendum blocking construction of a separate Hydro-Québec line that would have carried hydroelectricity from Canada to New England’s gas-dependent grid.The Biden administration, which backs Champlain Hudson and listed it among top priority projects, has taken some steps to make building transmission lines easier. The newly passed bipartisan infrastructure law directs billions to transmission issues and gives the federal government more power to designate a national interest in certain projects and routes to build them, making it easier for developers to overcome opponents.“Fighting climate change means we want to electrify as much as possible, and if we don’t want to also build things like nuclear, we’re going to have to get it from zero-carbon resources that might be where the people are,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert and research associate at the University of Texas at Austin. “Every single credible study that looks at how we get to a zero-carbon economy sees a massive buildout of transmission lines.”Last November, just weeks after Maine’s vote, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) announced finalized contracts with both Hydro-Québec and the developers of a second line, called Clean Path New York, meant to carry wind and solar power produced in New York 175 miles down from a substation in New York’s Delaware County to an electrical facility in western Queens.Clean Path New York, which has yet to receive its permits, would come online at the earliest in 2027, two years after Champlain Hudson. But once completed, the two projects combined would slash the downstate grid’s emissions 51% by the end of this decade.Connecting the northeastern U.S. to Québec’s grid follows a fairly straightforward logic. Look on any given day at the website Electricity Map, which provides real-time views of the carbon-intensity of various grids across the world, and you’ll see a completely green Québec neighboring a New York or New England in shades of yellow that, on some days, verge on orange. Luckily for fossil-fuel addicted Americans, Canadians already export a certain amount of clean electricity over the border. On Tuesday afternoon, the site’s data showed 1.53 gigawatts flowing from Québec into New England and 913 megawatts zapping into New York.To accommodate more renewables, states such as New York, Massachusetts and Maine will need electricity that, like gas or coal, can run 24/7 regardless of weather and come online — or, in energy parlance, be “dispatched” — quickly if demand abruptly spikes.Batteries may, at some point, prove cheap and efficient enough to provide those qualities at scale, but relying entirely on that technology raises questions about how much lithium, nickel and other metals can be mined to meet demand, especially when electric vehicles and cellphones are competing for those same minerals.Technology like carbon capture and sequestration, which catches the CO2 and other pollution generated from burning fossil fuels before it enters the atmosphere, could allow the world to reach its climate goals without sacrificing existing power plants. But it’s so far extremely expensive, and requires, by one estimate, building nearly as many miles of new pipelines to carry captured CO2 as exist in the entire state of Florida.Nuclear plants are by far the most efficient and reliable, and — despite popular misconceptions — among the safest forms of energy production yet harnessed by humans. But they’re also costly and deeply unpopular, particularly after the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan. All that makes hydropower more appealing, at least in places like the Northeast that are forecast to become wetter as the planet warms.“Fossil fuel companies, they don’t fear wind. They don’t fear solar, because they still have a business case,” Sophie Brochu, the chief executive of Hydro-Québec, said in an hourlong sit-down interview with HuffPost at a community center in Astoria last November. “But with this system, which is reliable, clean, and competitive all the time, their business model is eroding.”But hydropower has long been loathed by environmentalists. Building massive dams disrupts ecosystems and requires flooding large areas, which push out species and human communities alike. When forests are flooded, microbes in the soil can convert naturally occurring mercury into methylmercury, which then works its way through the local food chain. The effect, according to a 2016 Harvard University study, is to poison people that eat locally caught food like fish or seal meat. About 90% of proposed new hydroelectric dams in Canada threaten to increase Indigenous First Nations communities’ exposure to methylmercury, the paper concluded, though it is possible to mitigate the damage.“Our research suggests that low impact hydroelectric projects are possible with careful site selection,” Elsie Sunderland, the study’s lead author, said in a press release. “Mitigation measures such as removing topsoil that provides the substrate for methylation in these ecosystems may need to be considered in areas where forecasted exposures are high.”Hydro-Québec’s dams were built largely in the 1940s and 1950s on land seized from the Innu, Atikamekw and Anishinabek First Nations. The simmering conflict came to a head in the 1970s, when the Cree and Inuit peoples protested the construction of new dams and forced the Québec government to the bargaining table. The feud yielded the historic James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement, considered by some to be the first “modern treaty” between aboriginal peoples and the Canadian government.Yet life on the Indigenous lands that surround Hydro-Québec’s dams remains difficult. Median income can be less than half the provincial average, and many still lack sewage systems, running water, and access to the electrical grid, forcing them to rely on noisy and polluting generators despite the neighboring hydro dams, the investigative site New York Focus reported last year.As the company pushed to build its transmission projects in New York and New England, the chiefs of several of those tribes, in a letter co-signed by a handful of Native American tribes, urged the U.S. and Canadian governments to “intervene on our behalf” and force Hydro-Québec and Québec leaders to “sit down with us and negotiate.”“Hydro-Québec claims to offer green energy to American consumers, while making billions of dollars in profits at the expense of the Indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands it exploits,” the letter read. “We are tired of this.”In July, the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke, a First Nations band with a population of nearly 11,000 registered members, made a deal with Hydro-Québec, becoming joint owners of a stretch of the Champlain Hudson transmission line in Canada. In a separate HuffPost interview last November, Kahsennenhawe Sky-Deer, the newly elected grand chief of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke, called the deal “unprecedented.” Noting that only a small minority of First Nations in the province challenged the project, she urged Indigenous opponents to set aside historic grievances and embrace industrial projects that promise to cut emissions.“Looking at where our mother is right now, in the grand scheme of global warming, if we don’t start changing the way we’re doing things, we’re all in trouble,” she said. “So it’s not to be looked at now as a racial thing. All the stuff that’s happened in the past, the experience of marginalized people, indigenous people, Black people, Latino people, we have to put all of that behind us and collectively, collaboratively see what we can do differently.”Days later, Hydro-Québec announced a new commitment to work more closely with Québec’s 11 First Nations, which total more than 107,000 people, including donating more money to education programs and hiring more from within the communities.The contract the company negotiated with New York City also stipulates that Hydro-Québec cannot sell electricity from new dams built after the deal was signed. That would still qualify some projects under construction to produce hydroelectricity for New Yorkers, but it also created demand for Hydro-Québec to buy more wind energy to boost the power supply on the line. One of the wind farms is the Apuait, a 240-megawatt project co-owned by Québec Innu communities. Future renewable power lines will also require consulting tribes.That did little to assuage concerns at Riverkeeper, which said those deals don’t offset the damage caused by new dams. It also raised concerns over how species in the Hudson would respond to the electricity, and what kinds of pollutants could be dredged up in the construction process. The group initially supported the Champlain Hudson, which it touted as a way to justify shutting down Indian Point. But after new board members took over the group — and after the nuclear plant closed — Riverkeeper changed its position.“It’s one thing to have a cable running through your land that’s buried. It’s another thing to have dams and reservoirs on your land against your will that flood thousands of square miles of your traditional habitat,” Lipscomb said. “If we were to say to New Yorkers, we’re going to build equivalent sized dams in the Catskills or Adirondacks, there’d be one kind of response versus another response for one buried cable. It’s not comparable.”In Albany’s halls of power, a different story about why to oppose the Champlain Hudson is being told by industry players. For years, the Independent Power Producers of New York, a trade group for the state’s energy utilities, has argued that the transmission line will sap money from the city’s budget and drive up electricity prices upstate.In a white paper, IPPNY said that Hydro-Québec would divert electricity away from lower-cost markets in upstate New York, where it has exported power for over a century, to high-paying customers in New York City, reducing the supply for the northern parts of the state and driving up costs. The state estimated that some upstate ratepayers could see as much as a 10% hike on bills.“Nobody knows what that ratepayer impact is going to be on your bill,” IPPNY CEO Gavin Donohue said. “I don’t know, and I do this for a living.”But Hydro-Québec’s said that double-digit rate increase was cherrypicked from a worse-case scenario state regulators modeled, and argued that analysis fails to consider how much higher rates would be with a delayed, inflation-afflicted alternative. Moreover, the project will be financed in large part through the state Renewable Energy Credit market, with the help of a clause slipped into New York City’s landmark 2019 law requiring big buildings to slash energy use or face fines. The legislation allowed landlords to purchase credits from the hydropower line. The combination of demand for credits and the relatively cheap cost of hydropower could, backers of the project hope, actually bring rates down.And New York City is ready to welcome the project. Mayor Eric Adams, who supports the Hydro-Québec plan, has already budgeted $75 million in 2026 for the project, a spokeswoman said, but noted that the current price estimate may be adjusted over time. Between Champlain Hudson and Clean Path New York, the city expects to pay between $2 billion and $4 billion over the next 25 years — a large number, but still a tiny fraction of what the five boroughs spend on schools and police.“The Champlain Hudson Power Express line and Clean Path New York are vital projects for our city and state. Not only will they help us meet our sustainability goals — they will also be a boon to our recovery, helping to create thousands of good-paying jobs for New Yorkers,” the mayor said in a statement. “Unlocking the potential of the green economy is one of my administration’s key priorities, and we look forward to advancing this project in partnership with local and state officials.”Still, upstate companies are frustrated that a converter station in New York that Hydro-Québec included in one of its alternative bids, which would have allowed renewable energy developers in the region to benefit from the transmission line, did not make it into the winning proposal. That wasn’t Hydro-Québec’s choice — state regulators turned down that proposal. But the talking point could still hold sway over the seven-member Public Service Commission, five of whom hail from the northern parts of New York. Only one represents New York City, and another is from Long Island.“We have a lot of companies that I work for that want to do business in New York State, they want New York jobs, they want to pay New York taxes,” Donohue said. “Why aren’t we taking care of in-state resources, in-state jobs, and in-state power? Instead we’re going to Canada.”A better project, he said, would be one that allowed for technologies that existing fossil fuel companies are more amenable to, including carbon capture and hydrogen fuel.But Costa Constantinides, the former New York City Council member from Astoria who spearheaded the 2019 energy-efficiency law, said if the commissioners reject the project over costs, they ought to come explain that to his neighbors, many of whom are “families spending thousands of dollars on asthma medication.”“If you vote no, you better damn well come down to Queens and give us an explanation,” he said. “Don’t you dare hide in Albany behind your bureaucracy. You’re reaffirming the commitment to fossil fuels in New York City if you vote against this project.”The other argument against Champlain Hudson is that the proposed contract only mandates Hydro-Québec to sell the city power during the summer months, when the sweltering heat makes air conditioning necessary and drives up electricity demand. But the city banned gas hookups in new buildings, and Constantinides’ law incentivizes landlords to cut fossil fuel use. As a result, New York City’s electricity demand is set to surge as heat pumps and electric heaters switch on in the winter months from the 2030s onward, according to forecasts from the New York Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s grids.Opponents of Champlain Hudson say even if there is available electricity in those frigid months, it will likely go to Canadian customers, likely enduring even colder temperatures. But Hydro-Québec said it’s too early to tell what that market will look like, or when exactly the city’s demand will start peaking in the winter. But it suggested it would likely continue to sell capacity ― in which the company is paid to keep its generators ready through the winter in case of a surge in demand ― even if it wasn’t contractually obligated to do so, because it will make more money.“This is a portfolio approach but somehow it’s being pitched as are you for hydro or are you for wind. The reality is, we need both,” said Dan Zarrilli, the former New York City mayor’s climate adviser who served in both the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations. “The fact that this project is permitted and ready to go should make this a simple choice for all of us.”He added: “If we can’t say yes to a project like this, I worry about our ability to hit all of our goals, because we’ve got to be able to make choices like this that put us on the path to clean energy and away from fossil fuels.”Leaning back on a bench as a brisk autumn gust blew through the community center in Astoria last November, Brochu cautioned against seeing her company’s project as a panacea to New York’s energy problems.“It’s not perfect, it’s not the only solution, it’s not a miracle, but it’s a real contribution to the hopes, dreams and aspirations of one of the largest metropoles in the world,” she said. “This is a beautiful flower. But it has to be in a beautiful bouquet.”"}, {"title": "From Plastic Use To Carbon Offsetting, The Truth About Four Common Climate Myths", "text": ""}, {"title": "Hungry Javelina Gets Stuck In Car, Goes For Ride In Arizona", "text": "CORNVILLE, Ariz.

It is backed by an initial $440 million in federal funds over five years — the bulk of which comes from the bipartisan infrastructure law that Congress passed last year — and aims to draw private and philanthropic contributions to reach the $1 billion mark.Early in his tenure, President Joe Biden set a national goal of protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030 in order to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. And last May, the administration published a report outlining its vision for a 10-year “locally led” effort to conserve and restore lands and waters, slash planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and address inequalities in who has access to nature and the outdoors.The new program “will help mobilize new investments in locally led, voluntary conservation and restoration projects across the country, while making it easier for communities to access these resources,” Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said in a statement.Funds will be awarded to projects focused in several areas: conservation and restoration of rivers, coasts, wetlands, forests and grasslands; connecting landscapes and wildlife corridors; increasing resilience to coastal flooding, drought and other climate impacts; and expanding access to the outdoors.The federal investment in the program includes $375 million in ecosystem restoration funds that the Interior Department received via the infrastructure law; $35 million in Forest Service grants for water quality improvement and invasive species prevention; and $25 million in Department of Defense funding to preserve natural resources around military installations.The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a private nonprofit that works closely with federal agencies, will oversee the program, and grants will be prioritized for tribal- and Indigenous-led projects. Proposal applications will be accepted from early May to late July, with funding awarded in November.“The America the Beautiful Challenge offers an opportunity to support local efforts led by those who know, love, and have a stake in their surrounding landscapes,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.Monday’s announcement comes as a little-known Texas group ramps up its disinformation campaign against the Biden administration’s initiative, known informally as “30x30.” Since last year, American Stewards of Liberty, a right-wing group with ties to the fossil fuel industry, has been drumming up opposition to the conservation target by falsely characterizing it as a federal “land grab” and stoking fear in rural communities that the administration is readying to seize control of private property.Later this month, the group will host a “Stop 30x30 Summit” summit in Nebraska. The event is being sponsored by several climate denial and anti-federal lands groups, and its keynote speakers include Trump-era Interior secretary David Bernhardt and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.). Boebert is among Congress’s most outspoken critics of the initiative.There is nothing to support the conservative narrative about 30x30 being a land grab. In fact, the Biden administration’s report on the program included a commitment to “collaboration, support for voluntary and locally led conservation and honoring of Tribal sovereignty and private property rights.”And while 30x30 had drawn fierce opponents, it remains extremely popular nationwide. A January 2021 survey of registered voters found that 80% support the conservation target.“Protecting 30% of America’s lands and waters by the end of the decade can only be accomplished through partnerships and knowledge on the ground in all 50 states,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of conservation group Center for Western Priorities, said in response to Monday’s announcement. “This billion-dollar commitment shows the administration is on the right track to reaching 30x30.”"}, {"title": "Biden Wants U.S. To Lead Climate Efforts", "text": ""}, {"title": "Shelter Dog Gets Personal Princess-Themed Tent To Help Him Relax", "text": "A Michigan dog having a tough time at a shelter now has his own private castle ― a pink princess-themed tent.Starsky, a pit bull around age 2, came to I Heart Dogs Rescue and Animal Haven late last year. But he’s been stressed and fearful in the shelter, volunteer Megan Synk told HuffPost.“In his kennel, Starsky is on edge, defensive, and unsure,” she said in an email. “His pupils are dilated, ears pinned forward, furrowed eyebrows, barking, pacing, and toy shredding.”Synk has spent a lot of time with Starsky and knows there’s another side to him. When he’s out of his kennel and with someone who has earned his trust, he’s a “bouncy, affectionate, curious boy” who loves getting scratches on his head and body.Synk had recently learned that hiding spaces can help alleviate stress for shelter animals, since they can block out the goings-on around them and help them feel “protected,” she said. Since dog houses can be pretty expensive, Synk had the idea to try out a kids pop-up tent.Originally, she was going to grab a dinosaur-themed tent for Starsky, but ultimately went with a unicorn one because it was a little cheaper and she “wanted to soften up his bad boy image.”But after Starsky started chewing up the poles on the unicorn tent, Synk had to get a replacement. “I couldn’t find another unicorn pop-up tent, so I went with the next best theme — princess,” she said.Though the tent hasn’t magically transformed Starsky, it’s been a big help to him.“The tent has given him a place to hide in times of stress or anxiety,” Synk said. “Instead of pacing and barking, he has grabbed a nearby toy to take in his tent with him and lay down instead.”After the way the tent helped Starsky ― and the positive response the organization has gotten from the undeniably cute photos ― I Heart Dogs announced this week that it will be collecting new and used kid tents for other animals in the shelter, too.Starsky is generally still “nervous with new people and situations.” To deal with that, he’s been working with a certified trainer and is “doing GREAT,” Synk said.While he completes his training, he isn’t currently listed publicly for adoption, though Synk noted the rescue might consider placing him in a home “if the right people came along to help him.” (Synk and her husband already have multiple dogs of their own, so they aren’t able to adopt Starsky.)The princess tent has brought Starsky a lot of attention, including on social media and via the “Today” show, and Synk is thrilled he has so much support.“We’ve become such good friends and it’s a wonderful feeling seeing others love him as much as I do,” she said. “It means everything to have so many people rooting for him.”"}, {"title": "How Texas' Energy Woes Are Derailing Life In This Houston Neighborhood", "text": "HOUSTON ― The Southwest Crossing subdivision has always been a quiet place, a haven just outside the city’s concrete jungle where the sound of children laughing bounces off neatly paved streets. That was the case until last May, when some residents started receiving letters from CenterPoint Energy that a propane storage facility was moving in next door.Within weeks, residents Eugene Pack and Brittney Stredic could hear construction equipment revving in the distance. At the time, they wondered how the decision was made to build the facility in their section of Fort Bend County ― where, of the more than 800,000 people who live in this area of the city, nearly half identify as nonwhite, according to recent U.S. Census data. The two have since become outspoken community organizers trying to stop the project.CenterPoint Energy started work on its new propane storage facility in August. It is expected to hold 300,000 gallons of the highly flammable gas in four underground tanks the size of small submarines. The company said the project was planned to be completed in March. Stredic told HuffPost in late March that construction of the propane storage facility was still underway.The facility is just 500 feet from homes, and residents worry about its effects on their health, their safety, their property values — their very future in Southwest Crossing.“The level of fear that they’ve placed in this community, it’s insane,” said Pack, 71, a longtime resident and a preacher at Houston’s Praise and Worship Center in the city’s 3rd Ward neighborhood. He and Stredic were standing in a church parking lot next to the CenterPoint construction site, where workers were leaving with their lunches on a rainy day in November. “I don’t know what they were thinking — to put this much of a chemical in a residential neighborhood. This is a dense area.”Energy has been on the minds of Texans since last year’s rare, fatal winter storm Uri caused power outages for nearly 5 million people across the state. Lawmakers and the energy sector have looked at options for reinforcing the state’s energy grid, but despite passage of legislation and new state standards, energy experts say they haven’t taken many steps.Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry — which produces natural gas, the energy source perhaps most to blame for the 2021 blackouts after freezing temperatures caused operations to fail during peak usage — has been left alone. Propane, a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas used to heat homes and power appliances, accounted for more than 47% of the state’s electricity generation in 2019. Comparable power sources like coal, nuclear, wind and solar make up a combined 52%, according to state data.Natural gas and propane storage expansion have been underway in Texas for years, promoted as a way to shore up the energy grid.But Southwest Crossing residents worry about the possibility of gas leaks and explosions. They also worry about longer-term effects. Across town, Houston’s 5th Ward, another historically diverse neighborhood, has been dealing with a slowly leaking underground plume containing various chemicals ― including creosote, which preserves wood — from a former rail yard site. The plume is alleged to have created cancer clusters among longtime residents, including in children.“All it takes is one time, one human error,” said Stredic, 27, a lifelong Southwest Crossing resident who has taken time away from her college education to organize against the CenterPoint Energy propane storage site. “People are going to make mistakes. It’s just a matter of, when is that mistake going to happen?”Texas is the top energy-producing state in the U.S., with an energy sector worth an estimated $712 billion. The Lone Star State also consumes more energy than any other state, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But mistakes have become commonplace as the state attempts to reinforce its power grid.In 1989 and 2011, Texans experienced widespread power failures due to extreme winter weather. Both episodes offered warnings for future winter storms, but neither regulators nor utilities took action, setting up the calamity the state saw in 2021.At the height of Uri, natural gas wells and wind turbines froze, and coal, nuclear and gas plants were knocked offline — effectively disabling the bulk of Texas’ power grid. As a result, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the grid, cut power for several days to 2 million homes. Natural gas use spiked as Texans weathered freezing temperatures within their homes, and power plants were unable to restart to meet needs due to extreme weather. It was the largest forced outage in U.S. history.The decision was a last-ditch effort to keep Texas’ energy grid online, and it left Texans scrambling to stay warm. Some burned books and furniture in their homes — with some accidentally burning their homes down in the process. State estimates in the aftermath found that 246 people died in 77 counties. However, other estimates indicate that the final number of casualties from the winter storm was likely much higher.Natural gas utilities, Texas’ majority source of power during winter months, blamed electricity generators for the blackouts. But energy experts say the real problem was that utility companies hadn’t weatherized the grid, which would have required enclosing equipment at power facilities to better protect them from extreme weather. Pressurized dry air is needed to run turbines that then generate electricity for the grid. Importantly, the weatherization precautions keep the dry air dry, as well as operable.Since then, the standards expected of Texas’ power plants have changed. The state’s Public Utility Commission passed new rules, effective as of December, mandating that power plants better winterize their systems, and requiring that operators provide a “notarized attestation” that fixes have been made since the 2021 winter storm. There are also comprehensive, year-round guidelines for weather emergency preparedness and standards.Meanwhile, state lawmakers passed a bill in the most recent legislative session that set new weatherization standards for Texas’ independent energy grid. But while the legislation did create a winter storm emergency alert plan and established the Texas Energy Reliability Council, not included in the bill was funding for necessary weatherization upgrades. The upshot, energy experts say, is that substantive action since the winter storm has been underwhelming. In fact, natural gas facilities, whose failure contributed significantly to the winter storm blackout, have been left alone.Despite pleas from across the political spectrum, upon signing the bill in June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared that “everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid.”Texas has been the only state on its own power grid since 1935, a hawkish means of avoiding federal regulation. However, the state’s independent grid offers a unique opportunity for companies like CenterPoint Energy to capitalize on catastrophic winter storms.As part of an enormous $40 billion spending plan that the Houston-based company announced last September, CenterPoint intends to invest $16 billion in natural gas expansion nationwide over the next 10 years. It has also pledged to lower its emissions to net zero by 2035, an initiative that entails retiring coal units and implementing more solar power technology, according to the company.Included in the plan is increased use of technologies like propane-air peak shaving facilities. The technology, which has been used since at least the 1950s, blends vaporized liquid propane and compressed air to store for use when natural gas supplies are short. The Southwest Crossing project is one such facility.Propane-air peak shaving facilities “are there to be a little bit of a backup,” said Dr. Carey King, an assistant director and research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute.The technology also has the benefit of providing additional backup for the grid when the next storm hits, he noted.“Some places might be better connected or have more than one connection,” King said. “If one power line goes down, there’s another one that’s delivering power to a given area.”CenterPoint Energy built its first propane-air peak shaving facility, the Bluebonnet Point Reserve, in North Houston, another predominantly Black and Hispanic section of the city, in October 2019. The Southwest Crossing facility will be the fourth in the Houston area.“It’s a short distance away. To have two of these types of facilities is a pretty scary thought,” Stredic said. “It’s enough to take out our whole community on this side and that side.”Stredic and Pack have been at the forefront of their community’s effort. They’ve led protests next to the construction site, and they’ve helped keep neighbors informed. They, like other members of their community, want answers from either the city or CenterPoint Energy on why neighborhoods with high shares of people of color were chosen for the facilities.“As you can see, we’re sitting right next to a gas station, and there’s a church, and there’s another gas station,” Stredic said, pointing down the street. “I don’t know if they considered that the lives here needed to be protected.”Historically, industrial sites built near diverse neighborhoods aren’t coincidental, especially in Houston.A 2017 paper by sociologists at Rice University found that the city’s Black children, who are more likely to live in industry-heavy sections of the city, are twice as likely to develop asthma as Houston’s white children. A 2019 paper by the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists also found that 90% of Houston’s Manchester-Harrisburg community — whose residents are 90% Hispanic and 8% Black — lives within three miles of at least one industrial or toxic waste facility.But these trends aren’t unique to Houston.A 2017 report by the Clean Air Task Force and the NAACP concentrated on Black and brown “fence-line” communities ― that is, diverse communities that border oil and natural gas facilities. It found that more than 1 million Black Americans live within half a mile of these types of facilities. In the 91 U.S. counties that have a refinery or a facility that’s currently under construction, those facilities expose as many as 6.7 million Black Americans — 14% of the nation’s total Black population — to toxic and hazardous emissions.About 1 in 5 Black Americans lives near an oil or petroleum refinery, the report found.Southwest Crossing organizers say they don’t want to be the next statistic.“We’re not just an average community. We’re one that goes above and beyond to help each other,” Pack said. They’re looking to preserve Southwest Crossing for their “children, our grandchildren, to be able to live comfortably,” he said.More than anything, community members say they’re confused. Of all the places a facility like CenterPoint Energy’s could be built, why here — why in their backyards?“Historically, these types of facilities are hazardous to the environment and to people,” Stredic said. “We don’t want to accuse CenterPoint of making that type of move, but evidence is not speaking strongly towards that, either ... Until an emergency happens, or something is released in the air, it won’t necessarily be considered a hazard.”Their intention isn’t to hinder infrastructure.“We understand they want to better service this city, especially when we have adverse weather events,” Stredic said. “But it shouldn’t come at the cost of other people’s safety.”It’s unclear what options Southwest Crossing residents have at this point.In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Alejandra Diaz, a spokesperson for CenterPoint Energy, said company officials met with Houston Council Member Martha Castex-Tatum, whose district includes Southwest Crossing, last June. (Castex-Tatum’s office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.) Several more meetings took place last summer, followed by a three-week voluntary work stoppage at the facility’s construction site while the company responded to community concerns.“Throughout the process, CenterPoint Energy has remained committed to open communications with our customers and community members,” Diaz said. “We appreciate the communities’ support, and respect those who voiced their concerns. We have listened to those concerns and ensured they were addressed.”The Southwest Crossing organizers and their efforts are a version of the classic fight against “unwanted facilities in Black and brown communities,” said Dr. Denae King, a toxicologist at Texas Southern University whose work identifies community environmental health concerns in the region.But she noted that the community’s struggle with CenterPoint Energy is different, in that “by the time they realized, it was already approved; they’d started working on the area.”King worries most about scenarios involving a chain-reaction explosion. “It could be pretty catastrophic,” she said. Her sister-in-law lives in Southwest Crossing.That’s what Southwest Crossing residents have to consider each morning as they awake to the sound of construction equipment revving only about a football field away.There have been upsides, Stredic said. Their community feels more united than ever, bonded over a shared disturbance in the place they call home.“It’s brought a new sense of unity,” she said.There have also been losses. In January, Pack died unexpectedly.“We are still making progress despite our loss,” Stredic said. “Our goal is for them to shut it down and move it away from here.”"}, {"title": "Hundreds Of Thousands Of Puerto Ricans Still Without Power Amid Dayslong Outage", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans remained without electricity on Friday after a massive, dayslong power outage on the island.On Wednesday night, a circuit breaker at one of the island’s power plants caught fire, causing an island-wide outage.As of midday Friday, Luma Energy, the private company that is responsible for power transmission and distribution on the island, said that some 600,000 customers had had their power restored. This means that of the total 1.5 million households on the island, some 900,000 remained without power.“This is horrible,” Luisa Rosado, a mother of two who lives in San Juan, told The Associated Press on Thursday. She complained of recent increases in electricity bills, even as outages have been a problem for years.“To increase bills when you don’t provide a perfect service ... the level of impunity is absurd,” she added.The power company said its efforts to restore electricity to more households were expected to carry into the weekend.The outage was one of the largest since Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017, plunging many in the dark for months.

It was also, however, a rare opportunity for lawmakers to press major oil executives on what they are doing to combat climate change, which their industry has played an outsized role in driving.This week, a new United Nations report warned that global greenhouse gas emissions must peak no later than three years from now, then be slashed nearly in half by 2030 in order to stave off the worst effects of climate change.But that’s nothing to worry about, according to Republicans. Instead, two GOP members of the oversight and investigation subcommittee urged industry leaders to stop catering to environmentalists and instead double down on the very energy sources that have put the world on a path toward catastrophic and irreversible climatic change.Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) noted during the hearing that global energy demand is forecast to increase 50% by 2050 and declared that “renewables will never meet that demand — never.” He then rattled off a list of metals and other resources that would have to be mined and secured to transition from fossil fuels to renewables. And he touted the greenhouse gas emission reductions that could result if all coal-generated power were replaced with natural gas.“That’s the argument you should be making instead of behaving like you have Stockholm syndrome, like your civility to the radical environmentalists in Congress and this administration will one day get them to like you,” Crenshaw told the oil industry executives. “They will never like you.”“Please stand up for your work, your employees and your consumers,” he added. “Speak the truth. Don’t pander to what they want on the left, because Americans need you.”Among other things, Crenshaw’s comments ignore the suffering and devastation that climate change-fueled heat waves, drought and extreme weather are already causing around the globe — and that will grow worse with every additional degree of warming.Among the six executives who received Crenshaw’s pep talk were Chevron CEO Michael Wirth and ExxonMobil CEO Darren W. Woods. Chevron and ExxonMobil are both among the top 10 contributors to Crenshaw, donating $29,774 and $23,153, respectively. Crenshaw has received a total of $693,435 in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry over his career, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio), another huge beneficiary of industry campaign cash, gave an equally obsequious lecture, telling the executives they deserve thanks and praise for what they do “to keep the lights on” and “quite literally to fuel modern life as we know it in America.”“But there’s a problem,” Johnson said. “Many of you have big advertising budgets. Why won’t you tell that story? I’m not going to name names, but we’ve all seen the TV commercials from Big Oil, filled with solar panels, green climate messaging about how you’re diversifying your portfolio and how you’re embracing liberal, progressive values.”“What’s been your return on investment with that effort?” Johnson continued. “You’ve taken a shellacking today from the Democrats. Do they seem impressed by your efforts to show your allegiance to their anti-fossil fuel agenda?”Johnson fired off a series of yes-or-no questions about whether the executives are proud of the products and jobs they produce. After getting a series of yes answers, he called on the executives to use his line of questioning as a template for telling their story.He accused the industry of “chasing radical green progressive values.”The oil and gas sector has given Johnson $725,609 over his political career, more than any other industry.Earlier in the hearing, executives from BP and Shell touted their companies’ investments in renewable energy, including wind and solar, as well as the electrification of the automotive industry. But those investments pale in comparison to the amount of money the industry continues to funnel toward new fossil fuel production and projects.Republican lawmakers’ rhetoric about fossil fuels being superior to renewables — cheaper and more reliable — not only highlights the division in Washington over future energy policy, it also underscores one of the main takeaways from the new U.N. report: that the biggest obstacle to aggressive climate action is not technology or the affordability of renewables; it is political forces.Renewable energy is rapidly getting cheaper and more competitive. From 2010 to 2019, the price of solar energy and lithium-ion batteries fell 85%, while wind dropped 55%, according to the report.But politicians and conservative think tanks repeatedly attack green energy as not yet ready for prime time. A major example of right-wing climate misinformation played out last winter, when a powerful winter storm triggered blackouts across Texas. Crenshaw and Johnson joined a chorus of Republicans who initially blamed the grid outages on the failure of wind turbines and solar panels.“Bottom line: renewables don’t work well in extreme weather. Never will,” Crenshaw tweeted at the time. “Can we ever rely on renewables to power the grid during extreme weather? No, you need gas or nuclear.”In fact, the primary cause of the deadly blackouts wasn’t that renewables didn’t work in the extreme winter weather. It was that instruments froze at coal, nuclear and natural gas power plants.“Let me remind you, people die from lack of energy — and in large numbers,” Crenshaw said at Wednesday’s hearing. “I hope all that green compassion I always hear about has some answers for that.”He voiced no such hope that existing fossil fuel infrastructure would prove more reliable the next time Texas experiences extreme weather."}, {"title": "Jena Malone Chases Dog-Beating Suspect And Helps Recover Badly Injured Pooch", "text": "A dog rescued by “Hunger Games” actor Jena Malone while it was being beaten suffered another setback, a friend of the owner said Thursday.“Champ has more issues. he has a fracture in his chest.. they are needing to make sure [he’s] able to have surgery tomorow,” wrote the organizer of a GoFundMe page for the dog.On Twitter Wednesday, Malone, who recently had a recurring role on Amazon’s “Goliath,” recounted her pursuit of a man she saw kicking and choking the leashed dog in Hollywood.

(AP) — Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza.Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them.Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus, and zoos are working hard to prevent any of their birds from meeting the same fate. It would be especially upsetting for zoos to have to kill any of the endangered or threatened species in their care.“It would be extremely devastating,” said Maria Franke, who is the manager of welfare science at Toronto Zoo, which has less than two dozen Loggerhead Shrike songbirds that it’s breeding with the hope of reintroducing them into the wild. “We take amazing care and the welfare and well being of our animals is the utmost importance. There’s a lot of staff that has close connections with the animals that they care for here at the zoo.”Toronto Zoo workers are adding roofs to some outdoor bird exhibits and double-checking the mesh surrounding enclosures to ensure it will keep wild birds out.Birds shed the virus through their droppings and nasal discharge. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots and vehicles carrying supplies. Research has shown that small birds that squeeze into zoo exhibits or buildings can also spread the flu, and that mice can even track it inside.So far, no outbreaks have been reported at zoos, but there have been wild birds found dead that had the flu. For example, a wild duck that died in a behind-the-scenes area of the Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa, after tornadoes last month tested positive, zoo spokesman Ryan Bickel said.Most of the steps zoos are taking are designed to prevent contact between wild birds and zoo animals. In some places, officials are requiring employees to change into clean boots and don protective gear before entering bird areas.When bird flu cases are found in poultry, officials order the entire flock to be killed because the virus is so contagious. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that zoos might be able to avoid that by isolating infected birds and possibly euthanizing a small number of them.Sarah Woodhouse, director of animal health at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, said she is optimistic after talking with state and federal regulators.“They all agree that ordering us to depopulate a large part of our collection would be the absolute last-ditch effort. So they’re really interested in working with us to see what we can do to make sure that we’re not going to spread the disease while also being able to take care of our birds and not have to euthanize,” Woodhouse said.Among the precautions zoos are taking is to keep birds in smaller groups so that if a case is found, only a few would be affected. The USDA and state veterinarians would make the final decision about which birds had to be killed.“Euthanasia is really the only way to keep it from spreading,” said Luis Padilla, who is vice president of animal collections at the Saint Louis Zoo. “That’s why we have so many of these very proactive measures in place.”The National Aviary in Pittsburgh — the nation’s largest —- is providing individual health checks for each of its roughly 500 birds. Many already live in large glass enclosures or outdoor habitats where they don’t have direct exposure to wildlife, said Dr. Pilar Fish, the aviary’s senior director of veterinary medicine and zoological advancement.Kansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney said he’s heard a few complaints from visitors, but most people seem OK with not getting to see some birds. “I think our guests understand that we have what’s in the best interests of the animals in mind when we make these decisions even though they can’t get to see them,” Putney said.Officials emphasize that bird flu doesn’t jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.___Associated Press Writers David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa, Lindsay Whitehurst contributed from Salt Lake City, Julie Watson contributed from San Diego, Chris Grygiel contributed from Seattle and Tom Tait contributed from Las Vegas."}, {"title": "Ukraine Zoo Rushes To Evacuate Animals After Heavy Russian Shelling", "text": "A zoo in Kharkiv, Ukraine, is scrambling to evacuate the remainder of its animals after its infrastructure was severely damaged by Russian shelling.Feldman Ecopark “is no more,” founder Alexander Feldman said in a statement on Tuesday after the zoo was “subjected to massive shelling and bombardment” from Russian forces.The statement said the zoo’s “biggest problem” was large predators, such as lions, tigers and bears, which would pose a major danger to humans if they got out of the zoo and roamed free. Feldman said their enclosures were intact but couldn’t withstand more damage. For that reason, if the zoo can’t find a safe location for those animals to go, it may have to euthanize them.“It is unimaginably painful to talk about this, but the main priority now is the lives of people,” Feldman said.Feldman Ecopark emphasized in follow-up statements that euthanasia would be a last resort and that it was still attempting to evacuate animals.The logistics of transporting large zoo animals safely is complicated even under normal circumstances. During a war, supply shortages, road damage and the constant risk of shelling make it even harder. Many animals are in an intensely stressed-out state after a month of hearing shelling.Even so, in the last two days, workers have been able to evacuate multiple lions, a jaguar and a panther, the zoo said on social media alongside a video showing lions being transported. Many people in surrounding cities had stepped up to volunteer to assist however they could, the zoo noted on Facebook.Before this week, numerous animals had already been evacuated, including great apes, turtles, birds, alpacas, one of the lions and a van full of kangaroos and wallabies.

Where they fiercely disagree is on the barriers keeping that from happening.Rep. ​​Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, displayed a chart showing that while the price of crude oil has dropped in recent weeks, gasoline prices in the U.S. remain near historic highs.“Why?” she asked. “If the price of gas is driven by the global market, why is the price of oil coming down but the price at the pump is still at record highs?”“Something just doesn’t add up,” she added.Industry executives from Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron, Shell USA, Devon Energy Corp and Pioneer Resources said the global market controls prices, not individual companies, but struggled to explain the widening gap.“Changes in the price of crude oil do not always result in immediate changes at the pump,” said Mike Wirth, CEO of Chevron. He added that “it frequently takes more time for competition among retail stations to bring prices back down.”“It is a very complex set of factors that impact the price of gasoline,” including supply risk across all fossil fuel products, said David Lawler, president of BP America.Republicans on the committee ran to the industry’s defense. Reps. Morgan Griffith (Va.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) argued that the Biden administration’s “anti-American energy agenda” and “war” on fossil fuels are to blame for inflated prices.“It is impossible to generate confidence or invest in production today when future production is clearly being blocked by this administration,” Griffith said.Griffith asked each of the executives if their company was “taking advantage of the crisis in Ukraine to keep prices artificially high in order to increase your own profits?” All of them said they were not.“We have no tolerance for price-gouging,” Wirth, of Chevron, said in his opening remarks.But as DeGette and other Democrats on the panel pointed out, and as the executives acknowledged, the industry is raking in record profits. The six companies present Wednesday brought in a combined $75 billion in profits last year. And when the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas surveyed 139 industry executives last month, the majority — 59% — cited investor pressure as the main reason producers have not ramped up production.Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the industry is “ripping off the American people.”“At a time of record profits, big oil is refusing to increase production to provide the American people some much-needed relief at the gas pump. Instead, they are buying back their stock at an estimated $40 billion this year. Big oil is lining their pockets with one hand and taking millions in taxpayer subsidies with the other.”Stock buybacks are when a company uses its profits to buy up its own stock, often leading to a surge in the stock price. Pallone asked each of the executives if they would commit to reducing stock buybacks and dividends for shareholders, which would enable them to increase production instead amid ongoing turmoil in the energy market. None of them said they would.“I can’t commit to a reduction in buybacks,” Lawler said.Monday’s hearing and U.S. lawmakers’ push for more fossil fuel development come against the backdrop of a new United Nations report that warns global carbon emissions need to peak by 2025, then go down 43% by 2030, in order to prevent catastrophic planetary warming.Last week, Biden ordered the largest-ever release of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves — an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months — to combat high prices and act as a “wartime bridge” until domestic production can ramp up later this year. He also called on Congress to pass “use it or lose it” legislation requiring oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases.Highlighting the tightrope that Democrats are walking on energy ahead of the midterms later this year, when gas prices are likely to be high on voters’ minds, Pallone called on industry executives to “take some action to reduce the pain at the gas pump.”“Produce more oil,” he said on Wednesday. “Produce more with the wells you have.”"}, {"title": "Wind Energy Company Pleads Guilty To Killing 150 Eagles", "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A wind energy company was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay more than $8 million in fines and restitution after at least 150 eagles were killed over the past decade at its wind farms in eight states, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.NextEra Energy subsidiary ESI Energy pleaded guilty to three counts of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act during a Tuesday court appearance in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was charged in the deaths of eagles at three of its wind farms in Wyoming and New Mexico.In addition to those deaths, golden and bald eagles were killed at wind farms affiliated with ESI and NextEra since 2012 in eight states, prosecutors said: Wyoming, California, New Mexico, North Dakota, Colorado, Michigan, Arizona and Illinois. The birds are killed when they fly into the blades of wind turbines. Some ESI turbines killed multiple eagles, prosecutors said.It’s illegal to kill or harm eagles under federal law.The bald eagle — the U.S. national symbol — was removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act in 2007, following a dramatic recovery from its widespread decimation due to harmful pesticides and other problems. Golden eagles have not fared as well, with populations considered stable but under pressure including from wind farms, collisions with vehicles, illegal shootings and poisoning from lead ammunition.The case comes amid a push by President Joe Biden for more renewable energy from wind, solar and other sources to help reduce climate changing emissions. It also follows a renewed commitment by federal wildlife officials under Biden to enforce protections for eagles and other birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, after criminal prosecutions were halted under former President Donald Trump.Companies historically have been able to avoid prosecution if they take steps to avoid bird deaths and seek permits for those that occur. ESI did not seek such a permit, authorities said.The company was warned prior to building the wind farms in New Mexico and Wyoming that they would kill birds, but it proceeded anyway and at times ignored advice from federal wildlife officials about how to minimize the deaths, according to court documents.“For more than a decade, ESI has violated (wildlife) laws, taking eagles without obtaining or even seeking the necessary permit,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division in a statement.ESI agreed under a plea agreement to spend up to $27 million during its five-year probationary period on measures to prevent future eagle deaths. That includes shutting down turbines at times when eagles are more likely to be present.Despite those measures, wildlife officials anticipate that some eagles still could die. When that happens, the company will pay $29,623 per dead eagle, under the agreement.NextEra President Rebecca Kujawa said collisions of birds with wind turbines are unavoidable accidents that should not be criminalized. She said the company is committed to reducing damage to wildlife from its projects.“We disagree with the government’s underlying enforcement activity,” Kujawa said in a statement. “Building any structure, driving any vehicle, or flying any airplane carries with it a possibility that accidental eagle and other bird collisions may occur.”"}, {"title": "Trump Tilts At Windmills", "text": ""}, {"title": "Fox Tests Positive For Rabies After Biting Multiple People On Capitol Hill (UPDATED)", "text": "A female fox that was captured and killed after biting multiple people on Capitol Hill has posthumously tested positive for rabies.“The DC Public Health lab has confirmed the fox that was captured yesterday tested positive for the rabies virus,” the D.C. Department of Health said in a statement sent to HuffPost, adding that it will contact anyone who reported a bite.The fox was “responsible for 9 confirmed bites on Capitol Hill” and was “humanely euthanized” to be tested for rabies, the department said in an earlier statement on Wednesday.Because a rabies test involves brain tissue, it can’t be conducted on a living animal. Foxes are known carriers of rabies, and D.C. law states that wild animals that cause a potential rabies exposure in a person or another animal must be killed so they can be tested for the deadly virus.Three fox kits were also found and captured. Officials determined they needed to be euthanized as well, because of the likelihood that they also had rabies.“Since the mother tested positive for the rabies virus and the kits could have been exposed during grooming or other means, they were no longer able to be safely rehabilitated and were humanely euthanized,” the health department said Thursday.Animal control officers caught the mother fox on Tuesday after multiple reports of bites, including an “unprovoked” one on Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.). Shortly afterward, Bera began receiving a course of the post-exposure rabies vaccine.Anyone who has had a potential rabies exposure should seek medical help immediately, and will almost certainly need to begin a post-exposure vaccine regimen. The vaccine prevents people from actually developing rabies. However, if a person does not get the vaccine and begins developing rabies symptoms, the disease is almost always fatal.Only a tiny number of people have ever survived rabies, and they did so after undergoing an intensive procedure involving an induced coma.DC Health urged anyone who had contact with the fox to call the department at 202-442-9143.This story has been updated throughout."}, {"title": "Fox Captured At U.S. Capitol Could Be Killed For Rabies Testing", "text": "A female red fox suspected of biting people near the U.S. Capitol building was captured by animal control officers Tuesday — and she may be killed for rabies testing under Washington, D.C., law.Capitol Police announced the fox’s capture on Twitter alongside several photos of the animal.

Ami Bera (D-Calif.), who told Heather Caygle of Punchbowl News that the attack was “unprovoked” and the fox lunged at the back of his leg.“Our officers will be taking steps to ensure the correct fox has been captured,” Sam Miller of the Humane Rescue Alliance, the nonprofit that’s contracted to run D.C.’s animal care and control facility, told HuffPost.But if the captured fox is the right one, it’s not exactly clear what will happen. U.S. Capitol police said in its tweet that that animal control officers “are working to trap and relocate any foxes they find.” When reached by HuffPost, a police spokesperson said the fox’s fate is a question for animal control.When asked whether killing the fox was on the table, Miller referred HuffPost to D.C. regulations on wildlife bites. The law states that “wildlife that has bitten a person or animal, or caused a potential rabies exposure to a person or animal” must be euthanized immediately for rabies testing. (Because rabies testing involves brain tissue, it cannot be performed on a living animal.)The D.C. Department of Health did not immediately respond to requests for comment from HuffPost.The captured fox was female, Miller said, and animal control officers are working to find out if she had any kits in the area.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Capitol Police captured the fox.

Air quality is poorest in WHO’s eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asia regions, followed by Africa, it said.“After surviving a pandemic, it is unacceptable to still have 7 million preventable deaths and countless preventable lost years of good health due to air pollution,” said Dr. Maria Neira, head of WHO’s department of environment, climate change and health. “Yet too many investments are still being sunk into a polluted environment rather than in clean, healthy air.”The database, which has traditionally considered two types of particulate matter known as PM2.5 and PM10, for the first time has included ground measurements of nitrogen dioxide. The last version of the database was issued in 2018.Nitrogen dioxide originates mainly from human-generated burning of fuel, such as through automobile traffic, and is most common in urban areas. Exposure can bring respiratory disease like asthma and symptoms like coughing, wheezing and difficulty in breathing, and more hospital and emergency-room admissions, WHO said. The highest concentrations were found in the eastern Mediterranean region.On Monday, the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus suffered through high concentrations of atmospheric dust for the third straight day, with some cities experiencing three and nearly four times the 50 micrograms per square meter that authorities consider normal. Officials said the microscopic particles could be especially harmful to young children, the elderly and the ill.Particulate matter has many sources, such as transportation, power plants, agriculture, the burning of waste and industry – as well as from natural sources like desert dust. The developing world is particularly hard hit: India had high levels of PM10, while China showed high levels of PM2.5, the database showed.“Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, is capable of penetrating deep into the lungs and entering the bloodstream, causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular (stroke) and respiratory impacts,” WHO said. “There is emerging evidence that particulate matter impacts other organs and causes other diseases as well.”The findings highlight the sheer scale of the changes needed to combat air pollution, said Anumita Roychowdhury, an air pollution expert at Center for Science and Environment, a research organization in New Delhi.India and the world need to brace for major changes to try to curb air pollution, including using electric vehicles, shifting away from fossil fuels, embracing a massive scaling-up of green energy and separating out types of waste, she said.The Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that more than 60% of India’s PM2.5 loads are from households and industries. Tanushree Ganguly, who heads the council’s program on air quality, called for action toward reducing emissions from industries, automobiles, biomass burning and domestic energy.“We need to prioritize clean energy access for households that need it the most, and take active measures to clean up our industrial sector,” she said.___Follow all AP stories on climate change issues at https://apnews.com/hub/climate.___Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi contributed to this report."}, {"title": "‘Now Or Never’: New U.N. Report Sees Narrow Path For Averting Climate Catastrophe", "text": "For the world to have any chance of preventing catastrophic climate change, it needs an immediate, collective and herculean effort to phase out fossil fuels and rein in greenhouse gas emissions.And even if humanity pulls it off, planetary warming is likely to at least temporarily soar past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the aspirational goal of the landmark Paris climate accords.That is the conclusion of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report, published Monday, focusing on what is required to tackle a threat that is already causing suffering and devastation around the globe. Although there are signs of climate action, the world remains wildly short of meeting international goals.“It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C,” Jim Skea, who co-chairs the panel that authored the report, said in a statement. “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”To achieve the 1.5-degree target, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 and then be cut approximately 43% below 2019 levels by the end of the decade, and 84% by 2050, the IPCC said.That is a monumental task. Human greenhouse gas emissions were 12% higher in 2019 than in 2010, and policies implemented at the end of 2020 have put the planet on course to a devastating 3.2 degrees of warming. Existing and soon-to-be-built fossil fuel infrastructure are forecast to spew enough pollution into the atmosphere in the coming years to put the 1.5-degree target out of reach.“Increased action must begin this year, not next year; this month, not next month; and indeed today, not tomorrow,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. environment program, said at a news conference announcing the findings. “Otherwise we will ... continue to sleepwalk into a climate catastrophe.”As the report highlights, the solution is clear: The world, in particular wealthy nations that are responsible for the vast majority of emissions, must stop investing in dirty energy and move quickly to replace coal, oil and gas with renewables, like solar and wind.Political forces continue to be the biggest obstacles to aggressive action.“The interaction between politics, economics and power relationships is central to explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action,” reads a technical document accompanying the report.The sobering assessment comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine threatens to further delay efforts to confront climate change in the U.S. and abroad. The Biden administration has set ambitious climate goals, but is now facing pressure to boost domestic oil and gas production in order to combat rising energy costs and assist European allies as they scramble to reduce their reliance on Russian petroleum.António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, recently warned that the conflict in Eastern Europe could be the death knell for limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees. And at Monday’s news conference, he said the report is “a litany of broken promises” and “a file of shame.”“Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals,” Guterres said. “But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.”Monday’s report, authored by 278 experts from 65 countries, is the third installment of the IPCC’s sixth global assessment. The second report, published in February, analyzed climate impacts and vulnerabilities, and warned that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than previously known. The window to “secure a livable and sustainable future for all” is rapidly closing, that document said.Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development and a peer-reviewer of the new report, said the world is facing a “do-or-die moment.”“If the last report from the Sixth Assessment was an atlas of human suffering and failed leadership, this report is an atlas of human hope and the last chance for the leadership we need from the heads of State to return to a safe climate,” Zaelke said in a statement.John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, said the report “represents a defining moment for our planet.”“Every country must move further and faster,” Kerry said in a statement. “Faster means rapidly upscaling deployment of renewable energy. Faster means targeting methane emissions. Faster means reducing demand and focusing on efficiency. Faster means halting and reversing global deforestation. Faster means demanding more sustainable transit.”“Choosing the more sustainable option is not only the right thing to do, but the IPCC has shown it is now the more affordable choice,” Kerry added."}, {"title": "Russia Crisis Should 'Supercharge' Climate Efforts In Build Back Better 2.0: Memo", "text": "A progressive climate group is looking to thrust Russia’s war and its impact on the global energy market to the center of any revived talks on President Joe Biden’s “Build Back Better” plan, lobbying for the inclusion of more than a dozen investments to boost clean energy and reduce U.S. reliance on oil and gas.After killing the original version of the massive climate and social spending package last year, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) recently signaled his willingness to come to the table on a pared-down version, as long as it specifically focuses on climate change, prescription drug prices and cutting the federal deficit. The $1.7 trillion reconciliation package that House Democrats passed in November included approximately $555 billion in total climate spending.In a memo shared with HuffPost and set to be distributed to officials on Capitol Hill and in the White House, climate advocacy group Evergreen Action outlined 15 specific climate investments that were part of the House-approved bill that it hopes to see prioritized in any resurrected version. The group says those provisions would go a long way toward speeding up the transition to renewable energies and breaking free of a global oil and gas market that is empowering Russian President Vladimir Putin and other bad actors.“We want to connect the dots here, to galvanize more support for Congress to take the action that they need to actually solve this problem,” Lena Moffitt, the group’s chief of staff, told HuffPost. “The war in Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian tragedy that is unfolding and has captured everyone’s attention, and is also spotlighting one more reason why we need to get off of fossil fuels.”“It just so happens that Congress is considering a bill that would supercharge our ability to do so,” Moffitt added.While Evergreen Action supports the full suite of climate provisions in the now-stalled Build Back Better Act, its memo spotlights those that would have the most immediate impact on reducing U.S. demand for oil and gas. They include tax credits on everything from electric vehicles and solar panel manufacturing to energy efficient buildings and green hydrogen production; huge investments to decarbonize the industrial, building and manufacturing sectors and electrify the fleet of federal vehicles; and $29 billion for a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to jump-start the deployment of clean energy infrastructure.The memo cites a recent survey from think tank Data for Progress that found over two-thirds of all likely voters support federal investments to advance clean energy in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It also cites a study from policy firm Energy Innovation that concluded the climate provisions in Biden’s Build Back Better would reduce U.S. oil consumption enough by 2027 to offset the amount of Russian oil imported into the U.S. last year.“The takeaway is clear: passing bold investments in electrification and clean energy offers the best pathway to cut U.S. demand for fossil fuels, protect American families’ bottom lines, and end our dependence on authoritarian petrostates,” the Evergreen memo reads.Last month, Evergreen took aim at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), releasing a video demanding that he deliver on his promise to “forcefully, insistently and urgently” address climate change via a climate spending bill. The group doubled down on that pressure in Monday’s memo, writing, “President Biden and Majority Leader Schumer must get a deal done, and get the climate provisions of the House-passed reconciliation bill through now.”Dozens of House Democrats sent Biden a letter in mid-March calling on him to restart reconciliation negotiations, with climate as his primary goal. Reconciliation is a special budget process that only requires 51 votes to make it through the Senate.Biden has faced enormous pressure from both sides of the aisle in recent weeks. Republicans are demanding that he “unleash” U.S. oil and gas production to combat rising energy costs and help European allies reduce reliance on Russian oil, while Democrats are largely calling on him to move even more quickly toward renewable sources of energy.Last week, Biden ordered a massive release from the nation’s strategic oil reserves — up to 1 million barrels per day for the next six months — to provide relief from high gas prices, but stressed that the ongoing crisis highlights the urgent need for the kind of climate and clean energy investments in his stalled plan.“Ultimately, we and the whole world need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels altogether,” Biden said. “We need to choose long-term security over energy and climate vulnerability. We need to double down on our commitment to clean energy and tackling the climate crisis with our partners and allies around the world.”“We need to embrace all the tools and technologies that could help us free us from our dependence on fossil fuels.”Read the memo below:"}, {"title": "Inside The Contentious Leadership Battle At The Nation’s Biggest Environmental Group", "text": "The intense internal conflicts that have roiled the Sierra Club for the better part of a year will come to a head April 27, when the organization’s roughly 780,000 members finish voting for five candidates to sit on its 15-person board. The election features a group of insurgent petition candidates vying against a slate the majority of the current board supports in a fight over the future of America’s most iconic environmental organization.The four petition candidates, who had to gather signatures to get on the ballot, are running on a platform to “save the Sierra Club” from a board that they contend has engaged in “top-down,” “ideologically-driven” governance, while “censoring and silencing” the club’s grassroots volunteers.Six board-backed candidates, running as the “Forward Sierra” slate, say that their opponents are intent on reversing or slowing “many of the critical efforts underway to make us a stronger, more unified and more inclusive organization.” Both sides describe the election as the most important in years.The vote comes in the wake of a series of controversies over race and identity, workplace culture, organizational structure and the legacy of the organization’s founder, John Muir, a longtime symbol of the environmental movement.In the summer of 2020, then-Executive Director Michael Brune published a statement on the Sierra Club website that effectively portrayed Muir as a racist, titling the piece “Pulling Down Our Monuments” and apologizing for what he described as the club’s “substantial role in perpetuating white supremacy.”The piece kicked off internal conflict that burst into public view in 2021, when three prominent leaders — Aaron Mair, the club’s first African American president; Mary Ann Nelson, the first African American elected to the club’s national board; and Chad Hanson, a well-known forest ecologist and activist — published a lengthy defense of Muir’s record and reputation.“It’s important to think critically about our movement’s historical figures, John Muir included,” the trio wrote. “However, some recent articles by environmentalists and environmental writers — though perhaps guided by good intentions, and well-written and researched in other respects — contain some inaccurate and unfounded information that could create damaging divisions among the conservation movement and environmental justice advocates.”The group had initially sought to publish its defense in the Sierra Club’s magazine, but the board voted to prohibit them from doing so. They then turned to the Earth Island Journal, which published their piece in August 2021. The trio also spoke to Politico about their views.They were ultimately punished in November 2021 when the board majority passed a pair of “accountability resolutions” that officially admonished Mair and Hanson, who were, and still are, board members and accused them of causing “significant and ongoing harm” to the club.The board majority subsequently declined to back Mair in his reelection bid this year. Hanson is not yet up for reelection.The spectacle of the club’s first African American president and others being censored and admonished for publicly defending Muir did not sit well with some members ― and it helped give rise to the petition slate that is challenging the current board leadership.Among them was Michael Dorsey, an environmental scientist who previously served for 11 years on the Sierra Club’s national board and who has now joined Mair as one of the four insurgent candidates.“We don’t have time for that kind of stuff,” said Dorsey, given the pressing need to fight the climate crisis and to tackle environmental injustice. The club, Dorsey said, needs “a course correction at the top.”Dorsey and Mair are running on the petition slate alongside Kathryn Bartholomew, a grassroots volunteer leader from New York, and Maya Khosla, a wildlife biologist, writer and forest activist from California.Another prominent club member incensed by the Muir incident: the bestselling science-fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson.“I was amazed that the Sierra Club Board of Directors had been so foolish as to try to censor their own people who sought to make a statement in defense of their founder,” Robinson told HuffPost. “It challenged my sense of what this group’s intelligence and motivations actually were.”“Really, I think the whole board of directors ought to resign after what they did in response to the essay by Mair, Hanson and Nelson,” he added. “They ought to say, ‘Oops, collective moment of insanity. We ruined the reputation of the club, and we are going to resign now and let a new group take over.’”Robinson, whose forthcoming book involved deep research into Muir, helped gather signatures to get the petition candidates on the ballot.The Muir controversy, though, is not the only issue in this election fight. Around the same time that Mair and his co-authors published their article, both The Intercept and Politico published the executive summary of an internal Sierra Club report that described “a culture at the Sierra Club that tolerated, excused, or failed to correct those managers and leaders who regularly displayed anger and aggression — yelling, berating, shaming, and otherwise demonstrating unprofessional and abusive behavior in the workplace.”The report emphasized the club’s need to do more to fulfill its professed “commitment to equity and inclusion” and to address “culture concerns.”Ramona Strategies, an outside consulting firm that declined to comment for this article, authored the report. In order to further the “cultural transformation underway” at the Sierra Club, the consultants made several recommendations to leadership.Perhaps the most controversial was their “strong recommendation” that the organization “no longer delegate [managerial authority] to volunteers; all employees should be managed by and subject to the oversight of individuals also under the organization’s clear control and direction as employees.” This issue, more than anything, seems to be at the center of the current board election.The board-backed candidates say on their website that they are “deeply committed to our mission and to creating an inclusive environment for volunteers and staff.”“We need to make sure the Club is reaching everyone and feels welcome for people of all backgrounds,” Brian Gómez, a sitting national board member who is running for reelection on the board-backed slate, said in a written statement.Mair said the petition slate agrees that inclusiveness at the club is paramount and that any harassment, bullying or other inappropriate behavior must be taken seriously and remedied.But Mair and his allies oppose what they believe is a board and staff effort to strip authority from the club’s thousands of grassroots volunteers, including scores of volunteer-controlled state chapters that have historically operated semi-autonomously. State chapters can elect their own leaders, hire their own staff and set their own priorities.“This is not a disagreement over whether racism and sexism and harassment should be punished and dealt with,” Mair told HuffPost. “It is a disagreement over the management authority and due process rights of grassroots volunteers .… It is an attack on their rights to lead and run the local organizations that they have created.”“First they canceled Muir,” he said, “now they want to cancel the power of the volunteers.”As an example, he pointed to a resolution the board majority passed last year that initiated a “multi-year transition” that he believes will remove the primacy of state chapter volunteer leadership in managing their chapter staff, a longstanding Sierra Club tradition. The new “co-lead” model described in the resolution will give national staff more power over chapter personnel and priorities, Mair said.He also pointed to sweeping punitive actions the national organization has taken in recent months against grassroots volunteers, including its moves to suspend or threaten suspension of entire elected state chapter governing bodies in places like Colorado and Oregon. In the Colorado case, the board has accused the chapter’s governing body of a “harmful and non-inclusive” management culture, among other allegations, according to a letter HuffPost obtained.One longtime Colorado chapter member and leader, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, pushed back on those allegations, calling them unsubstantiated. She thinks the national organization’s threat to suspend Colorado’s volunteer leadership is based primarily on policy disagreements.“Historically, the Sierra Club has been a volunteer-run organization, and staff take their direction from volunteers as far as what is prioritized in conservation campaigns. That has been a historical model,” she said. “I think that is a model they want to change, and the easiest way is to get rid of volunteer leadership that doesn’t agree with that.”Marcia Hanscom, a former national board member and current volunteer leader in the club’s Angeles Chapter in Southern California, said such issues of organizational structure and governance are at the heart of this election.“A lot of folks are very upset that we are going to lose our democratic organization,” she said. “People feel the grassroots leadership is at serious risk.”Some of the largest Sierra Club chapters in the country, including the Angeles Chapter, the Atlantic Chapter in New York state, the Colorado Chapter, the New Jersey Chapter and the Pennsylvania Chapter, have endorsed all or a majority of the petition slate.The national board majority, led by President Ramón Cruz, has endorsed Gómez as well as the other five members of the “Forward Sierra” slate, including Cheyenne Skye Branscum, a member from Oklahoma, Cynthia Hoyle, a member from Illinois, and Shruti Bhatnagar, a volunteer leader from Maryland.When asked by HuffPost about the autonomy and authority of state chapter governing bodies, Hervé Jean-Baptiste, another board-backed candidate, said in an email that he supports “initiatives that empower chapters to build and invest in grassroots power. The club’s commitment to this has not wavered.”Allison Chin, another member of the board-backed slate, echoed his perspective, saying that she supports “investments that build chapter capacity and grassroots empowerment.”Among other endorsements, the board-backed slate also has the support of the Progressive Workers Union, which represents about 400 Sierra Club staffers. The union had denounced Mair and Hanson for their statements about John Muir last year.Ramón Cruz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The club’s national communications office had not provided comment at the time of publication. Representatives of the Progressive Workers Union also did not provide on-the-record comment for this article.  A memo from the club’s national communications office circulated among board members and volunteer leaders on an open listserv late last year ― which HuffPost has reviewed ― instructed them not to respond to inquiries from this reporter and others looking into the organization’s internal affairs.All four petition candidates, some of them fearful of being sanctioned for speaking to the press, made clear that statements provided for this article represented their personal opinions, not the views or policies of the Sierra Club itself.Despite their differences, all sides seemed to agree on at least one thing: The country needs a strong and committed Sierra Club if it is to tackle the climate and extinction crises."}, {"title": "Maine Farmers Ship Millions Of Pounds Of Potatoes West To Help After Drought", "text": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine’s potato growers had such a bumper crop this past season that they stepped in to help their big brothers out west who were short on spuds.Farmers from Maine shipped potatoes by rail for the first time in four decades this winter thanks to a strong harvest in the state and heat and dry weather that stymied farmers in renowned potato-growing states like Idaho and Washington. The potatoes made their way more than 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) for processing, riding in climate-controlled rail cars.All told, 21 million pounds (9.5 million kilograms) of potatoes, virtually all from growers in northern Maine, flowed through a rail-connected warehouse owned by LaJoie Growers LLC. That equates to more than 530 truckloads of potatoes, said co-owner Jay LaJoie.“It’s a good chunk of potatoes,” said Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board.Most of the Maine potatoes went to processors in Washington state, where much of the french fries and other products are exported. The shipments to Idaho were seed potatoes, including Maine’s Caribou russet, that’ll be planted this spring.Chris Voigt from the Washington State Potato Commission said processors were grateful for the potato shipments, but they’re hopeful Maine growers’ services aren’t required in the future.The shipments came to an early end about two weeks ago, party because of economic disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine. But it was good while it lasted, helping out potato processors in western states while reducing an oversupply of Maine spuds.It also proved the value of rail lines for agriculture, especially during a shortage of trucks in the pandemic, LaJoie said.There’s no way growers could have sourced enough tractor-trailers to haul the potatoes, but there happened to be an available rail line that connects to a LaJoie-owned warehouse in Van Buren.The shortage of truck drivers has contributed to supply-chain problems during the pandemic.“I don’t see transportation getting better anytime soon,” LaJoie said.While Maine is known for its famous lobsters, the state was indeed once the nation’s potato capital through World War II. Other states later stepped up production in the 1950s. Idaho and Washington State are currently Nos. 1 and 2 while Maine ranks ninth, according to the USDA.The unusual shortage of potatoes out west is a result of weird summer weather.A heat wave with temperatures soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) hit the Pacific Northwest in June, just as potatoes were starting to grow. The result was reduced yields, and lower quality, Voigt said.“The plants sort of shut down,” he said.The extreme heat reduced yields by nearly 10% for potato growers in Idaho and Washington, while Maine potato yields grew more than 30% thanks to good weather, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.In northern Maine, the harvest was so big that growers scrambled to find storage. Some buildings at the former Loring Air Force Base were enlisted for a last-minute home for the abundant tubers.In the end, it proved to be a successful pilot program for rail delivery that could be used again if unusual weather patterns persist, LaJoie said. Plus Maine enjoyed getting some attention for its potato industry thanks to the irony of David rendering aid to the potato Goliaths."}, {"title": "More Than 5 Million Chickens In Iowa Slated To Be Killed Over Bird Flu", "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Bird flu has infected two more farms in Iowa, forcing the killing of 5.3 million hens and 88,000 turkeys, officials said Friday.The new cases mean that across the nation, farmers have had to kill about 22 million egg-laying chickens, 1.8 million broiler chickens, 1.9 million pullet and other commercial chickens, and 1.9 million turkeys. Iowa accounts for many of those cases, with operations having to kill more than 18 million chickens and 305,000 turkeys since the outbreaks began a month ago.Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer and had 46 million chickens on farms in February, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Iowa raises about 11.7 million turkeys annually.The latest cases were at an egg farm in Osceola County and a turkey farm in Cherokee County, both in northwest Iowa. Earlier this week, state officials also confirmed the virus on a turkey farm with 35,500 birds in Buena Vista County.Because  the virus is so infectious and deadly for commercial poultry, entire flocks are destroyed and composted on the farms when they are infected.USDA data shows 23 states have confirmed cases in commercial or backyard flocks.Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Infected wild birds have been found in at least 26 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of the avian influenza virus have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products. Cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F kills bacteria and viruses."}, {"title": "Biden’s Global Climate Agenda Is On The Ropes As Europe Goes To War And The Right Digs In", "text": "Last April, President Joe Biden convened dozens of world leaders for a “virtual climate summit” that sought to generate more ambitious environmental policies ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference later in the year. The summit, held on an occasionally glitchy Zoom call, sought to prove that Biden would restore the climate credibility the U.S. had lost under President Donald Trump, and make it a leader in the global fight against catastrophic planetary warming.Biden has made a series of moves meant to bolster that aim. He returned the U.S. to the 2015 Paris climate accords, pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half before 2030 and to net-zero by midcentury, and issued numerous executive orders to help achieve those goals.But 14 months into his presidency and a year since the summit, Biden is facing Russia’s war in Ukraine, rising global oil and gasoline prices, and the intransigence of climate change skeptics both at home and abroad ― and they are now threatening to derail his climate agenda altogether.Since launching his campaign for president, Biden has pledged to make climate change a centerpiece of both his domestic and foreign policy strategies. He would push countries like Brazil, where right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has presided over record levels of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, to change course, while simultaneously enacting the most ambitious domestic climate agenda in American history.His early moves, and promises of further legislative and executive action to come, did succeed in bolstering U.S. climate credibility on the international stage, particularly among major European leaders who had been dismayed by Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris accords, his formation of a convenient anti-climate alliance with Bolsonaro, and the United States’ general turn against any form of aggressive climate action.“There is a lot more credibility in the way that the U.S. wants to adopt an environmentally friendly policy,” said one European official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the Biden administration’s climate approach. “But there are also some difficulties in the implementation.”The opening three months of 2022 have shown just how big those difficulties are.Data released in January showed that U.S. carbon emissions rose sharply last year after a pandemic-driven downturn the year prior, highlighting the struggles Biden may face in curbing emissions overall as the U.S. economy bounces back to life. In early February, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) announced his opposition to Biden’s Build Back Better plan, a sweeping legislative proposal that initially included $555 billion in climate-related spending, derailing what would have amounted to the largest package of climate-focused initiatives in U.S. history.The same month, a surge of deforestation destroyed an area of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest equivalent in size to Washington, D.C. ― a record for the month of February ― all while Brazilian lawmakers launched a legislative push that could open even more of the forest to industrialization and destruction.And in the final week of February, Russia launched an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, sparking a crisis that, beyond its humanitarian implications, has also exacerbated oil supply crunches. In response, Republicans have demanded the U.S. “unleash” domestic fossil fuel production, while some Democrats have begged the Biden administration to abandon efforts to pass climate legislation, fearing it could crater the party’s hopes in looming midterm elections. Last week, Biden ordered the largest-ever release of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves — an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months — to combat high prices and act as a “wartime bridge” until domestic production can ramp up later this year.The developments have put Biden’s planned international climate agenda in serious jeopardy.“It damages our credibility abroad when you have sweeping campaign promises being made … and then nothing happens,” said Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at Oil Change International, a climate advocacy group. “You can only be the boy who cried wolf so many times on the international stage.”Brazil has long been at the center of Biden’s desire to make climate a foreign policy focus. During a presidential debate in 2020, he pledged to create a $20 billion international fund to help protect the Brazilian Amazon, and cited rampant destruction of the forest as a key failure of Trump’s foreign policy approach.But shifting geopolitical circumstances and the right wing’s fervent allegiance to fossil fuels and environmental exploitation have inhibited those plans almost from the beginning.Early in his presidency, Biden signed a climate-focused executive order that tasked his administration with developing a plan to “promote the protection of the Amazon rainforest and other critical ecosystems that serve as global carbon sinks.” And he sent former Secretary of State John Kerry, who now serves as Biden’s special climate envoy, and other key U.S. officials to Brasília for diplomatic talks meant to persuade the Bolsonaro government to abandon its most destructive policies.Negotiating better forest protections with Bolsonaro, a climate change denialist who has spent his presidency rolling back regulations and incentivizing deforestation, was always going to prove difficult. But it also offered an opportunity. By bringing Brazil, which had drastically reduced emissions and improved its rainforest protections in the past, back to the table, the U.S. could also prove its own bona fides.The on-again, off-again negotiations, during which Brazilian officials repeatedly insisted they needed advance payments to protect the forest, eventually resulted in a cursory pledge from the Bolsonaro government to put an end to illegal deforestation by 2028, two years earlier than Brazil had previously said it would.Throughout the process, Brazilian environmental experts and Indigenous tribes warned the U.S. not to trust Bolsonaro, who they feared would simply legalize deforestation now considered illegal and use any positive outcome ― and financial benefit ― to bolster his own political prospects.“The problem in the country is not money, the problem is the government,” said Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a São Paulo-based environmental organization. “We have the money. We don’t have a government willing to face deforestation.”Still, the pledge came at a time when it may have seemed possible to “shift Bolsonaro’s focus,” said Mark Langevin, an expert on Brazilian energy and environmental policy at George Mason University in Virginia. He had replaced a hard-line environmental minister with an official many observers had hoped would approach the job more pragmatically. The reputational damage caused by a record outbreak of fires in 2019, and Bolsonaro’s persistent denials that they were even occurring, had also driven some modern elements of Brazil’s influential agribusiness industry to begin pushing the government to change its approach.Since the agreement, however, Bolsonaro has proceeded the way most environmental experts assumed he would. Brazil’s Congress is already considering a package of legislative proposals favored by Bolsonaro that would allow more large mining projects on protected Indigenous territories in the Amazon and ease regulations over the use of harmful pesticides, The Guardian reported in March. The bills could also lead to another surge in illegal land grabbing, a practice that has helped drive deforestation and violent attacks on Indigenous communities under Bolsonaro, thanks to his government’s lax enforcement of the law and its close ties to garimpeiros ― wildcat miners who have scoured the Amazon for its resources.Even as the forest faces ever-graver threats, Russia’s war appears to have shifted U.S. attention at least for the moment away from deforestation and toward another sensitive environmental topic.After the invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. placed broad new economic sanctions on Russia, including a ban on the import of all Russian fossil fuels. That has sent domestic gas prices ― already on the rise thanks to increased demand at home ― to record highs, which could have drastic political ramifications for Biden and the Democratic Party later this year.In an effort to prevent those increases, the Biden administration has sought to replace lost Russian fuel via other sources, including Brazil. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm urged her Brazilian counterpart, Bento Albuquerque, to boost oil production in a mid-March phone call. Albuquerque immediately agreed, he told Agence France-Presse.That’s a major priority for Bolsonaro, who has sought to paint the Russian war as “a good opportunity” to loosen environmental protections, boost oil production and ramp up mining on Indigenous territories within the Amazon that are rich in potassium, which could be used to produce fertilizer. (Brazil imports most of its fertilizer from Russia.)Brazil has plenty of company in seeking to leverage the crisis to bolster domestic industries. Australia and other coal-producing countries are embracing a surge in coal demand as European nations look to replace supplies from Russia. And Biden, who campaigned on a pledge to “take on the fossil fuel industry,” is facing a pressure campaign from that sector and allied Republicans to boost domestic production of oil and gas in order to combat rising energy costs and assist European allies as they seek to reduce reliance on Russian oil.But the posture toward Bolsonaro demonstrates the ways that Russia’s invasion complicated an already fragile global climate agenda.“The politics of climate, domestically and internationally, are so challenging,” Langevin said. “And now, all eyes are on Ukraine, which just takes all the oxygen out of the room.”It has shifted the U.S. posture elsewhere too. Last month, Biden announced plans to boost exports of liquified natural gas to help Europe transition off of Russian gas, which accounts for 40% of Europe’s supply. The deal with Europe, the administration argued, would speed the continent’s transition away from dirty energy sources altogether.“The president knows ... that the true path to energy security runs through clean energy, so that’s the second part of this agreement,” a senior administration official said on a call with reporters last month. “The first part is getting Europe off Russian gas. The second part is getting Europe off gas altogether. And he’s committed to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and reaping the climate, environmental, economic and energy security benefits of moving decisively down that path.”But it also horrified climate groups in the U.S., who fear it will lead to a large-scale build-out of gas infrastructure and lock in years if not decades of pollution from what is already one of the key drivers of climate change. Methane, the main component of natural gas, accounts for one-third of all human-caused planetary warming.The fossil fuel industry, by contrast, applauded the move.This is the fine line the White House has walked both domestically and internationally: On the one hand, it has repeatedly stressed that Russia’s war is a reminder that the U.S. must speed up its transition to renewable energies in order to break free of a global oil and gas market that empowers bad actors and determines prices at home and abroad.On the other, it has responded to the Republican misinformation campaign about Biden being “at war with” fossil fuels by arguing that the administration has given the industry the tools it needs to increase domestic production. In a speech announcing a U.S. ban on imports of Russian fossil fuels, Biden noted that U.S. oil and gas companies pumped more during his first year than during Trump’s, that production is forecast to reach a record high in 2023, and that the industry has stockpiled more than 9,000 unused but approved permits to drill across millions of acres of federal lands.“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,” Biden said.The administration is pointing the finger at U.S. drillers for high prices at the pump, even accusing them of profiteering, while simultaneously trying to appease the industry. Granholm has called on producers to “rise to meet current demand” amid Russia’s invasion. And speaking to a room full of energy industry executives at the CERAWeek conference in Houston last month, Kerry said the Biden administration is committed to an “all of the above” future energy policy.It’s a pro-everything strategy that both Democrats and Republicans have championed for more than two decades, but that is increasingly out of sync with climate science. A report last month concluded that the U.S. and other wealthy, heavy-polluting nations must phase out oil and gas production altogether by 2034 if the world is to have a 50% chance of limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the landmark Paris climate agreement.António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, recently warned that the war and ensuing pursuit of “all-of-the-above” energy could be the death knell for limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees.“Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or kneecap policies to cut fossil fuel use,” he said. “Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.”A White House spokesperson said Biden has not wavered in his push for climate action, but said in the short term energy supply must keep up with demand.“We believe we can walk and chew gum ― address supply in the short term because families need to take their kids to school, and go to work, get groceries and go about their lives ― and often that requires gas,” the spokesperson said. “But in the long term we must speed up ― not slow down ― our transition to a clean energy future.”The State Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Along with ordering a massive draw on the nation’s oil reserves last week, Biden called on Congress to require oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases, as well as pass his stalled Build Back Better climate and social spending package.Early in his presidency, Biden said the U.S. would push the world forward on climate action in large part through leading by example. It couldn’t ask other countries to meet goals or take aggressive actions if it wasn’t willing to meet the moment itself. But the consensus among climate experts and advocates appears to be that while the Biden administration is talking the talk, it is not yet walking the walk — that the rhetoric has not translated into the aggressive policies that scientists say are required to, in the words of the United Nations’ most recent climate report, “secure a livable and sustainable future for all.”Even before Russia’s invasion, U.S. climate groups were disappointed in Biden’s ability to deliver at home. Greenpeace USA, a major environmental organization, gave his first year in office a failing grade on its running scorecard of Biden’s climate actions. The Build Back Better plan and its ambitious climate spending were the administration’s chief legislative vehicle to achieve many of its goals. But its future, as a climate plan or as any plan at all, was in doubt even before the invasion inspired Democratic skittishness about the political impact of rising gas prices and GOP calls to expand domestic oil and gas production.Biden has also come under fire from forest experts. Along with advancing several planned logging projects in mature, carbon-rich forests in the Pacific Northwest, the administration in November released a long-term strategy for slashing emissions that appeared to float cutting down old-growth trees and replacing them with younger stands as a solution to climate change and climate-fueled wildfires. Dozens of climate and public land advocacy organizations have since launched a national campaign to pressure Biden to enact rules to conserve remaining mature forests across the federal estate.John Noël, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace USA, said it’s been “disorienting” to watch fossil fuel permitting and production increase under Biden’s watch after the president described climate change an “existential threat.”“The overall mood is pissed, straight up,” Noël said. “It’s totally unacceptable.”Greenpeace USA is among more than 200 climate, social justice and progressive groups that sent Biden a letter last month urging him to “resist short-sighted policies such as scaling up domestic fossil fuel production” and instead to use his executive power, specifically by invoking the Defense Production Act, to speed up America’s transition to clean energy technologies and flight fossil fuel-driven planetary warming. On Thursday, Biden did invoke the Defense Production Act in an effort boost production of critical minerals used in batteries and clean energy technology.Similarly, the 98-member Congressional Progressive Caucus has called on Biden to take several actions that they argue would allow him to deliver on his campaign promises, including declaring a national climate emergency, reinstating a ban on crude oil exports, prohibiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters, and ending fossil fuel subsidies.At some point, the Biden administration has to pick a side, said Oil Change International’s Rees.“This desire to not make anybody mad is going to make everybody mad,” he said. “They need to decide if they are going to be with people or polluters.”Biden and his team seemingly have as much if not more work to do to prove themselves on the international stage.Ahead of last year’s COP26 climate summit, Biden pledged to double U.S. climate aid for developing nations from $5.6 billion to $11.4 billion per year by 2024. It was expected to close the gap on the U.S. and other rich nations’ decade-old broken promise of providing $100 billion in climate finance for low-income and vulnerable countries to develop clean energy and adapt to the mounting impacts of climate change.But when Congress passed its $1.5 trillion spending bill on March 10, less than two weeks after the United Nations’ latest dire climate study, it included a measly $1 billion in international climate aid — less than half of what the White House had requested. (To put that in perspective, the U.S. alone experienced 20 separate billion-dollar climate and weather disasters last year.)“This is devastating to the politics around climate action because there are so many kinds of initiatives and political developments that need those funds,” said Joseph Curtin, director of The Rockefeller Foundation’s power and climate initiative. “It’s a major impediment to progress.”On Monday, the White House released its $5.8 trillion federal budget for 2023. While Biden’s statement announcing the request did not mention climate, the proposal calls for $44.9 billion to tackle the crisis, including $11 billion in international climate aid. But the budget request is just that — a request — and the same congressional obstacles that have plagued Biden and his team from the beginning remain.There is still time for Biden to get things right on climate on the international stage, Curtin said. But with so much attention and resources being directed at the crisis in Eastern Europe, it’s going to require some juggling. In the eight months between now and the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Curtin said it is critical that Biden and his team shore up financial support for initiatives like Net Zero World, which is aimed at providing technical support for countries looking to accelerate a clean energy transition, and South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Partnership, which seeks to speed up South Africa’s shift away from coal. The U.S., the European Union, France, Germany and the United Kingdom committed to invest a combined $8.5 billion toward the South Africa initiative.“I think [climate] is a high priority in the White House,” Curtin said. “But I think it’s taking a little bit of time to crank up the machinery, to deliver on these commitments. Rather than give a very negative grade, I’d prefer to wait and see and assume that the intention is there to deliver on some of these promises.”“Quite honestly, I can’t see any other way of arriving at COP27.”"}, {"title": "Weatherman Interrupts Live Broadcast To Warn His Kids About Tornado", "text": "Reporting the weather was a really personal experience for one Washington, D.C. meteorologist on Thursday.Doug Kammerer of NBC Washington was doing a live broadcast about a tornado warning when he suddenly realized his own home was in harm’s way.Knowing his kids were home alone, Kammerer temporarily switched into dad mode and called home while he was still in the middle of his live broadcast, according to RawStory.“Kent, you there, buddy?” Kammerer said on his cellphone while on air. “Hey man, I want you to get down to the basement. We got a tornado warning. I want to make sure you and Callie get down as soon as you can.”Kammerer also told his kids, “Get in the bedroom down there and wait 10-15 minutes, OK. Do it now.”After the call, Kammerer told his colleagues and viewers he had a good reason to interrupt the live broadcast and call home.“I gotta warn my kids, because I know what my kids are doing right now, they’re probably online gaming. And they’re not seeing this,” he explained.Although Kammerer’s call was unorthodox, he got support from fellow meteorologist James Morrow, who works for at National Weather Service headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland.“The decision to cut in is not easy for stations to do, and for meteorologists to ask permission to do,” Morrow told NPR. “But as a consumer of their feed, and a scientists who understands the risks of strong tornadic storms like this, it was heartening to see this type of coverage for what could’ve turned into a very serious situation.”Kammerer later admitted on Twitter that he found the situation a little nerve-wracking."}, {"title": "21 Of The Funniest Tweets About Dogs And Cats This Week (March 26-April 1)", "text": "Woof — it has, once again, been a long week.We Shih Tzu not."}, {"title": "Underrated National Parks You Should Visit", "text": "The pandemic may have restricted travel over the past two years, but it also opened many Americans’ eyes to the beautiful sights in their own backyards.Indeed, the National Park System reported a record for visitors in 2020 and 2021, with travelers flocking to popular spots like the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Park.But those famous destinations represent only a fraction of the 63 national parks in the U.S. And though you may not have heard of many of them, they are more than worthy of attention.We asked seasoned national park visitors and travel experts to share which of the 63 national parks they think are overlooked. Read on for 15 hidden gems to add to your national park bucket list.“There’s really no doubt in my mind that Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota is the most underrated national park in America,” said Jim Pattiz, co-founder of the organization More Than Just Parks.“Voyageurs really has it all,” he added. “Thousands of acres of pristine lakes and forests that are home to wolves, moose and world-class fishing. The kind of solitude you only get in the remote backcountry of most other parks, and nightly opportunities to see the northern lights in all their glory.”Pattiz recommended visitors spend time on the glassy lake waters and take in the spectacular sunrise and sunset views.“There’s something about gliding along in a canoe through a mosaic of placid water and wooded islands with only the sound of your oar and the calls of distant loons to fill the vast quiet space,” he said. “Voyageurs is the only park my wife and I go back to every year because it provides an outdoor sanctuary that other parks simply can’t seem to replicate.”“While North Cascades National Park is well known to outdoor enthusiasts in the state of Washington, it’s surprisingly underrated to the general public,” said Heather Gyselman, a product manager for adventure travel at REI. “Outside of Alaska, it’s home to more glaciers than anywhere else in the U.S. and set amongst some of the most magnificent mountains and peaks within the Cascade Mountain range.”She noted that the park is part of the North Cascades National Park complex, which also contains Ross Lake National Recreation Area and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.“All offer something special,” Gyselman said. “Whether you’re looking to escape gray skies on sunny Lake Chelan or find inspiration while standing in the midst of snowcapped peaks from Sahale Arm, there’s something for everyone.”Adventure travel blogger Andy Fine praised the park’s serene wilderness, breathtaking vistas and ease of access from Seattle.“The North Cascades offers an incredible mix of epic mountain views painted with the bluest lakes and spiring mountain peaks crowned by endless glaciers,” he said. “It’s rough around the edges, but when fully immersed in, the park can provide some lifetime worthy experiences.”“There are probably a dozen U.S. national parks that fly below the radar,” said Joe Yogerst, author of “50 States, 500 Campgrounds: Where to Go, When to Go, What to See, What to Do.”“One of my all-time favorites is Capitol Reef in Utah,” he added. ”[It’s] an incredible red-rock wilderness with awesome hiking trails, slot canyons and pioneer history that gets a fraction of the visitors that make summers super crowded at better-known parks in the Southwest, like Arches, Zion and the Grand Canyon.”Capitol Reef, in Utah’s south-central desert, includes popular sites such as Chimney Rock pillar, Hickman Bridge arch and the white sandstone formation known as Capitol Dome.“When folks travel to the Southwest, they often think of the Grand Canyon in Arizona or Zion in Utah, but another very overlooked park that should be added to your list is Saguaro National Park, just outside of Tucson,” said Will Pattiz, the other co-founder of More Than Just Parks.The park’s name pays homage to the iconic saguaro cactus, which visitors can admire throughout its desert grounds. The visual effect is pure American Southwest.“The sunsets at Saguaro National Park are perhaps the most spectacular of any you’ll find in the southwestern United States,” he added. “The Tucson valley creates especially long-lasting sunsets, with stunning purple and golden hues.”Kurt Repanshek, founder of National Parks Traveler, thinks Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota is one of the most underrated national parks. He noted that the landscape remains largely unchanged from when its namesake first explored the area.“The rutted and tortuous badlands, mottled grayish white, bluff and blue, present a maze,” he said. “And yet the river bottoms are alive with cottonwoods, shrubs and grasses that attract a range of wildlife. Most imposing are ponderous and powerful bison that demand respect and a wide berth.”Repanshek recommended exploring Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site and Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site nearby as well.“Another overlooked park is Dry Tortugas, a subtropical archipelago located at the very western end of the Florida Keys that you can only reach by ferry or seaplane,” Yogerst said. “You can explore a Civil War fort, scuba or snorkel coral reefs, and camp on the beach.”Indeed, this 100-square-mile park consists of mostly open water with a smattering of small islands, but visitors rave about the opportunities for marine exploration and the tour of historic Fort Jefferson on Garden Key.“Big Bend in West Texas is another special park that not a lot of people visit, probably because it’s not near any large cities and far off the interstates that people drive across the country,” Yogerst said. “For me, the best things about Big Bend is canoe camping through the deep canyons along the Rio Grande and hiking the forested Chisos Basin, an extinct volcano that rises high above the park’s desert terrain.”Gyselman also endorsed Big Bend, hyping its diverse terrain and impressive peaks.“In Big Bend National Park, you can enjoy colorful sunsets over the Chihuahuan Desert, hike through the gorgeous Chisos Mountains or cool off with a paddle down the Rio Grande,” she said. “It’s a park where you can unplug, reset and reflect.”And national parks travel expert Mikah Meyer pointed out that it’s accessible during the winter, unlike many other U.S. national parks.“With its most temperate days between October and March, Big Bend is a great winter escape for those looking for year-round park opportunities,” he said.“Perhaps one of the biggest hidden gem national parks is Denali National Park,” said Kate Brassington, co-founder of The Family Vacation Guide. “It can be a daunting choice due to its vast wilderness, but in reality it appeals to all ages and has something for every aged explorer.”She noted that the Alaska park has family-friendly accommodations, trails and attractions.“I think that Death Valley National Park is one of the most overlooked parks, mainly because the name seems to scare people away,” said Jack Steward, co-host of the “Rock the Park” TV series. “I think most people think that the park is just a massive pile of sand, but in reality it has tall mountains, beautiful canyons, bristle cone pines, which are the oldest trees on earth. It also has ghost towns, historic mining camps, over 900 miles of scenic roads to explore, and plenty of places to camp and hike.”Riley Mahoney, creator of the website The Parks Expert, noted that Death Valley is the largest national park in the Lower 48 and one of the most diverse, so there’s something for everyone to enjoy.“Within its borders, you’ll find the lowest point on the continent, Badwater Basin, at 282 feet below sea level,” she said. “From Dante’s View, a great place to view the sunset, you can see Mt. Whitney in nearby Sequoia National Park, the highest point in the continental U.S. Fans of ‘Star Wars’ will also find it’s as close as they may come to landing on Tatooine.”“There is something particularly beautiful about the underappreciated national parks,” said Martin Jones, CEO and travel expert at ParkSleepFly. “The serenity of the untouched locations provides for a unique experience and the opportunity to truly appreciate the stunning views, away from the hustle and bustle.”He believes that Glacier Bay in Alaska doesn’t always get a lot of attention, given its location, but is absolutely worth the trek from the continental U.S.“Those who have visited this spectacular park are clearly in love with its majestic fjords and glaciers and snow-capped mountains,” he said. “Glacier Bay is a real gem, and there are many different outdoor pursuits you can take part in whilst visiting this national park. Hiking in the mountains and kayaking on the open water are only a couple of the adventurous activities.”“The Everglades showcases spectacular views of wildlife, often engaged in phenomenal acts of natural history,” said Janisse Ray, naturalist and author of “Wild Spectacle: Seeking Wonders in a World Beyond Humans.”She advised visiting this “vast, subtropical wilderness” during the dry season, from November to April, to find wildlife concentrated around ponds and avoid the sweltering heat of summer in South Florida.“This is a place that never fails to surprise and bewitch,” Ray added. “Hiking through sawgrass prairies, hope to see large alligators or a Florida panther ― and kayaking in Ten Thousand Islands, hope for manatees, bottlenose dolphins and even crocodiles. The bird life is especially spectacular.”“Katmai National Park, in southern Alaska, is one of the least visited of all national parks, as it often requires a flight to Anchorage, a short flight to the town of King Salmon and then a boat or float plane to Brooks Camp,” said Derek Wright and Amy Beth Wright, outdoor enthusiasts and creators of Parks and Points.Katmai is best known for its population of coastal brown bears and their annual summer hunt for salmon.“The park service also runs a Fat Bear Week competition, where the public votes on their favorite hibernation-ready bear,” the Wrights explained in an email. “It’s a life-changing experience to get to enjoy this yearly extravaganza in real life!”In addition to bear sightings, visitors can enjoy fishing, hiking and taking a tour of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, the site of the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century.“Some of our highlights were waking super early to keep an eye out for a wolf combing the beach for breakfast in the dawn hours, and watching the sunrise and bright and pastel colors illuminate the sky over Lake Naknek,” the Wrights noted. “There’s no cell service and no public internet connection, so you really do disconnect from the digital world and fully immerse yourself in the park.”“Kings Canyon is often overlooked in comparison to nearby parks like Sequoia and Yosemite,” said travel blogger Renee Hahnel. “Many people don’t realize just how beautiful this park is, with its 14,000-foot mountain peaks, giant trees, lush meadows and deep canyons.”She pointed out that Kings Canyon runs deeper than the Grand Canyon and reaches depths of 8,200 feet in some places.“John Muir described Kings Canyon as a ‘rival to Yosemite,’ and he wasn’t wrong!” Hahnel added.“Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in western Colorado is another hidden gem ― boasting just a 10th of Rocky Mountain National Park’s visitors,” said Dan Austin, founder and director of special projects at Austin Adventures.He touted the jaw-dropping canyon views of cliffs darkened by shadows and recommended going in the morning to snag an unforgettable photo.“Along the seven-mile-long rim drive, there are 12 fantastic overlooks, including an opportunity to see the Painted Wall with its pinkish rock veins in stark contrast to the black rock around them,” Austin said. “Make sure to also go below the rim on the five-mile road where a 16% grade will give you the full sense of how steep the canyon is. There’s a great riverside picnic spot and camping area at the end.”“Located 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, Lake Clark is home to some of the country’s most breathtaking scenery,” Hahnel said. “Visitors are treated to an abundance of mountains, jagged granite spires, impressive glaciers, active volcanoes, thundering waterfalls, the largest lake in the state and a lively coastline.”Like Katmai, Lake Clark is also famous for its large brown bear population and opportunities to view them as they fish for salmon.“Park biologists have counted as many as 219 brown bears within a 54-square-mile area on the coast!” Hahnel said. “Visiting Richard Proenneke’s cabin on Upper Twin Lake is also a must when visiting Lake Clark.”"}, {"title": "Mehmet Oz Goes Full Climate Denial, Says Carbon Dioxide Isn't A Problem", "text": "Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor turned GOP Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, declared Wednesday that carbon dioxide is not a climate problem because it accounts for just a small fraction of the air in Earth’s atmosphere, a longtime talking point of climate change deniers.Oz made the remark during a forum in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he and his Republican rivals were asked how they would address soaring energy prices as U.S. senators. In a combative primary, the political newcomer known for hosting a long-running daytime TV show has taken heat for his past stance against fracking due to health concerns, which his campaign has disavowed.Each of the candidates onstage argued that Pennsylvania, one of the nation’s largest energy-producing states, should tap even more of its resources.“As a scientist, I’ll tell you the Green New Deal is a lie,” said Oz, who is a medical doctor, not a climate scientist. He was referring to what is little more than a loose set of guiding principles to combat global climate change. “It’s not just unfair because we’re sacrificing our energy independence. Actually, we want more than energy independence, we want energy dominance.”Then Oz launched into a talking point that would make even the most fervent climate deniers proud.The “ideology that carbon is bad” is “a lie,” he said. “Carbon dioxide, my friends, is 0.04% of our air. That’s not the problem.”Carbon dioxide is absolutely the problem when it comes to planetary warming. CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity are the main driver of climate change, accounting for more than three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions.Oz’s comment is one climate deniers have been making for years, but it also comes just short of parroting another favorite denialist talking point: that carbon dioxide emissions are “beneficial” to crop production and the lushness of the planet.On the campaign trail, Oz has portrayed himself as a longtime champion of Pennsylvania’s gas industry. He’s posted videos of himself bemoaning Biden’s energy policies while pumping gas and has taken a particular liking to something he said people chanted at a town hall in Pennsylvania earlier this month: “Back off Biden! Give us freedom to frack!”But as HuffPost first reported, Oz’s affinity for hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is new. As a TV celebrity doctor, Oz co-authored multiple articles warning his readers about the potential health and environmental risks associated with the drilling technique, which involves pumping a pressurized mixture of water, sand and chemicals into underground rock formations to release oil and natural gas. The practice is widespread throughout Pennsylvania.At Wednesday’s forum, former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick brought up Oz’s past columns that caution against fracking, which Oz’s campaign claims were actually authored by someone else.“Mehmet, in your particular case, in your shows and in your columns, you’ve argued for more regulation in fracking,” McCormick said. “You’ve made the case that there’s health effects from fracking, and you’ve argued for a moratorium in Pennsylvania, like what’s in New York.”“That’s not true,” Oz interjected. “That’s a lie and you know it’s a lie.”In a 2014 health and wellness Q&A, Oz and Dr. Mike Roizen, then the chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, wrote that it was “a fact” that fracking pumps “toxic chemicals” deep into the ground and advocated for states and municipalities to follow New York’s lead, which at the time had placed a moratorium on fracking pending the outcome of a health study. In a 2015 piece published in right-wing news outlet Newsmax titled, “Surprise! Fracking May Cause Birth Defects,” the two highlighted then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s subsequent decision to permanently ban fracking statewide, writing that the governor had “heard enough.” Oz and Roizen went on to call for legislation that “requires anyone who profits from a fracking site to drink the local water.”Oz and Roizen also authored a column in 2017 highlighting the many ways climate-fueled extreme heat, wildfires, floods and infectious disease outbreaks are harming public health.Oz’s campaign has attempted to distance Oz from his previous medical columns, despite the fact that his name is on them, claiming that many of the views in them belonged entirely to Roizen.“Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen have very different positions on energy policy and fracking,” Brittany Yanick, the campaign’s communications director, told HuffPost earlier this month. “Dr. Roizen took over sole management of the daily column in 2009 and when they disagreed on views, he was supposed to clearly specify he felt a different way than Dr. Oz — these are clear examples that he didn’t do that.”Wednesday’s forum, hosted by the Manufacturer and Business Association in Erie, was the first time that Oz and McCormick, the two front-runners, appeared together at a public event, along with Republicans Jeff Bartos, a real estate developer, and Kathy Barnette, a conservative commentator."}, {"title": "Monkeys Near Florida Airport Becoming Simian Celebrities", "text": "DANIA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — As departing jetliners roared overhead, an aging vervet monkey moped on a mangrove branch one recent afternoon in the woods he inhabits near a South Florida airport, his ego bruised.Mikey, as he is called by his human observers, has long been the laid-back alpha male of a troop of monkeys ruling this tract of land, tucked off a busy runway at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. But this day he lost when challenged by a feisty youngster called Spike. Mikey fled screaming and was now sullenly staring at humans watching him from 15 feet (4 meters) away.“Did you have a bad day?” asks Deborah “Missy” Williams, a Lynn University science professor who has been studying the troop and others nearby since 2014. She is also founder of the Dania Beach Vervet Project, which seeks to preserve this unique colony. “We will leave you alone so you can ponder.”The United States has no native monkeys, but the smallish vervets have roamed Dania Beach since the late 1940s after a dozen brought from West Africa fled a now long-closed breeding facility and roadside zoo. Today, 40 descendants are broken into four troops living within 1,500 acres (600 hectares) around the airport. Florida also has a few colonies of escaped macaques and squirrel monkeys.Florida wildlife officials often kill invasive species to protect native animals. But they tolerate the vervets, if they stay put. The monkeys are local celebrities, their travails detailed by TV and newspapers, and popular visitors with nearby workers, who feed them despite signs saying that’s illegal.“My friends are like, ‘You have monkeys at your job?’” laughed airport parking lot attendant Harlen Caldera as she gave them raisins and nuts. Some ate from her hand, while others snatched what food she scattered.Travelers are often surprised to see the monkeys. They squeal in delight and grab their cellphones, hoping for photos. Vervets are gray and black with a greenish tinge, helping them blend into the trees. Males typically grow to 2 feet (0.6 meters) and 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms); females reach 18 inches (0.5 meters) and 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms). They live about 20 years.Caldera and her coworkers are protective of the monkeys, which have no fear of humans, making sure no one tries to catch or harm them. “You never know what people will do,” she said.The entrance to the 16 acres (6.5 hectares) ruled by Mikey, the matriarch, Snow White, and their troop is at the parking lot’s rear, sealed by a locked fence. The mangrove trees are thick and the trail muddy — except where it’s covered in shallow water.Williams began studying monkeys while doing doctoral work at Florida Atlantic University, and stayed on. As she and her guests waded deeper into the monkeys’ grounds one recent afternoon, the 16-member troop approached. The colony lives on spiders, ants, lizards, seeds and flowers — when not scrounging people food.“They quickly learn to adapt to a human diet — they love sugary things and salty things,” Williams said, noting they tolerate human food remarkably well.In Africa, vervets are eaten by leopards, eagles and snakes. But in Florida the dangers are outside the mangroves — mostly cars and trappers, who sell them as pets.Because of their small population, Williams is concerned inbreeding will harm the monkeys’ health. In Africa, vervet males leave their birth troop when they reach sexual maturity at 5 years and join another. They move again every few years. With only four local troops, there isn’t enough rotation among the males, making the genetic pool small.As monkeys are an invasive species, Florida puts tight restrictions on how Williams’ group can help them. Trapped monkeys can’t be released — they must be euthanized or placed into captivity.As Williams doesn’t believe monkeys should be pets, she doesn’t seek veterinary care for seriously injured and ill monkeys, hoping nature will heal them. But her group is building an enclosure for vervets captured for treatment or because they wandered too far.Ultimately, Williams wants Florida to allow the release of captured vervets. Unlike Burmese pythons, iguanas and other invasive species, she argues, the colony doesn’t harm the environment.“The monkeys’ lives matter regardless if they are nonnative or native,” she said. “All options should be exhausted to avoid euthanasia.” Her models show that without change, the colony will die off within 50 years.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission responded that while the colony can remain, no exception allowing the monkeys’ release after capture can be made because their effects on the ecosystem are “not well understood.”“There is also an inherent risk of injury when handling wildlife. Monkeys can act defensively and may bite or scratch. Mammals, including vervet monkeys, may harbor diseases transmissible to humans including rabies,” the statement said.As darkness neared, the troop moved from the mangroves into the airport parking lot. It’s dinner time and there are seeds to pluck and workers’ treats to get. Some played while others groomed each other. Spike and Mikey again tussled before Williams’ admonition separated them. The aging king and his would-be heir then sat feet apart, eyeing each other warily.Soon sated, the monkeys climbed back into their trees to spend another night in their unexpected realm, paying no heed to the loud metallic birds flying above."}, {"title": "Van Packed With Kangaroos, Wallabies Escapes Shell-Shocked Kharkiv Zoo", "text": "Kangaroos and wallabies whose enclosures were shelled at a Ukrainian zoo are now safe thanks to the efforts of a brave driver whose video has since gone viral.The Feldman Ecopark in Kharkiv posted a video earlier this week showing the confused-looking creatures in the back of a van with straw spread out on the floor. Ukraine’s foreign ministry later shared a clip on Twitter.“Today is a month since the beginning of the war, and we’re continuing the evacuation of the animals,” the driver says in the Facebook video, according to a translation from The Washington Post.While the zoo and ministry each mentioned kangaroos, the video also shows wallabies in the van, Max Pulsinelli, spokesperson for the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told HuffPost. Wallabies are slightly smaller, close cousins of kangaroos.The animals’ enclosures have been “repeatedly shelled” in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, the zoo said in its Facebook post. It also noted that by the time the video was posted, the marsupials had gotten to their destination and were “already safe,” though the post did not specify where they went.Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, has faced heavy shelling throughout the Russian invasion, and the Ecopark has not been spared. In early March, Russian bombs killed two employees of the zoo who were trying to feed the animals, the BBC reported. Numerous animals at the park have also been killed, while others, like deer and moose, have been set free into the forest by zookeepers who felt they had better chances surviving on their own.Many of the zoo’s surviving animals have also already been successfully evacuated, including great apes, monkeys, turtles, birds, alpacas and a lion, according to NPR.Many workers at zoos across Ukraine have chosen not to evacuate themselves to remain and care for their animal charges, who are often stressed and terrified from the sounds of shelling. Evacuating zoo animals can pose major challenges due to the size of some animals and the highly specific needs that different species have, and the logistics become even harder during a war, when normal routes become inaccessible and usually routine supplies are hard to get. Last week, a lion and wolf were evacuated from a zoo in southeast Ukraine, and had to be driven in the back of a van with no tranquilizers ― a dangerous situation for both the animals and the drivers.Animals remaining in zoos are at risk not only from bombs, but from running out of food due to a combination of shortages and their regular visitor revenue becoming nonexistent. At least one zoo has asked people around the world to help feed its animals by buying tickets online, even though a real-life visit is clearly off the table."}, {"title": "This Texas City’s Water Crisis Is Shaping A Democratic Congressional Primary", "text": "Days before Texas’ Democratic primary elections on March 1, congressional candidate Jessica Cisneros was shuttling back and forth to a friend’s house to shower and draw water for cooking.An estimated 125,000 Laredo residents had to boil their tap water for 13 days after the city’s main water line ruptured in late February. Cisneros and her family were part of a smaller subset of residents whose water was shut off completely for five days.Laredo has issued a water boil notice six times since September 2019 for some or all residents because the local government was unable to guarantee the water’s safety.The final pre-election disruption added a layer of inconvenience to Cisneros’ packed campaign schedule.But it also reinforced her reasons for challenging nine-term U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar for the Democratic nomination in Texas’ 28th Congressional District.“He’s had 17, 18 years to show the improvements in the community that he’s been able to accomplish in his tenure,” Cisneros told HuffPost. “But we don’t even have water here.”Coverage of Cisneros’ two runs against the more conservative Cuellar — he defeated her by less than four percentage points in 2020 — has understandably focused on the two Democrats’ major ideological and policy differences.But HuffPost’s conversations with voters in Texas’ 28th suggest that their opinions of Cuellar’s tenure and their relative appetite for change were more important indicators of their candidate preference than ideology.Now, as Cisneros prepares to face Cuellar in a May 24 runoff — neither candidate obtained an outright majority on March 1 — she is making the lack of consistent drinking water in Laredo, both candidates’ hometown, a central part of her argument that the district needs new representation.Although the federal government is obviously not responsible for Laredo’s water infrastructure, a core component of Cuellar’s pitch to voters is that his seat on the House Appropriations Committee has brought the struggling district a steady flow of much-needed federal dollars, she noted.“Where’s that money going to?” Cisneros asked. “Because half of the city of Laredo didn’t have running water” as voters were casting ballots in Cuellar’s reelection race.Cisneros has also seized on comments that Cuellar made that appeared to downplay his influence over local policymaking. Earlier this month, Cuellar told the Laredo Morning Times that while he would like to secure the city more federal funds to update the city’s water infrastructure, his influence over the local government is limited.“That’s a local issue,” Cuellar said. “City Council should have done the replacement for many years, they just never did.”To Cisneros, that answer doesn’t cut it.“Being a congressperson isn’t just about what you vote on,” Cisneros said. “It’s about being a leader and making sure that you’re generating pressure, bringing attention to issues, and making the effort to talk to voters directly about what their needs are and what the person in office can do to make sure those needs are met.”Asked by HuffPost to respond to Cisneros’ criticisms, Cuellar’s office provided a lengthy statement from Cuellar documenting both the federal funding he has acquired for Laredo’s water infrastructure and his efforts to coordinate with the local government.In the statement, Cuellar touted his work securing the appropriation of $35 million for the renovation of Laredo’s Jefferson Water Treatment Plant in 2013 and claimed credit for helping ensure that the government of Laredo received $95 million from President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan relief bill. He also said he voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill that provided the state of Texas with $30 billion in funding, from which Laredo could benefit.In addition, Cuellar pointed out that he has been in frequent contact with the head of San Antonio’s water authority, who has been advising Laredo on restoring clean water during the recent boil notices. Cuellar also said that he and his team have spoken often to Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz (D), city council members and their staffs about opportunities to apply for federal funding that might help the city update its water system.“Congressman Cuellar not only has secured hundreds of millions of dollars to address the Laredo water issue, but has worked with the City directly to apply for eligible funding,” Cuellar said in a statement. “Congressman Cuellar will continue to be in constant contact with the Mayor and the City to work hand in hand to solve this local issue.”Cisneros has also sought to connect Laredo’s water struggles to Cuellar’s record of siding with the fossil-fuel industry against clean water regulation. In February 2017, mere days after then-President Donald Trump took office, Cuellar was one of just four House Democrats to vote in favor of overturning a federal rule aimed at protecting streams from coal mining waste.While the rule likely would have made some forms of coal mining not economically viable, the rule’s defenders pointed to research showing it would also reduce the presence of contaminants in some regions’ sources of drinking water. Amy Travieso, a former Cuellar deputy chief of staff-turned-U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyist, lobbied for passage of the law overturning the rule.Asked why Cuellar’s support for a bill that only affected coal-mining regions was relevant to his record in Texas’ 28th, Cisneros told HuffPost it spoke to his callous approach to clean drinking water overall.“If he’s willing to sell out the basic needs of those communities — drinkable, safe water — what would he do for this area as well?” she said.The Cuellar campaign did not respond to a request for a response to Cisneros’ criticism of the 2017 vote.As with any complicated infrastructure issue, there is no single explanation for Laredo’s water troubles.On the one hand, the city’s water challenges appear to stem from a lack of resources. The water line that ruptured in February is more than 50 years old. Replacing the central water pipes and tanks in just the city’s core areas would cost $500 million, according to Saenz, Laredo’s mayor.But several previous water boil notices were due to a lack of adequate chlorination of the water supply rather than a break in the water pipe.Some Laredoans, including a group of frustrated residents who have formed the grassroots group AGUAS — an acronym that spells out “waters” in Spanish and translates to “Action of People United for Safe Water” — blame local mismanagement and corruption as well.They accuse the city government of failing to treat the problem with sufficient urgency in part because it disproportionately affects Laredo’s less-prosperous south side and the unincorporated “colonia” communities east of the city that lack representation on the city council.AGUAS has asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, to penalize the city government for failing to notify residents about the low chlorine levels within 24 hours of the state agency confirming that a water boil notice was necessary in September 2019.“Our one-dollar bill — it has the same value in the barrios as it has in other areas of Laredo, which are much wealthier and are better developed,” said Carlos Blanco, an AGUAS activist who has stopped drinking tap water altogether.Blanco would not say whether he prefers Cuellar or Cisneros.But Cuellar’s detractors believe that the congressman, who is also a former Texas state representative and Texas secretary of state, could use his considerable influence to facilitate greater changes in local governance.Not just an ordinary federal lawmaker, Cuellar’s roots in Laredo run so deep that he is sometimes called the “King of Laredo.” His brother Martin is the longtime sheriff of Webb County, where Laredo is located, and his sister Rosie served as county tax assessor.The Cuellar family has “done some good for the community,” said Verennise Arellano, a Laredo school teacher who cited the water issues as part of the reason why she supported Cisneros in both 2020 and 2022. “But it gets to the point where you don’t see any change anymore, where everyone is complacent.”Arellano is not exactly a card-carrying leftist. Despite the availability of more progressive candidates, she voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, and Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.She is instead motivated by a desire for change, even if it means taking a chance on someone without experience in elected office.“We need to have a fresh person,” Arellano said. “Maybe we’re wrong — Jessica might not be the person we’re looking for. But we need the change. We need to see it.”"}, {"title": "Colorado Wildfire Forces The Evacuation Of More Than 19,000 People", "text": "BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Authorities issued an evacuation order for 19,400 people Saturday near a fast-moving Colorado wildfire in rolling hills south of the college town of Boulder, not far from the site of a destructive 2021 blaze that leveled more than 1,000 homes.The wildfire was fueled by wind earlier in the day and had grown to 122 acres (49 hectares) with no containment, Boulder Fire-Rescue spokesperson Marya Washburn said. The Boulder Office of Emergency Management said an overnight shelter was opened after evacuation orders covered 8,000 homes and 7,000 structures. No structures had been damaged.Winds and temperatures have died down, Washburn said. Officials expect to be dealing with the fire for several days due to heavy fuels, said Boulder Fire-Rescue Wildland Division Chief Brian Oliver.The fire is in an area where a blaze destroyed 1,000 homes last year in unincorporated Boulder County and suburban Superior and Louisville. Superior town officials told residents in an email that there were no immediate concerns for the community.Miller said her neighbors helped her escape along with her husband, Craig, their three adult sons and two dogs, Ginger and Chloe. She said the hardest losses from the blaze were things they didn’t look at much, like baby shoes, family pictures and letters from her grandmother.“I feel exhausted by all of this, and I just feel like enough as far as these fires and disasters,” she said. She pointed to a recent Texas wildfire that left a deputy dead and homes destroyed. “ ... So I’m standing there and it’s just kind of a repeat.”Saturday’s fire started around 2 p.m. and burned protected wildland near the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder police said.

He told the news outlet that since he lived near the bypass, “we’ve had 25 deer jump to their death in a populated area.”The deer leaping off the bypass all appear to be female, fellow resident Julie Padasak told WJAC, calling the situation “disturbing.”The sad episodes have been “periodic” over the course of several years, Boylan told The Philadelphia Inquirer, but he fears that the sad situation could be dangerous for humans as well. A white-tailed doe typically weighs  between 80 and 160 pounds. The distance from the top of the bypass is about 60 feet, Boylan told the Inquirer.Boylan said he’s been complaining to the the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for years and wants it to do something to prevent the deer from going onto the bypass. PennDOT told WJAC it’s “taking a look” at the situation and hopes to have more information about the root cause of the problem “over the next couple of weeks.”Deer have been known to jump to their deaths on other human-built structures in the past. In 2005, five deer climbed on top of a five-story parking garage in West Virginia and leapt off.“They took the plunge,” police Cpl. Steve Cox told The Associated Press at the time. “It was just absolutely weird.”In 2017, a couple driving in Cedar Rapids, Iowa were horrified to witness a group of four “panicked” deer all vault over a bridge’s barrier, falling 20 to 30 feet to their deaths.And in 2019, Oklahoma game warden Carlos Gomez, who had to remove the bodies of two deer beneath an overpass, told Tulsa World that deer becoming confused by human structures and leaping to their death likely “happens more than we know.”"}, {"title": "Iditarod Mushers Punished For Giving Sled Dogs Shelter From Snowstorm", "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A fierce winter storm in the last stretch of this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog, which ultimately forced six mushers to scratch the same day, now has cost three other mushers for sheltering their dogs instead of leaving them outside in the harsh conditions.Mille Porsild of Denmark, Michelle Phillips of Canada and Riley Dyche of Fairbanks were penalized for taking dogs inside shelter cabins to ride out the storm with winds so strong, they whipped up white-out conditions, the Anchorage Daily News reported Friday.The decision to punish the mushers was made by race marshal Mark Nordman, who said the indoor rest for the dogs amounted to a competitive advantage over teams that trailed them into Nome.“No doubt that Michelle and Mille did the right thing for their dogs,” Nordman said. “But it also affected the competition for racers going forward.”Porsild was dropped from 14th to 17th position, while Phillips dropped one notch to 18th. Dyche wasn’t demoted in the standings, but he was fined $1,000 after officials determined there were no other mushers close to him that would have been affected by the dogs resting inside.The drop in finishing position equated to $3,450 less for Porsild and $1,000 less for Phillips.The nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska was won March 15 by Brent Sass, who was also affected by the storm just as he was nearing the finish line in Nome. He said he fell off the sled and couldn’t see anything, and thought he was going to have to hunker down with his dogs and ride out the storm.The demotion of the three mushers, which was not widely publicized by the Iditarod, immediately drew a harsh retort from the race’s biggest critic, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.“Nothing makes it clearer that this death race must end than the fact that the Iditarod slapped mushers with a fine as punishment for acting to prevent dogs’ deaths,” PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman said in a statement Friday.She called for cruelty charges to be filed against mushers who did leave their dogs outside while they went inside shelter cabins, “Cruelty is baked into this deadly race, and it’s time for it to stop.”Porsild defended her decision bring the dogs inside.“Stopping and having the dogs in the shelter cabin gave Michelle and I no competition edge; on the contrary we both lost the edge we had — especially me and my team,” she wrote to the Daily News from Denmark.Iditarod rules say dogs cannot be taken inside shelters except for race veterinarians’ medical examination or treatment. However, the entry immediately after that one in the Iditarod rule book says: “There will be no cruel or inhumane treatment of dogs. Cruel or inhumane treatment involves any action or inaction, which causes preventable pain or suffering to a dog.”Four mushers — Matt Hall, three-time champion Mitch Seavey, Lev Shvarts and former champion Joar Leifseth Ulsom — filed complaints against Porsild and Phillips. Hall and Seavey were each moved up a spot when Porsild and Phillips were demoted, and Shvarts moved up two spots.“There was no doubt to me that my dogs sitting unprotected in these conditions could lead to death or deaths of dog(s),” Porsild wrote in an email to Nordman after the race, explaining why she did it.“With no natural wind breaks or materials available to shelter them I made what I felt was the best choice for my dog’s welfare in that extreme situation,” Phillips wrote on Facebook.Separately, Dyche also took his team inside a different shelter cabin to avoid the storm and was fined for not informing race officials he did so.Dyche told the newspaper that he knew it was a violation to bring the dogs inside, but he had no choice after failing to improvise a windbreak for them. He said as he sat in the cabin with the dogs for the next 24 hours and heard the winds hammer the cabin, he knew he made the right decision.Porsild, who returned to Norway after the race, was not informed by race officials of the demotion. She found out only when Phillips told her days later.Phillips announced on Facebook that this was her last Iditarod."}, {"title": "Scientists Figure Out How Vampire Bats Got A Taste For Blood", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists have figured out why vampire bats are the only mammals that can survive on a diet of just blood.They compared the genome of common vampire bats to 26 other bat species and identified 13 genes that are missing or no longer work in vampire bats. Over the years, those gene tweaks helped them adapt to a blood diet rich in iron and protein but with minimal fats or carbohydrates, the researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances.The bats live in South and Central America and are basically “living Draculas,” said co-author Michael Hiller of Germany’s Max Planck Institute. About 3 inches (8 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 7 inches (18 centimeters), the bats bite and than lap up blood from livestock or other animals at night.Most mammals couldn’t survive on a low-calorie liquid diet of blood. Only three vampire species of the 1,400 kinds of bats can do that — the others eat mostly insects, fruit, nectar, pollen or meat, such as small frogs and fish.“Blood is a terrible food source,” said Hannah Kim Frank, a bat researcher at Tulane University, who was not involved in the study. “It’s totally bizarre and amazing that vampire bats can survive on blood — they are really weird, even among bats.”Some other creatures also have a taste for blood, including mosquitoes, bedbugs, leeches and fleas.The latest work expands upon research by another team that pinpointed three of the 13 gene losses.“The new paper shows how different vampire bats are from even other closely related bats, which eat nectar and fruit,” said Kate Langwig, a bat researcher at Virginia Tech, who had no role in the study.With such a low-calorie diet, vampire bats can’t go long without a meal. In a pinch, well-fed ones will regurgitate their food to share with a starving neighbor. They seem to keep track of who has helped them in the past, said Hiller, noting that vampire bats have complex social relationships.“It’s not a kin thing,” said Tulane’s Frank. “They just notice and remember: You’re a good sharer, I will reward you.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

It happened at the beginning of a freakish warm spell last week when temperatures soared more than 70 degrees (40 Celsius) warmer than normal in some spots of East Antarctica. Satellite photos show the area had been shrinking rapidly the last couple of years, and now scientists say they wonder if they have been overestimating East Antarctica’s stability and resistance to global warming that has been melting ice rapidly on the smaller western side and the vulnerable peninsula.The ice shelf, about 460 square miles wide (1200 square kilometers) holding in the Conger and Glenzer glaciers from the warmer water, collapsed between March 14 and 16, said ice scientist Catherine Walker of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. She said scientists have never seen this happen in this part of the continent and that makes it worrisome.“The Glenzer Conger ice shelf presumably had been there for thousands of years and it’s not ever going to be there again,” said University of Minnesota ice scientist Peter Neff.The issue isn’t the amount of ice lost in this collapse, Neff and Walker said. It’s negligible. But it’s more about the where it happened.Neff said he worries that previous assumptions about East Antarctica’s stability may not be so right. And that’s important because the water frozen in East Antarctica if it melted — and that’s a millennia-long process if not longer — would raise seas across the globe more than 160 feet (50 meters). It’s more than five times the ice in the more vulnerable West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where scientists have concentrated much of their research.Scientists had been seeing the ice shelf shrink a bit since the 1970s, Neff said. Then in 2020, the shelf’s ice loss sped up to losing about half of itself every month or so, Walker said.“We probably are seeing the result of a lot of long time increased ocean warming there,” Walker said. “it’s just been melting and melting.”And then last week’s warming “probably is something like, you know, the last straw on the camel’s back.”Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

It’s slated to be completed by early 2025.The $90 million price tag will be covered by about 60% private donations, with the rest coming from public funds set aside for conservation purposes. The span will be named the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, for the philanthropist whose foundation donated $25 million.Gov. Gavin Newsom called the project an “inspiring example” of public-private partnership.“California’s diverse array of native species and ecosystems have earned the state recognition as a global biodiversity hotspot. In the face of extreme climate impacts, it’s more important than ever that we work together to protect our rich natural heritage,” Newsom said in a statement Thursday.The star of the fundraising campaign was the mountain lion P-22. Famous for traveling across two freeways and making a huge Los Angeles park his home, the big cat became a symbol of the shrinking genetic diversity of wild animals that must remain all but trapped by sprawling development or risk becoming roadkill.Scientists tracking cougars fitted with GPS collars found over decades that roadways are largely confining animals in mountains that run along the Malibu coast and across the middle of LA to Griffith Park, where P-22 settled.Despite being the face of the project, P-22 is unlikely to use the bridge because he’s confined to the park many miles away. But many of his relatives could benefit, Pratt said.Some 300,000 cars a day travel that stretch of the 101 in Agoura Hills, a small city surrounded by a patchwork of protected wildland that the new crossing will connect.Drivers in the Liberty Canyon area will speed under the bridge 165 feet (50 meters) wide with brush and trees growing on top, seamlessly joining hillsides on both sides of the lanes.Architects designed the topography to be indistinguishable from the scenery on either side. Berms and hollows with high edges will block sound and light from the lanes below.Wildlife crossings — bridges and tunnels — are common in western Europe and Canada.

But visitors to the Mile High City don’t always know how to get the proper experience ― and many make their fair share of missteps.We asked Denver locals to share some of the faux pas they’ve observed. From packing the wrong outfits to underestimating the effects of the high altitude, here are 16 mistakes tourists often make while visiting Denver ― and some advice for avoiding these errors during your travels.“Don’t stay indoors, opt to go outside. We love our outdoors and you will, too. Hop in on a game of volleyball at Wash Park (Washington Park), or play a round of golf at one of the many courses throughout the city. There is something for everyone. So before you book a museum each day, consider a day outside.” ― Breanna Phippen, blogger at Bites with Bre“Don’t underestimate Denver’s altitude. Denver has an elevation of 5,280 feet, making us closer to the sun. Your body will need time to adjust to the altitude, which will affect working out, hiking and drinking. Make sure to pace yourself, stay extra hydrated, wear sunscreen and know that headaches and nosebleeds can happen while visiting the Mile High City.” ― Jamie Lee, blogger at The Denver Housewife“Book yourself a float tank, IV therapy or both. Your body will thank you. The altitude is no joke and can affect anyone. Sip your adult beverages slowly and don’t expect to hit any personal records in your fitness.” ― Phippen“Going out in the late afternoon without layers is a mistake when traveling in Colorado, particularly in the early spring and late fall. The air feels much warmer than the outside temperature from the sun, so you’ll be comfortable wearing a short sleeve or tank. However, as soon as the sun goes down over the mountains, it instantly feels much colder and you’ll want a jacket.” ― Shelby Elmore, a marketing professional“Denver is known for its uncertain weather. We can often see all four seasons in a day or week. Pack layers for your trip since it can snow until the middle of May, and heavy afternoon downpours and hailstorms are normal during summer afternoons. Wear comfortable shoes, hats, sunscreen and layers because you never know how the weather will change during the day.” ― Lee“Consider your footwear. Ditch the dress shoes or high heels for Birkenstocks and gym shoes. We appreciate the laid-back style, and the majority of bars, restaurants and even clubs require casual for their dress code.” ― Phippen“Share the road. We are a bicycle-friendly community. Road cyclists will always choose the bike lane, but remember they have the right to the full car lane. It’s also easier to get around the city by bike, scooter or foot, so ditch the car rental.” ― Phippen“The biggest mistake I’ve seen tourists make while visiting Denver is often overlooking all of the city’s hidden gems. Of the unique features that make Denver authentically local, guests should explore our small, distinctive neighborhood streets ― each anchored by one of our large, beautiful city parks. Guests can also enjoy hundreds of off-the-beaten-path, chef-driven restaurants, as well as plenty of small bars, breweries and quaint boutiques. Denver is a unique city in that it is both urban yet rural, outdoorsy yet chic, and cultured, yet rustic. It’s a great big city filled with a small-town atmosphere.” ― Tony Dunn, general manager of Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel“Pace yourself and hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! Denver is the Mile High City, so if you are coming from sea level, be kind to your body and dial it back on physical exertion and alcoholic drinking until your body acclimates to the altitude. The city is famous for its outdoor activities and breweries, but if you want to be in a position to actually enjoy all that the city has to offer (rather than feeling sick or winded), please remember to slow it down at least for the first day or two, and be sure to drink lots of water!” ― Laura Young, blogger at New Denizen“You’d be surprised how much more the elevation seems to increase the effects of alcohol. Also, drink a ton of water, especially if you’re drinking, because you’ll feel much more dehydrated.” ― Elmore“Skip Rocky Mountain oysters. No, they are not oysters from the sea. Many tourists can be tricked by the name until they learn what they really just ate: deep-fried bull testicles.” ― Phippen“If you are canni-curious, talk to the budtender before eating the whole edible. As [Colorado is] one of the first states to legalize marijuana, Denver is a great destination for cannabis tourism. However, that goes in hand with our weed being strong. Take it easy when consuming. Our edibles can take a few hours to hit, too. For example, an edible chocolate bar sold as a 100-milligram package is divided into tiny 10-milligram squares. That little square alone is enough to send you to the moon.” ― Phippen“One mistake I see travelers make is that they feel the best restaurants are the ones in the heart of downtown or the ones with the best Yelp review. These can be good, don’t get me wrong. But the best is when you ask people (or strangers) from that city what their hidden gem is and why. It makes the experience more exciting and authentic. This way you aren’t always mystified by location or atmosphere, but you understand who’s living in the city and their contributions to it. This may take you off the normal route, but it’ll take you so much further with that unique memory to take from it.” ― Haley Paez, blogger at Mile High & Hungry“Denver is not the mountains. Those are to the west, and we are situated east of the mountains between the foothills and plains. If you are looking to head to the mountains without trekking to a ski town, plan a visit to Golden, Evergreen or Idaho Springs. All of these towns are within 20 to 40 minutes from the city.” ― Phippen“Don’t pass up the chance to devour breakfast burritos. Denver loves their breakfast burritos so much the mayor declared an annual statewide Breakfast Burrito Day (Oct. 14). We like our burritos served handheld-style, wrapped in a piece of foil and stuffed with green chili.” ― Phippen“Skip the coffee chains and caffeinate at one of the many roasteries like Huckleberry, Thump Coffee or Pablo’s Coffee, to name a few.” ― Phippen“Don’t miss a Broncos-colored sunset from one of the many outdoor patios. Speaking of patios, Denverites love happy hour ― they can start as early as 2 p.m. and stay as late as 7 p.m.” ― Phippen“While there is the free shuttle that runs up and down 16th Street Mall, this is not the best spot to be if you want to vacation like a Denverite. Hop on a scooter to RiNo and take a stroll through the RiNo art alley to find the freshest murals and art come to life. Walk to Larimer Square to shop the boutiques or take an Uber to Cherry Creek North for luxury shopping.” ― Phippen“A mistake I see is people predetermining cities based on expectation or comparing it to others. The beauty of all the cities and subcommunities of the world is their own personality that only they can provide. There’s value in every place, and it makes it more enriching to let the city be in the driver’s seat. A common one for Denver is that the food scene is weak compared to other places. But when you take the time to see who’s here and let them express their passion, you’re bound to be surprised.” ― Paez"}, {"title": "Great Barrier Reef Hit With ‘Grim’ Sixth Mass Bleaching Event", "text": "SYDNEY — Australia’s iconic Great Barrier Reef is undergoing yet another devastating mass coral bleaching event, the fourth since 2016, the country’s marine park authority said Friday.It’s the sixth mass bleaching since 1998 and the first time the reef has been hit by such a disaster during a La Niña year, which typically brings cooler weather. Scientists who had hoped the season would give coral time to recover said the latest mass bleaching was a “grim” sign for the future.Bleaching happens most often when delicate coral polyps are effectively cooked by unusually warm water. Bleached coral, which turns a sickly white, can recover if water temperatures return to normal. But if the warm water lingers for too long, large swaths of reefs can die.“It is important to note that bleached coral is stressed but still alive,” the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in a statement. “If conditions moderate, bleached corals can recover from this stress, as was the case in 2020 when there was very low coral mortality associated with a mass bleaching event.”Still, bleaching has happened again and again on the Great Barrier Reef since 2016, and a study published in November found that just 2% of the structure had escaped bleaching over the previous 30 years. That figure is shocking, as the Great Barrier is the largest living structure on the planet, stretching nearly 1,500 miles and comprising more than 3,000 individual reefs.The Australian government has faced fierce criticism from scientists and environmental groups in recent years over its attempts to protect the reef with injections of cash. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a $700 million package to protect the structure in January, bolstering a $1.4 billion effort called the Reef 2050 plan.At the same time, Australia has largely failed to address the root cause of the reef’s demise: rapidly warming waters linked to climate change. Morrison has embraced the coal and gas industry, vowing to support mining for “decades to come,” and Australia’s emissions strategies are ranked as “highly inefficient” by the group Climate Action Tracker.“I make no apologies for Australia’s standing up for our national interests, whether they be our security interests or economic interests,” Morrison said in November at the United Nations’ climate conference. “We have a balanced plan to achieve net zero by 2050, but we’re not going to make rural and regional Australians pay for that.”A United Nations team is currently in Australia to assess the reef’s status on the UNESCO world heritage list. The Australian government heavily lobbied to delay calls that the reef be listed as “in danger” last year. A meeting on that matter will now take place in June, after a pivotal Australian federal election.Environmental groups said the timing of the bleaching announcement was extraordinary.“The beloved, vibrant colors of the Great Barrier Reef are being replaced by ghostly white corals,” Greenpeace Australia campaigner Martin Zavan said in a statement. “It is vital that the UN mission currently surveying the health of the Reef is able to witness and record this climate damage firsthand, and not just the postcard-perfect locations the Morrison government chooses to showcase.”"}, {"title": "Remarkably Young Cheetah Cubs Hunt Gazelles After A Nudge From Mom", "text": "A mother cheetah encouraged her cubs to attack a pair of newborn gazelles as a hunting lesson in Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Conservation Area ― and the youngsters responded with vigor, tour guide Francis Kijazi told Latest Sightings.

The site could be established via either a presidential proclamation or legislation.The proposed monument would consist of public lands east of Fallon, Nevada, and adjacent to the four tribes’ reservations. It would encompass the Stillwater, Clan Alpine, August and Desatoya mountain ranges, as well as Job Peak, also known as Fox Peak, which is central to the Northern Paiutes’ origin story. The area is already home to several designated wilderness study areas.The proposed area would be the largest U.S. national monument on land, dwarfing Utah’s 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. (The offshore Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument is much larger.)Area tribes, including the Fallon Paiute Shoshone, Walker River Paiute and Yomba Shoshone, have fiercely opposed the Navy’s effort to triple the size of Fallon Naval Air Station’s bombing and training range in the high desert east of Reno. The tribes argue that the planned expansion, currently on hold, would destroy cultural sites and burial grounds, and restrict access for religious ceremonies and other activities.The tribes see their proposal as a compromise that safeguards their sacred landscapes while allowing for the Navy to continue national security activities on the existing range.“While the Tribes value a strong military defense, the Navy acknowledges that they have been harmed by Naval Air Station Fallon operations, including the contamination of the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s Reservation, lack of access, constant flyovers, and the bombing of a sacred medicine rock,” reads a summary of the tribes’ proposal shared with HuffPost. “Protecting these lands is a step toward remedying historical wrongs and reducing the environmental justice implications of forcing tribes to bear the disproportionate burden of national defense training.”Over several days this week, Cathi Tuni-Williams, chair of the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Tribe, and Leanna Hale, the tribe’s director of land and water, and others presented their idea to top officials in the Biden administration, including Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Interior Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau. They also met with members and staff of Nevada’s congressional delegation, including Sen. Jacky Rosen (D) and staff of Rep. Mark Amodei (R). They met with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) earlier this month.Tuni-Williams told HuffPost she grew up fishing, hunting deer and rabbit, and gathering pine nuts in the mountains east of her tribe’s reservation. The area, she said, is a place where Paiute and Shoshone people return for retreat, serenity and prayer.“Our big purpose here is to recognize and honor our heritage and protect what we have left from years of natural resources dwindling, our sacred sites dwindling,” Tuni-Williams said.Protecting the area is about preserving an identity, Hale said.“Without these cultural lands, items and way of life, we cease to be numa,” she said, using an alternative Paiute term for “the people.”The campaign comes as the Biden administration looks to advance its goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030 as a way to combat the dual climate and extinction crises. But national monuments have become a political lightning rod in recent years, and one as sprawling as what the tribes’ are asking for is sure to attract opponents.In 2017, then-President Donald Trump carved more than 2 million acres from a pair of national monuments in Utah — Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears — in what was the largest rollback of federal land protections in U.S. history. But in October, President Joe Biden reversed the Trump-era rollbacks and restored the sites to their original boundaries. Five tribes — the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni and the Ute Indian Tribe — consider the Bears Ears landscape sacred.The Nevada tribes now championing the designation of a Numu Newe National Monument say the proposal not only provides an opportunity for the Biden administration to get closer to its “30x30” conservation target, but to fulfill a joint order that Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack signed in November 2021. Among other things, the order directed federal agencies to “​​make agreements with Indian Tribes to collaborate in the co-stewardship of Federal lands and waters.”While in Congress, Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe of New Mexico and the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history, voiced deep concern about the Navy’s bid to expand its bombing range by more than 600,000 acres.“They’ve lived on the land since time immemorial, their ancestors are buried there,” Haaland told the Reno Gazette Journal in 2020. “The idea this land that is hallowed ground can be used for this type of training, it is really sacrilegious in a way.”The Interior Department declined to comment on the tribes’ national monument effort.During a congressional hearing in July, Rosen questioned Del Toro, then Biden’s nominee for Navy secretary, about the Navy’s request for a major expansion. The senator also expressed disappointment that the military branch hadn’t incorporated stakeholders’ suggested changes into its most recent legislative proposal.“It’s incredibly important to expand that Naval Air Station, as you know, and the range in order to accomplish our national security mission,” Del Toro said. “In doing so, it’s also equally important to respect the tribes that have sacred land there.”Del Toro’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Thursday. Rosen’s office also did not respond. A spokesperson for Cortez Masto confirmed that the senator met with the tribes earlier this month and is currently reviewing the proposal.Tuni-Williams said the tribes want to be good neighbors and to partner with the Navy, federal land managers and all other stakeholders to steward and manage the landscape. So far, the response to their idea for a monument has been positive, she said.“I’m really excited and I’m optimistic that we will be able to fulfill this proposal,” she said."}, {"title": "Cannabis Farmers Not High On Chemically Made THC", "text": "Over the past few years, Jonny Griffis has invested millions of dollars in his legal marijuana farm in northern Michigan, which produces extracts to be used in things like gummy bears and vape oils.But now that farm — like many other licensed grows in states that have legalized marijuana — faces an existential threat: high-inducing cannabis compounds derived not from the heavily regulated and taxed legal marijuana industry, but from a chemical process involving less strictly regulated, cheaply grown hemp.“It’s going to make our farm obsolete,” Griffis, the chief operating officer of True North Collective, testified before Michigan’s Marijuana Regulatory Agency recently. “The $3 million or so that I’ve invested ... is going to be wiped out.”At the center of the issue is THC, marijuana’s main intoxicating component. While marijuana and hemp are the same plant — cannabis — the distinction between the two is a legal one, and comes down to the amount of THC in the plant, specifically the amount of a type of THC called delta-9.Hemp is defined in federal law by its low delta-9 THC content and is traditionally used for food, clothing and industrial applications. “Rope not dope” was long a motto for those who advocated the legalization of hemp.But since Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, authorizing the growing of hemp nationwide in accordance with state or tribal licensing programs, there’s been an unforeseen consequence: People exploiting what they see as a loophole in the law have taken that hemp, extracted a non-intoxicating compound called CBD, and chemically changed it — generally by the addition of solvents and heat — into various types of impairing THC.Unlike the completely artificial, often dangerous drugs known as K2 or Spice and called “synthetic marijuana,” the chemically created THC at issue here consists of molecules found naturally in cannabis, though sometimes in vanishingly small amounts. It’s far cheaper to produce THC chemically from hemp than to extract it from marijuana.Because it is derived from hemp, that THC — often in a form called delta-8 — can wind up in candies, vape oils and other products sold in gas stations, convenience stores and online, even in states where marijuana is illegal. The Food and Drug Administration warned last year that the substances pose a public health risk due to multiple factors, including the way they are marketed and because of potential contamination when manufactured.At least 17 states have banned such products, but they remain available in many, including the pioneering legal marijuana state of Washington, where gas station and vape-shop sales of THC created from hemp offer competition to the heavily taxed, regulated and tested marijuana market.Virginia lawmakers this month approved a bill to strictly limit the amount of THC allowed in hemp-derived products; Gov. Glenn Youngkin has not yet signed it. In Kentucky and Georgia, recent lawsuits have sought to establish that delta-8 products are legal; a Kentucky judge sided with hemp advocates there on Feb. 28, allowing the products to continue to be sold as lawmakers consider a ban.The U.S. Hemp Roundtable, a hemp industry association, has decried the use of hemp-extracted CBD to create intoxicating products, saying it “undermines the integrity of the hemp industry and intent of the 2018 Farm Bill.”Supporters call chemically derived THC economical and environmentally friendly. Hemp can be grown in vast fields outdoors, without expensive lighting systems, and can have a lower carbon footprint than marijuana.Further, processors can make a more consistent product using chemistry to make THC from CBD, they say, and regulators shouldn’t stand in the way of market innovations or pick winners and losers in the industry. They liken it to the synthetically created vanilla or caffeine added to food and drinks.“Most growers don’t like to hear this, because they feel like it’s taking away from their market, but it’s a great product,” said Abe Fleishman, of Northstar Hemp in Oregon. “It provides an opportunity for companies to scale production, for one, and to make a new product that is, in my opinion, cleaner than your regular THC products.”For critics, the safety isn’t proven; the process of making it can leave behind trace amounts of unidentifiable compounds. The method also allows for the manufacture of lesser-known cannabis compounds whose health effects aren’t well understood.Chemically produced THC is unlikely to displace the top-shelf dried cannabis flower preferred by many connoisseurs, but it is so cheap to make that it drastically undercuts marijuana growers who focus on the extract market, and who have spent a lot of time and money adapting to stringent rules for their industry.Griffis said he’s seen the price of delta-9 distillate drop from $50,000 a liter to $6,000 — and falling — as THC made from hemp floods the market.“It’s an issue that almost every state cannabis regulator is thinking about,” said Gillian Schauer, executive director of the Cannabis Regulators Association. “It’s presenting a lot of challenges to protecting public health and consumer safety, and also to protecting existing state cannabis markets.”And, Schauer said, THC chemically made from hemp is only the tip of the iceberg: It can also be made from bioengineered yeast, so regulators will soon find themselves wrestling with that as well.In Michigan, the Marijuana Regulatory Agency is considering rules that would allow processors to convert CBD into THC with written prior approval from the agency, which would require demonstrations of the conversion method and product testing. They would also have to label their product as synthetic — a suggestion that has angered processors who note that the molecules are found in nature.Oregon’s Liquor and Cannabis Commission gave marijuana licensees a six-month grace period to sell off intoxicating THC-from-hemp products they had already acquired before a ban takes effect in July.In California, hemp-derived THC products are not allowed in legal marijuana shops, but regulators are examining the steps necessary to allow them.Colorado and Washington, which in 2012 became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, last year made clear that synthetically derived cannabinoids, including THC, are not allowed in their legal industries.After an uproar from licensed growers who said they were being undercut, Washington’s Liquor and Cannabis board seized more than 1,600 pounds (726 kilograms) of chemically created THC products made by a single licensed marijuana company, Unicorn Brands. The board went on to ban them from the regulated market.For David Postman, the board’s chairman, THC made from hemp represents an industrialization of the cannabis industry that he isn’t sure voters wanted when they passed Washington’s legal marijuana law, which was billed as a harm-reduction measure.“The LCB and the majority of the cannabis industry do not think the legal market should include mind-impairing, lab-created THC,” Postman said. “Allowing synthetically derived THC in the state’s legal cannabis market could devastate the industry.”Vicki Christophersen, a lobbyist for the industry group Washington CannaBusiness Association, argues that the board’s approach is stifling innovation in ways that will make it tough for Washington to compete nationally, should the federal ban on marijuana ever be lifted.“The collaborations that occur between the hemp industry and the adult-use cannabis industry are not only inevitable, but they’re important,” she said. “We need to look at what is going to advance Washington’s industry alongside all the other competitor states that are advancing at a much higher speed than we are.”___Johnson reported from Seattle."}, {"title": "Hospital In Doha, Qatar, Only Treats Falcons", "text": "DOHA, Qatar (AP) — At first glance, the Souq Waqif clinic in the historic center of Doha, the capital of Qatar, could be any other state-of-the-art hospital.Nurses in blue scrubs move briskly through the bright wards, conducting rounds. Radiology and operating rooms whir with the beeps and blinks of monitors. Specialists squint at X-rays and masked doctors make incisions with all the high-tech tools of modern surgery on hand.There’s just one thing: The rooms are filled with falcons.In the tiny, wealthy emirate of Qatar, the desert birds are among the nation’s most pampered residents.Long revered across the Arabian Peninsula for their ferocity and hunting prowess, falcons today serve as sheikhly status symbols recalling a Bedouin past. The bond between falconers and their falcons has been an inspiration since the Paleolithic period, when drawings of the creatures first appeared on cave walls.Although less fashionable now than in the days of yore, the art of falconry is still passed down from one generation to the next in Qatar and other oil-rich sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. With demand growing in recent years, clubs that teach the sport have sprouted up across the region. Falcons compete in an increasing number of races and beauty contests.The finest falcons fetch at least a few thousand dollars and Qataris spare no expense to maintain their good health.“The establishment of the hospital was to support the hobby and heritage of raising falcons ... it’s a pastime that stretches its veins into multiple generations,” Souq Waqif hospital director Dr. Ikdam Al Karkhi recently told The Associated Press. “Keeping them alive and well is an essential duty.”Public hospitals like Souq Waqif offer expert care to sick and wounded hawks, roughly 30,000 a year. The marbled reception area bustles with owners and handlers bringing their birds in for check-ups, medical tests, feather replacements, orthopedic surgeries — and even something akin to mani-pedis.Falcon nail filing is very serious business, as birds transplanted from the desert wild to opulent homes in skyscraper-studded Doha or bred in captivity cannot easily find sharp surfaces on which to trim their talons.The falcon’s hunt may be a long-venerated tradition, but it’s also grisly work. The cornered prey at times puts up a fight, clawing an attacking falcon and hobbling its wings. Each of a falcon’s feathers is vital to its flight, necessitating careful feather replacement after a scuffle.Doctors pull from a bank of shed feathers to find one that perfectly matches the wounded bird’s breed — plumage of the same pattern, length and color.“If these damaged feathers remain, it can cause loss or reduction of the bird’s fitness,” Al Karkhi said. “They must be treated.”Hospital surgeons treat other casualties of the hunt, too. Falcons’ beaks and talons suffer damage from all that swooping and plunging and gobbling.In the clinic waiting room, falcons perch regally on their owners’ gloved wrists. The Qatari men in their flowing white robes treat the prized birds like children, stroking their feathers and misting their beaks with water.“If a person is neglecting their bird, it’s a huge problem,” said Hamad Al Mehshadi, a falcon festival manager taking his raptor for a regular medical checkup. “When one holds onto their bird, it is something else. The love of the bird is extraordinary.”Oil wealth and global business may have transformed Doha into a futuristic capital with a gleaming array of skyscrapers and megaprojects, including giant stadiums soon to host millions of soccer fans for the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup.But Souq Waqif still sees a steady stream of 150 falcons a day — a sign that the echoes of Qatar’s ancient past are not lost.“Even the look that a falcon and its owner share, it’s different than any other look,” Al Karkhi said. Falconers “feel the loyalty of this bird — a fierce warrior in the wild and yet a pet in my hand.”___Follow Lujain Jo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/lujainjo."}, {"title": "8 Casual Walking Shoes That Are Eco-Friendly", "text": "If you think there’s no way you could possibly make a positive impact on the environment with a pair of shoes, think again.

It was then more or less ignored until Christopher Whalen, a paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History, started looking at it under a microscope, The New York Times reported.The fossil turned out to be “an exceptionally well-preserved vampyropod,” Whalen and fellow AMNH paleontologist Neil Landman wrote in their paper. Vampyropods include octopuses and vampire squid (which are not actually squid).Scientists believe that Syllipsimopodi bideni is the oldest known ancestor of such animals.Contemporary octopuses famously have eight arms, as do vampire squid ― though vampire squid additionally have two long filaments that help them feed. The new discovery suggests that both animals evolved from an ancestor that had 10 arms, two of which went away over the course of evolution.“This fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed 10 arms,” Whalen said in a statement from AMNH.But it was largely the ocean creature’s name that’s garnered headlines over the past month. The researchers who described the fossil have emphasized they meant it in a nice way.“It was intended as a compliment,” Whalen told the New Haven Register this week.“We liked the plans he put forward to address climate change and fund science, so it seemed like a nice way to sort of bring attention to those policies,” Whalen said.He added that they had submitted the paper around the time of the Capitol riots in 2021 and “felt like it would be a good time to say something, even in a small way, that was positive about the start of Biden’s presidency rather than negative.”As The Washington Post noted, it’s pretty common for new species to be named after presidents. A moth and a blind, limbless amphibian were both named after Donald Trump. There were at least nine different creatures named after Barack Obama, including two parasites (this was also apparently meant as an honor). One scientist said at the time that he named a newly discovered parasitic flatworm after Obama in part because both the former president and the flatworm were “cool as hell.”"}, {"title": "Louisiana Digging Out After Tornadoes Plow Through Homes", "text": "ARABI, La.

She said emergency medics, some crying, were dodging live wires as they went door-to-door through shattered homes.“A bomb looked like it had gone off,” she said, adding that her cousin’s home and family were OK, but houses all around them were flattened.The National Weather Service said the Arabi damage had been caused by a tornado of at least EF-3 strength, meaning it had winds of 158-206 mph (254-332 km/h), while the Lacombe-area twister was an EF-1, with winds as strong as 90 mph (145 km/h).Television stations broadcast live images as the storm damaged an area about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) long and a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) wide in St. Bernard Parish, where Ochsner Health said eight patients were treated in an emergency department.Collin Arnold, director of homeland security and emergency preparedness in neighboring New Orleans, described “incredible devastation” in Arabi, where he said a state team including fire, EMS and police officers from across Louisiana was doing searches and damage assessments.Louisiana activated 300 National Guard personnel to clear roads and provide support. They joined firefighters and others searching door-to-door to make sure no one had been left behind, said John Rahaim Jr., the parish’s homeland security director.Residents of severely damaged or destroyed homes in Arabi swept up broken glass and tried to salvage their belongings. The community next to the city’s Lower 9th Ward was wrecked by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and hit hard again when Hurricane Ida swept through last year.Stacey Mancuso’s family had just finished repairing the damage from Ida, which ripped off the roof and caused extensive water damage. Huddling in the laundry room with her husband, two children and dogs, they all survived as the tornado blew away part of their new roof.“We’re alive. That’s what I can say at this point,” said Mancuso. Still, the twister was the third time they’ve had major weather damage since Katrina.Entergy reported that about 3,700 of its customers remained without electricity Wednesday. A strong smell of natural gas was in the air, and downed power lines forced emergency workers to walk slowly through the wreckage.Michelle Malasovich was texting relatives from her home in Arabi when “all of a sudden the lights started flickering.” Her husband saw the twister approaching.“It just kept getting louder and louder,” Malasovich said. After it passed, they saw some columns were blown off their porch, and her Jeep’s windows were blown out. Others fared worse: “Our neighbor’s house is in the middle of the street right now.”The couple inside that home emerged from the wreckage seeking help to rescue their daughter, who was on a breathing machine and trapped inside, neighbors and authorities said.“A young girl was on a ventilator, her father was looking for firefighters to come help,” St. Bernard Parish President Guy McInnis said. “And they were already in there taking care of the young lady and she’s doing fine.”Gene Katz said he, his wife and their two children hid in a closet as the tornado pushed their home off its slab and caved in the part where they took shelter.“By the time we closed the door, the roof came off, and that was it,” he said.As the storm front moved eastward, an apparent twister shredded a metal building and shattered windows east of Mobile Bay. The weather service reported more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rainfall in the central Alabama city of Sylacauga overnight. The roofs of several homes were damaged in Toxey, Alabama, where tornado warnings were issued.The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said a dozen counties had damage to homes and two injuries were reported.The vicious weather hit Texas on Monday, with several tornadoes reported along the Interstate 35 corridor. In Elgin, broken trees lined the rural roads and pieces of metal hung from the branches as residents stepped gingerly through the mess.J.D. Harkins, 59, said he saw two tornadoes pass by his Elgin home.“There used to be a barn there,” Harkins said, pointing to an empty plot on his uncle’s property, covered with debris.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said 10 people were injured by storms in the Crockett area, while more than a dozen were reportedly hurt elsewhere. The Grayson County Emergency Management Office said a 73-year-old woman was killed in Sherwood Shores, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) north of Dallas, but provided no details.___Associated Press journalists Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina; Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama; Kimberly Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; Ken Miller in Oklahoma City; Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas; Terry Wallace in Dallas; Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans; and Acacia Coronado in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Girl Survives Tornado That Lifted House Through The Air And Dropped It On Another Street", "text": "ARABI, Louisiana (AP) — The tornado that ripped through a New Orleans suburb lifted one house into the air and dropped it onto the middle of a street with a family inside.Neighbors said the parents of a girl climbed out of the wreckage screaming frantically for help. Their daughter was on a breathing machine, and now was stuck inside.Chuck Heirsch told The Times-Picayune / New Orleans Advocate that he called 911 as he saw his neighbor on Prosperity Street trying to reach his daughter.“They were screaming. His wife was hysterical. They were already traumatized from taking that ‘Wizard of Oz’ ride,” Heirsch said.“All the men in the neighborhood ran to the house. The mother, they brought her to me. I just held her,” Nerissa Ledet told the newspaper. “I tried to console her. I said, ‘You know they’re going to get her out.’”Firefighters quickly arrived and carried her out in a blanket. St. Bernard Parish President Guy McInnis described the rescue, saying she’s in a hospital and “doing fine.”"}, {"title": "View To A Kill: Humans Interrupt Cheetah's Impala Hunt And People Are Mad", "text": "The fascinating spectacle of a cheetah hunting an impala turned infuriating when rule-breaking tourists interfered. (Watch the video below.)In video posted Tuesday by Latest Sightings from South Africa’s Kruger National Park, the quick cat singled out its prey in an impala herd and chased it into a spectator’s BMW, according to the YouTube post.Many people hung out of their parked cars to view the action, violating the park’s rules and apparently spooking the cheetah.The big cat retreated to the bush as the impala lay stunned next to the car, but eventually slinked back to drag the impala away.Some who watched the footage, which was shot by Hardus Lubbe, Petrus de Kock and Thabane Malatji, expressed dismay at the encroachment of visitors.“Extremely unethical from an animal stewardship perspective,” one commenter wrote on YouTube. “Why on earth were so many cars permitted to enter into such a small area of the park?”“Both prey and predators were affected by the congested traffic and human noise,” another complained.Sarah Oxley, the project administrator for Latest Sightings, which posts wildlife videos from Kruger National Park, told HuffPost Wednesday “it is quite sad to see that many visitors breaking the rules.”“Because the sighting happened near Crocodile Bridge a popular entry point into the park, the traffic built up really quickly and that is why there are so many people at the sighting,” Oxley added."}, {"title": "Trump Still Can't Wrap Head Around Climate Change: 'You Have A Thing Called Weather'", "text": "Former President Donald Trump clearly hasn’t been studying up on climate change since his stint in the Oval Office. The observation he offered in a Fox Business interview Monday is that “you have a thing called weather.”Trump pushed his “weather” theory when host Stuart Varney asked him if thought “human activity” — such as the burning of fossil fuels — is responsible for climate change.“In my opinion, you have a thing called weather,” Trump responded. “And you go up and you go down.”He added: “If you look into the 1920s, they were talking about global freezing. OK? In other words, the globe was going to freeze. And then they go global warming, and then they couldn’t use that because the temperatures were actually quite cool, and it’s many different things ... the climate’s always been changing.”(Last week, Trump laughed that a rise in sea levels as the polar ice caps melt just means “more oceanfront property.”)So that’s apparently a no on human activity. Also in the interview, Trump accused President Joe Biden of perpetrating a climate change “hoax” to avoid increasing oil production.There were no claims of “global freezing” in the 1920s, as Trump claims, though some scientists hypothesized, in largely discredited findings, that world temperatures declined from 1945 to 1972. In any case, any natural trend toward another ice age was interrupted by the “massive influence” of the burgeoning burning of fossil fuels, scientists have noted.On other issues, Trump insisted in the Fox Business interview that this year’s midterm elections and the 2024 elections should focus on his lies that the 2020 presidential vote was rigged against him, because that would be “good for me.”Check out Trump’s climate change observations in the video clip up top."}, {"title": "Goal Of Capping Global Warming At 1.5 Degrees Celsius Is 'On Life Support,' UN Chief Warns", "text": "The world’s goal of stopping the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius will soon become unattainable, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a grim warning Monday.“We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe,” Guterres told an audience at the Economist Sustainability Summit in London. “The 1.5-degree goal is on life support. It is in intensive care.”“There is no kind way to put it,” he said.Guterres’ remarks come six years after 196 countries agreed to an international treaty on climate change called the Paris Agreement. In order to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, the nations agreed that they would all commit to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, cutting the world’s output in half by 2030 and reaching a net-zero output by 2050.The most ambitious goal of the treaty was to keep further global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Surpassing that threshold, climate scientists say, would lead to irreversible damage to the planet and humanity with an array of disasters: sea-level rise, flooding, hurricanes, heat waves, drought, wildfires, famine, disease and overall ecosystem destruction.But even with the agreement in place, experts say countries have not acted quickly enough.“The problem is getting worse. If we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5 goodbye. Even 2 degrees may be out of reach,” Guterres said Monday.The secretary-general’s comments mirror the results of a U.N. climate report released last month, showing that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than past U.N. assessments.Global carbon emissions hit a record high in 2019 before dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic as economies around the world went into hibernation in 2020. But emissions bounced back with a vengeance last year.“According to present national commitments, global emissions are set to increase by almost 14% in the 2020s,” Guterres said. “Last year alone, global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by 6% to their highest levels in history. Coal emissions have surged to record highs.”Wealthy countries with big carbon footprints are not taking enough action to move away from fossil fuels, he added. The United States is one of the world’s biggest polluters, but politicization of the issue has made it difficult for President Joe Biden to carry out the necessary steps that his predecessor, Donald Trump, refused to take. Deadlock in Congress has stopped the Biden administration from renewing a $2 trillion package that includes $300 billion in tax credits for wind, solar and nuclear energy.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also throws a wrench into the matter. While experts say cutting off reliance on Russian oil imports may spur countries to invest more in renewable resources, the conflict could also make climate spending less of a priority as countries beef up military spending."}, {"title": "Vicious Alaska Storm Knocks 6 Mushers Out Of Iditarod Dog Sled Race", "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Three additional mushers running at the back of the pack have scratched from this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race after accepting assistance during a massive ground storm.The vicious Friday storm forced six mushers in total to scratch after they sought help in the storm that packed high winds. Two of those mushers needed a rescue off the trial just miles from the end of the nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska.Race marshal Mark Nordman was informed late Friday that Sebastien Dos Santos Borges, a rookie from Chazey-Bons, France, and KattiJo and Jeff Deeter, a married couple from Fairbanks running separate dog teams, accepted help and had scratched, said a Saturday afternoon statement from race officials.Dos Santos Borges and the Deeters all accepted assistance between the checkpoints of White Mountain and Safety, which is just 22 miles (35 kilometers) from the finish line in Nome.A White Mountain search and rescue team on snowmobiles assisted the mushers to a Nome Kennel Club shelter cabin, where they rode out the storm.When conditions improved, Iditarod volunteers were able to assist getting the three and their dog teams to Nome, where the dogs will be checked by veterinarians.All three mushers were in contact with Nordman while they were at the shelter cabin, and reported their teams were in good health.Earlier Friday, two mushers had to be rescued, and a third scratched after receiving assistance back to a checkpoint.Rookie Gerhardt Thiart, a native of South Africa now living in Cheboygan, Michigan, activated his emergency beacon because of the storm and a leg injury. A passerby on a snowmobile happened upon him and took him to White Mountain. He was eventually flown to Nome for evaluation of his injury.Musher Bridgett Watkins of Fairbanks was able to contact family in Nome for help. Independent of that call, her husband Scotty had left Nome with others on snowmobiles to assist mushers in the storm and he located her. She was taken to the clinic in White Mountain for evaluation and eventually flown to Nome, 77 miles (124 kilometers) away.Another musher, rookie Sean Williams of Chugiak, also scratched late Friday after receiving assistance back to White Mountain from someone on a snowmobile.The world’s most famous sled dog race started for 49 mushers March 6 north of Anchorage. The trail took them over two mountain ranges, along the frozen Yukon River and then along the Bering Sea ice on Alaska’s western coast.Since then, 12 mushers have scratched, half of them on Friday.Brent Sass of Eureka won the race Tuesday. He had his own bad weather encounter just a few miles from the finish line in high winds blowing off the Bering Sea. He fell off his sled and lost the trail.He thought he was going to have to hunker down, stopping with his dogs to wait until the weather improved.“I couldn’t see anything,” he said in a post-race interview.“The dogs, the only reason we got out of there is because they trusted me to get them back to the trail. And once we got back to the trail, they just took off a hundred miles an hour again, and we were able to stay on the trail and get in here. It was a lot of work,” he said.There were still four mushers on the trail Saturday evening, making their way from White Mountain to safety."}, {"title": "5.3 Million Chickens Will Be Killed In Iowa Over Bird Flu Outbreak", "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The confirmation of bird flu at another Iowa egg-laying farm will force the killing of more than 5 million chickens, state officials said Friday.It’s the second confirmed case of avian influenza in Buena Vista County, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) northwest of Des Moines, but the latest outbreak is at an operation with 5.3 million chickens. The earlier case was at a farm with about 50,000 turkeys.The latest case confirmed by the state Department of Agriculture means nearly 12.6 million chicken and turkeys in at least eight states have been killed or will be destroyed soon.Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Infected wild birds have been found in at least 24 states, and the virus has been circulating in migrating waterfowl in Europe and Asia for nearly a year.The first Iowa case was identified on March 1 in a backyard flock of 42 ducks and geese in Pottawattamie County in western Iowa. Another egg-laying chicken farm with nearly 916,000 birds was reported with the virus on March 10 in Taylor County in southwest Iowa.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the cases in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.

Greg Abbott said late Friday that at least 50 homes had been destroyed by flames with more possibly to be found. He declared a disaster in the 11 counties hardest hit by wildfires. The Texas A&M Forest Services warned that fires could also affect parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, and Nebraska warned of an extreme fire risk.The Eastland County Sheriff’s Office released more details on the death of Deputy Sgt. Barbara Fenley. In a statement, the office said she was going door to door, getting residents to evacuate their homes Thursday and it was “last heard that she was going to check on an elderly individual.”“With the extreme deteriorating conditions and low visibility from smoke, Sgt. Fenley ran off the roadway and was engulfed in the fire,” the sheriff’s statement said.As of Friday afternoon, the fires had burned about 130 square miles (330 square kilometers), about 70 square miles (185 square kilometers) in the Eastland Complex alone, according to Texas A&M Forest Service. The fires in that complex were only 4% contained late Friday, with fires burning in thick brush and grass fields.About 18,000 people live in Eastland County. About 475 homes were evacuated in the town of Gorman, said Matthew Ford, spokesman for Texas A&M Forest Service.Several months of dry, windy weather have fueled deadly wildfires in Kansas  and Oklahoma, including one a few weeks ago. In remote, western Nebraska ranching country, a large wildfire has been burning for several days. Meteorologists said they were hopeful that rain showers expected early next week across the Plains would reduce the risk.“We’ve been so dry that even an inch of rain would make a difference,” said Robb Lawson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Wichita, Kansas.Smaller fires were burning in other parts of Texas, and Thursday’s low humidity and high winds created an ideal scenario for the blazes to quickly grow out of control.

The two-mile high (3,234 meters) Concordia station was at 10 degrees (-12.2 degrees Celsius),which is about 70 degrees warmer than average, while the even higher Vostok station hit a shade above 0 degrees (-17.7 degrees Celsius), beating its all-time record by about 27 degrees (15 degrees Celsius), according to a tweet from extreme weather record tracker Maximiliano Herrera.The coastal Terra Nova Base was far above freezing at 44.6 degrees (7 degrees Celsius).It caught officials at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, by surprise because they were paying attention to the Arctic where it was 50 degrees warmer than average and areas around the North Pole were nearing or at the melting point, which is really unusual for mid-March, said center ice scientist Walt Meier.“They are opposite seasons. You don’t see the north and the south (poles) both melting at the same time,” Meier told The Associated Press Friday evening. “It’s definitely an unusual occurrence.”“It’s pretty stunning,” Meier added.“Wow. I have never seen anything like this in the Antarctic,” said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who returned recently from an expedition to the continent.“Not a good sign when you see that sort of thing happen,” said University of Wisconsin meteorologist Matthew Lazzara.Lazzara monitors temperatures at East Antarctica’s Dome C-ii and logged 14 degrees (-10 degrees Celsius) Friday, where the normal is -45 degrees (-43 degrees Celsius): “That’s a temperature that you should see in January, not March. January is summer there. That’s dramatic.”Both Lazzara and Meier said what happened in Antarctica is probably just a random weather event and not a sign of climate change. But if it happens again or repeatedly then it might be something to worry about and part of global warming, they said.The Antarctic warm spell was first reported by The Washington Post.The Antarctic continent as a whole on Friday was about 8.6 degrees (4.8 degrees Celsius) warmer than a baseline temperature between 1979 and 2000, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, based on U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration weather models. That 8-degree heating over an already warmed-up average is unusual, think of it as if the entire United States was 8 degrees hotter than normal, Meier said.At the same time, on Friday the Arctic as a whole was 6 degrees (3.3 degrees) warmer than the 1979 to 2000 average.By comparison, the world as a whole was only 1.1 degrees (0.6 degrees Celsius) above the 1979 to 2000 average. Globally the 1979 to 2000 average is about half a degree (.3 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century average.What makes the Antarctic warming really weird is that the southern continent — except for its vulnerable peninsula which is warming quickly and losing ice rapidly — has not been warming much, especially when compared to the rest of the globe, Meier said.Antarctica did set a record for the lowest summer sea ice — records go back to 1979 — with it shrinking to 741,000 square miles (1.9 million square kilometers) in late February, the snow and ice data center reported.What likely happened was “a big atmospheric river” pumped in warm and moist air from the Pacific southward, Meier said.And in the Arctic, which has been warming two to three times faster than the rest of the globe and is considered vulnerable to climate change, warm Atlantic air was coming north off the coast of Greenland."}, {"title": "Biden’s Climate Comeback Pledge", "text": ""}, {"title": "EPA Union Urges Agency To Scrap Trump-Era Plan To Relocate Houston Lab", "text": "Federal workers at the Environmental Protection Agency are fighting to keep a key laboratory in Houston, warning that following through on a Trump-era plan to relocate the facility to rural Oklahoma would force out dedicated staff and harm heavily polluted industrial communities along the Gulf Coast.The American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing federal workers, including more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, sent a letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan on Thursday urging him to reverse course on the Region 6 lab.“The closing of the Lab in Houston — the petrochemical corridor of the world, with its high concentration of chemical plants and refineries — is counterproductive to EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment” and would be “a step backwards in your commitment to serve environmental justice communities in the Gulf Coast area,” AFGE President Everett Kelley writes in the letter.AFGE provided Regan with a petition signed by more than 2,400 people opposing the planned relocation of the lab from Houston to Ada, Oklahoma, approximately 400 miles north.“In an attempt to save money, they are hurting the science,” said a longtime Houston lab employee, who requested anonymity over fear of retaliation. “We have a new administration now and they need to be made aware of these problems, because they’ve inherited this mess. These decisions were made during the last administration in an attempt to shrink the EPA.”The employee added that the situation has tanked morale at the Houston facility and that they anticipate many staffers will opt not to make the move.The Houston lab serves all of Region 6 — Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. It conducts air, water and soil testing at hazardous waste sites and in the wake of environmental disasters, such as hurricanes and oil spills.The relocation, on track to be finalized next year, is part of a series of EPA lab closures and consolidations that the Trump administration advanced beginning in 2017. Notably, former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is from Oklahoma and previously served as the state’s attorney general.So far, the Biden administration has pressed ahead with plans to shutter the Houston facility, maintaining that doing so will cut costs.“As a result of this co-location, EPA expects to save $1.8 million annually in lease and facility expenses and reduce agency lab space by approximately 41,000 square feet,” reads the EPA’s FY 2021 budget justification document.But other EPA lab relocations have been plagued by delays and unanticipated costs, the agency’s internal watchdog concluded in a 2020 report.Nancy Grantham, an EPA spokesperson, told HuffPost that the location change “will not alter the Lab’s service capabilities” and that the agency will retain staff in Houston to handle emergency response, inspections and enforcement.“EPA takes seriously the concerns of its workers and values their input,” she wrote in an email response. “In keeping with this commitment, we work to ensure full transparency into decision-making that affects their working conditions and lives. The agency is following the direction set forth by Congress for more than 10 years to reduce its federal footprint to be more efficient and effective with taxpayer dollars.”“The agency will be fully able to meet our commitment to serving communities in the Gulf Coast area,” she added.The Trump administration did not hide its motivation for relocating federal workers.Relocations are “a wonderful way to sort of streamline government,” former President Donald Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a 2019 Republican gala in South Carolina, referring to the decision to uproot D.C.-based Agriculture Department employees and move them to the Kansas City area. “It’s really, really hard to drain the swamp, but we’re working at it.”The approach worked. When the Trump administration moved the Bureau of Land Management headquarters from Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction, Colorado, for example, it resulted in nearly 300 employees resigning or taking early retirement. The Biden administration has since relocated BLM headquarters back to D.C.In its letter to Regan, AFGE stressed that the Biden administration has an opportunity to “rectify misguided decisions by the Trump Administration … to undercut the mission and day-to-day work of dedicated EPA employees.”“While the Obama Administration studied potential efficiencies from downscaling Federal offices, it was the Trump administration that acted on them in this case, sidelining overarching goals to invest in environmental justice, enforcement, and inspections,” the letter states. “Your administration has a chance for you to undo these harms, and we encourage you to take it.”Read the full letter below:"}, {"title": "Dr. Oz's First-Class Flip-Flop On Fracking", "text": "Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV surgeon better known as Dr. Oz, used to write and tweet about the health benefits of coconut oil, lavender oil, CBD oil, MCT oil, avocado and olive oil.He also appeared to be a strong opponent of fracking, warning his readers in multiple articles about the potential health risks associated with one of the more controversial fossil fuel extracting technologies.Hydraulic fracturing, better known as “fracking,” involves pumping a pressurized mixture of water, sand and chemicals into underground rock formations to release oil and natural gas.In 2014, an Ohio man asked Oz and Dr. Mike Roizen, then the chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, whether it was true that fracking is polluting air and groundwater and threatening public health.Oz and Roizen replied that it was “a fact” that the process pumps “toxic chemicals” deep into the ground.“We wonder how eager the leaders of the natural gas industry would be to drink well water from a farm next to one of their drilling sites,” Oz and Roizen wrote in a health and wellness Q&A, adding that in Pennsylvania, “there are multiple reports of air and water contamination, possibly from hydraulic fracturing sites, causing folks breathing problems, rashes, headaches, nosebleeds, numbness, nausea and vomiting.”But now that Oz is a GOP Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, he is apparently less concerned about fracking’s possible health effects on his potential constituents and more interested in preserving an industry active in the state.“Back off Biden! Give us freedom to frack!” Oz said Wednesday in a rambling TikTok video while pumping gas somewhere in the Keystone State.Oz’s campaign is even denying that he ever voiced any concern about fracking in the first place, claiming that he had no part in any of those earlier columns — even though he is listed as their primary author.That denial calls into question which of Oz’s medical advice columns he actually stands behind and raises questions about his brand as a trusted health professional.Oz has joined the chorus of Republican voices citing Russia’s war in Ukraine to demand President Joe Biden “unleash” American oil and gas production. His Twitter feed is a spitting image of those of many fossil fuel industry-backed GOP lawmakers in recent weeks.Oz’s promotion of fracking stands in stark contrast to the position he apparently held before running for public office.In January 2015, he and Roizen also co-authored a piece in right-wing news outlet Newsmax titled, “Surprise! Fracking May Cause Birth Defects.” In it, they cited a study from the University of Missouri-Columbia that they noted “determined that for 15 million Americans living within one mile of sites for fracking sites … exposure to the chemicals released ‘may be harmful to human health’ and ‘can result in adverse reproductive health and developmental defects.’”The two also called for legislation that “requires anyone who profits from a fracking site to drink the local water.”In a second piece in Newsmax in December 2015, Oz and Roizen slammed the lack of accountability surrounding chemicals used by the fracking industry.“Believe it or not, when chemicals under immense pressure are injected into the ground during hydraulic fracturing, no one is currently held accountable for the amount and/or type of chemicals being used,” they wrote.Oz and Roizen threw their support behind an American Medical Association initiative calling for the disclosure and monitoring of fracking chemicals to better protect human health, and encouraged readers living near fracking wells to “get a good water filter now.”To say Oz’s views on fracking have morphed would be an understatement. He has done a complete 180 on the issue, even though environmental and public health concerns about the practice persist and a recent poll found that the majority of Pennsylvania residents — 55% — oppose fracking and want to see it brought to an end. An Environmental Protection Agency study in 2016 concluded that such fracking activities “can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.”Oz’s campaign, however, claims his past position on fracking wasn’t really his at all. A spokesperson claimed that the views in their shared columns belonged entirely to Roizen, even though Oz’s name appeared in the byline.“Dr. Oz and Dr. Roizen have very different positions on energy policy and fracking,” Brittany Yanick, the campaign’s communications director, told HuffPost. “Dr. Roizen took over sole management of the daily column in 2009 and when they disagreed on views, he was supposed to clearly specify he felt a different way than Dr. Oz — these are clear examples that he didn’t do that.”Yanick provided HuffPost with a letter that Roizen signed eight days before Oz announced his Senate bid. In it, Roizen wrote, “When Dr. Oz shifted his focus to launch his show in 2009, I took over the sole management of his daily column. When controversial topics arose, we were supposed to debate options. If we disagreed on an editorial direction, I would specify that ‘Dr. Roizen’ felt a certain way. We have found several columns where this process was not followed. I write to ensure that our agreement is part of the public record.”The campaign’s argument raises the question of whether there are other medical advice columns published in 2009 or later that Oz also doesn’t stand behind — columns that had no disclaimer and therefore led readers to believe Oz backed them.Roizen did not return a phone call on Thursday.Yanick told HuffPost that Oz “has always supported hydraulic fracturing and a strong domestic energy industry.” The campaign provided HuffPost with 10 different comments Oz has made voicing that support — yet all of them were from 2022. Yanick did not respond when HuffPost asked if there are examples that predate his bid for Senate.Oz is campaigning on a pledge to “fight back against heavy-handed regulations and protect the PA energy industry!” More specifically, he’s going to bat for frackers, arguing that the technology is effective and safe.“Fracking is something I’ve looked at very carefully,” he said on Sean Hannity’s radio show in December 2021. “You can spread all kinds of rumors about fracking, but it works. It seems to be able to do things that otherwise we wouldn’t be able to do and keeping ourselves energy independent.”Oz has even criticized people who’ve raised environmental and human health concerns about the practice — something that the articles attributed to him actually did.In a February interview with The Dom Giordano Program, Oz said Pennsylvanians are “angry” that “corporate elitists” have “aided and abetted by not allowing smart energy policy to thrive, because they’ve had to go along to get along.”“They allowed green energy ideologists to argue that anything having to do with natural gas, for example, is bad for the environment, bad for humanity, and can’t occur,” he said.Oz added that natural gas is the “right” choice scientifically and medically.“As a doctor, and as an outsider, I can say that natural gas is a much faster way for us to keep the planet safe than most of the other ideas, like buying Teslas,” he said.While it is true that the U.S. fracking boom helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing coal-fired electricity, natural gas is not the “clean” fuel the industry claims it is. A 2019 report, for example, concluded that new oil and gas drilling, which relies heavily on hydraulic fracturing, would generate planet-warming pollutants equivalent to 1,000 new coal plants. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas that accounts for one-third of all human-caused planetary warming. And methane leaks are pervasive across the oil and gas sector.Oz’s flip-flop on fracking highlights the Republican Party’s allegiance to a fossil fuel industry that is the primary driver of global climate change. Along with cheerleading for fracking, the GOP candidate has adopted all of his party’s talking points to blame Biden for high gas prices and Russia’s violent invasion of Ukraine.If history is any guide, his rhetoric is all but certain to pay off in the form of industry campaign donations."}, {"title": "California Man Pleads Guilty To Taking 2 Baby Bears From Their Den", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California man who admitted to taking two bear cubs from their den and notified officials after he was unable to care for them pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited species, wildlife officials said.Cody Dylon Setzer, 29, and a co-worker who has not been identified and cooperated with authorities took the month-old bears from their den in a tree that had fallen across a forest road, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said Tuesday.Setzer contacted wildlife officers on March 9, 2019, and told them he had found the baby bears along Highway 263 north of Yreka in Siskiyou County, the department said.But wildlife officers became suspicious of his story after they went out to the site and found no bear tracks or habitat.“Bear cubs are 100% dependent upon the sow and if they had been wondering on their own they wouldn’t have survived,” said Capt. Patrick Foy of the department’s law enforcement division.Setzer’s co-worker at a timber management company confessed to wildlife offices and cooperated with the investigation, Foy said.“The other person literally brought them back to the den site,” he said.The den site was located east of Salt Creek and Interstate 5 in Shasta County, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of where Setzer said he had found them and had been destroyed. Their mother was never located, Foy said.The bear cubs were taken to CDFW’s Wildlife Health Laboratory in Rancho Cordova and later turned over for rehabilitation to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, which said they were the youngest ever brought into its facility.The cubs were returned to their native habitat in Shasta County on April 28, 2020, after growing old enough to survive on their own, the department said.The department published the story Tuesday on its blog about bears to encourage anyone who may witness wildlife poaching to contact authorities.In November, Setzer pleaded guilty in Siskiyou Superior Court to possession of a prohibited species and obstructing a peace officer in the course of his duties.He was ordered to pay $2,290 in fines and fees and complete 200 hours of community service. Setzer was also placed on probation for 12 months with his hunting and fishing privileges suspended for the duration of his probation, and sentenced to 90 days in the county jail, which will be stayed if he successfully completes probation, the department said."}, {"title": "Deep-Sea Octopuses Are Making Shelters Out Of Human Trash", "text": "One man’s trash is an octopus’ treasure.A group of researchers from Italy and Brazil wanted to take a closer at how deep-sea octopuses interact with trash that makes its way to the ocean after being discarded by humans.While the eight-armed creatures have been photographed with litter for years ― doing things like hiding inside bottles or carrying around halves of discarded coconut shells ― there hasn’t been a lot of scientific research about the phenomenon, the scientists wrote in a paper published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin last month.For their own study, the researchers crowdsourced 261 images taken by divers that show ocean floor-dwelling octopuses interacting with trash all over the world. They then used those images to help them determine exactly what octopuses do with human garbage.“The deep-sea records were extremely interesting, because even at great depths these animals are interacting with the litter,” Maira Proietti at the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil, who supervised the research, told The Guardian.The primary way octopuses appeared to use litter was for shelter, like hiding inside a bottle. Glass containers were what they most frequently used, followed by plastic and then metal ones.They also used smaller pieces of trash in other ways, the researchers noted, repurposing objects like “metal and plastic caps/lids, glass and plasticfragments, a metal spoon, and coconut shells as camouflage,” or making use of bigger items like cans, plastic bags and even part of a surfboard to help them hide between rocks.While this ingenuity demonstrates the cephalopods’ intelligence and “extreme ability to adapt,” Proietti stressed that “it is not a good thing to think that the animals may be using litter as shelter because the seashells are gone.”And some of the octopuses’ behavior could be dangerous for them, like using broken glass for shelter. Proietti told the CBC that one octopus was photographed sheltering inside a car battery, which could be giving off harmful chemicals.The researchers acknowledged that their study had some limitations. For example, it appeared that the number of photos of octopuses with trash was increasing over time. But it’s not clear if this was because of more trash in the ocean, or due to digital and underwater photography becoming cheaper and more accessible, meaning that more divers would be taking photos.But they see their analysis as a jumping-off point for more research to be done on the subject.“It is possible that the negative impacts of litter on octopuses is underestimated due to the lack of available data, and we therefore emphasize that the problem must be more thoroughly assessed,” they wrote in the paper."}, {"title": "Endangered Rhino Born In Czech Zoo, Named Kyiv", "text": "PRAGUE (AP) — A Czech zoo has welcomed a critically endangered eastern black rhinoceros baby that has taken the name of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv in honor of that country’s resistance to invading Russian forces.The rhino was born early on March 4 in the Dvur Kralove zoo, a rare occurrence for the facility even if it has the most rhinos belonging to the subspecies.“The name is another expression of our support for the Ukrainian heroes,“ zoo Director Premysl Rabas said.Kyiv’s mother Eva has been taking care of him in a best possible way, the zoo said, with the baby gaining 1 kilogram (2.20 pounds) a day.

Though water scarcity is hardly new in the region, hydropower concerns at Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona reflect that a future western states assumed was years away is approaching — and fast.“We clearly weren’t sufficiently prepared for the need to move this quickly,” said John Fleck, director of the University of New Mexico’s Water Resources Program.Federal officials are confident water levels will rise in the coming months once snow melts in the Rockies. But they warn that more may need to be done to ensure Glen Canyon Dam can keep producing hydropower in the years ahead.“Spring runoff will resolve the deficit in the short term,” said Wayne Pullan, regional director for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water and power in more than a dozen states. “However, our work is not done.”Though both Lake Powell and its downstream counterpart,  Lake Mead, are dropping faster than expected, much of the region’s focus has been on how to deal with water scarcity in Arizona, Nevada and California, not electricity supply.For Glen Canyon Dam, the new level is 35 feet (11 meters) above what’s considered “minimum power pool” — the level at which its turbines would stop producing hydroelectric power.If Lake Powell drops even more, it could soon hit “deadpool” — the point at which water likely would fail to flow through the dam and onto Lake Mead. Arizona, Nevada, California, and Mexico already are taking a combination of mandatory and voluntary cuts tied to Lake Mead’s levels.About 5 million customers in seven states — Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — buy power generated at Glen Canyon Dam.The government provides it at a cheaper rate than energy sold on the wholesale market, which can be wind, solar, coal or natural gas.For the cities, rural electric cooperatives and tribes that rely on its hydropower, less water flowing through Glen Canyon Dam can therefore increase total energy costs. Customers bear the brunt.The situation worries the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, one of the 50 tribal suppliers that rely on the dam for hydropower. It plans to spend $4.5 million on an alternative energy supply this year.“It’s a very sensitive issue for all of us right now,” said Walter Haase, the tribal utility’s general manager.Bureau of Reclamation officials last summer took an unprecedented step and diverted water from reservoirs in Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado in what they called “emergency releases” to replenish Lake Powell. In January, the agency also held back water scheduled to be released through the dam to prevent it from dipping even lower.Anxieties stretch beyond hydropower. Last summer, tourism and boating were hobbled by falling lake levels. The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is taking advantage of the low levels at Lake Powell to extend boat ramps. Most are now closed or come with warnings to launch at your own risk.In Page, Arizona, which benefits from recreation at Lake Powell, officials launched a campaign this month to highlight that lower levels aren’t necessarily bad for visitors, noting receding shorelines have revealed sunken boats, canyons and other geographic wonders.“There’s tremendous amounts of history out there,” City Councilman Richard Leightner said. “You can see some of the old dwellings, and parts of the Old Spanish Trail are accessible now. It’s an opportunity, but it just depends on the person’s frame of mind.”The record low also comes after a tough year for hydropower. Last year, as U.S. officials worked to expand renewable energy, drought in the West drove a decline in hydropower generation, making it harder for officials to meet demand. Hydropower accounts for more than one-third of the nation’s utility-scale renewable energy.Nick Williams, the bureau’s Upper Colorado Basin power manager, said many variables, including precipitation and heat, will determine the extent to which Lake Powell rebounds in the coming months.Regardless, hydrology modeling suggests there’s roughly a 1 in 4 chance it won’t be able to produce power by 2024.___Fonseca reported from Flagstaff, Arizona."}, {"title": "Watch An Angry Lion Charge At Scavengers Feasting On His Elephant Carcass", "text": "A hungry lion charged at vultures and hyenas feeding on an elephant carcass in South Africa’s Timbavati Game Reserve recently ― and he had extra motivation to keep the remains for himself.

His remarks on climate change, however, have left some of his fans feeling a bit perplexed.In a teaser clip from the March 10 episode of “The Problem with Jon Stewart,” the host appears to offer a surprising (if qualified) defense of fossil fuel companies.“A hundred of these companies create 70% of our global emissions,” Stewart says in the clip, which clocks in at about seven and a half minutes and can be viewed below. “Wouldn’t it be better to hold our noses, to not villainize them, to understand that no industry is ever going to cut its own throat and take away its profits? How do we bribe them?”Based on the isolated footage, it’s unclear whether the former “Daily Show” host was merely attempting to play devil’s advocate with his suggestions. Later in the clip, he talks about the unlikelihood of fossil fuel companies ever being held to account ― and suggests instead trying to leverage the industry’s desire for profit in a way that would get those companies to join in on the transition to a more sustainable world:Fossil fuel companies have so much power in this country, and they have the power, unfortunately, to destabilize the governments that would do the most to make that transition. And so what I’m saying is, co-opt whatever their greed principle is, to make it so that they own this transition ― or at least part of it ― so that they’re no longer incentivized to oppose it. Because that accountability never happens, because behind closed doors, there’s too much money involved. And so in some ways, we have to bribe them.Still, the clip garnered a blistering response from many viewers on social media. Several people pointed out that Stewart’s guests for the episode included Shell CEO Ben van Beurden, whose talking points went mostly unchallenged.“No, fossil fuel companies need to be taken over and dismantled at gunpoint,” Noah Weston, better known as the rapper and songwriter Soul Khan, tweeted. “They have been genocidally destructive after knowingly lying about the climate crisis for decades ... Fossil fuel extraction is going to be the most murderous enterprise in human history.”“‘The Problem with Jon Stewart’ is the most unintentionally perfect name for the whole program,” filmmaker Jesse Hawken tweeted.Stewart’s show was initially touted as his long-awaited return to television after a seven-year hiatus, but the series has drawn mixed reviews since its premiere last fall.Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall described show as being “stuck in the past,” while NPR’s Eric Deggans wrote that it feels “like a stitched-together pastiche of items from Stewart’s old show and a few other programs he inspired.” At Vox, Constance Grady wrote a consideration of “The Problem” that doubled as an essay on how the brand of liberalism Stewart popularized at “The Daily Show” has aged poorly."}, {"title": "Labs Still No. 1 US Dog Breed But Poodles Are Popping In Popularity", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Labrador retrievers are still tugging hardest on U.S. dog lovers’ heartstrings, but poodles just strutted back into the American Kennel Club’s top five most popular dog breeds for the first time in nearly a quarter-century.The club’s annual popularity rankings came out Tuesday, drawn from more than 800,000 purebred puppies and older pooches that joined the nation’s oldest canine registry last year.With 197 recognized breeds, the list ranges from such familiar furry faces as Labs — No. 1 for an unprecedented 31 straight years — to the newly added Biewer terrier (making a strong debut at #82) and unusual pups like the hairless Xoloitzcuintli (#119).For dog fans, there’s plenty to dig into (like a dachshund, #10) and point out (like a pointer, #120). So we’ve rounded up (like a border collie, #31) some highlights:TOP 10After Labs, the top 10 are: French bulldogs, golden retrievers, German shepherds, poodles, bulldogs, beagles, Rottweilers, German shorthaired pointers and dachshunds.OODLES OF POODLESPoodles reigned as top dog from 1960 to 1982 before falling off somewhat in popularity. But in the new statistics, they reclaimed the fifth spot for the first time since 1997. (The standard, miniature and toy sizes are all counted as one breed.)With their proud stance and elaborate cut in the show ring, “they do have a reputation, in some circles, as just being froufrou,” says longtime poodle owner and sometime breeder Page Hinds-Athan of Roswell, Georgia. “There’s definitely more to them.”Poodles historically were water retrievers, and they remain athletic animals renowned for their smarts, not to mention their allergy-friendly coats. Hinds-Athan’s poodles have made therapy visits in hospitals and compete in obedience. Other poodles work as guide dogs for the blind, hunt or compete in agility or other dog sports.Their intelligence comes with some high expectations, Hinds-Athan says: In training, “if you’re going to fuss at them, you’d better be really right. Because if you’re not really fair with them, they remember it.”AND DOODLES?Poodles also make up part of several popular hybrids, such as Labradoodles, maltipoos and sheepadoodles. The AKC, a governing body for many dog shows, doesn’t currently recognize any of those as breeds. But AKC spokesperson Brandi Hunter says poodle-mix fans have made some inquiries about what recognition would involve.One key requirement is articulating an ideal for the breed, in order to attain some consistency.“The predictability is one of the things that draws people to purebred dogs,” Hunter explains.ON THE RARE SIDEThe rarest breed last year was the Norwegian lundehund, consistently sparse in the U.S. The smallish dogs boast extra toes and unusual flexibility that once helped them climb Norwegian cliffs to hunt puffins nesting in narrow crevices.BREEDS ON THE RISEThe standings often don’t change a lot from year to year, but they do over time. Eight breeds, from the low-lying Pembroke Welsh corgi (#11) to the towering great Dane (#17), have entered the top 25 since the start of the century.Some have made Olympian leaps in popularity. French bulldogs, now #2 and a common sight from TV commercials to cosmopolitan streets, ranked a distant 71st in 2000. The cane corso, which wasn’t recognized until 2010, has since climbed from 51st to 21st.The imposing, mastiff-style cane corso goes back many centuries in rural Italy as a farm guardian that also pulled small carts and hunted wild boar. Its versatility endures, says Anthony Simonski, who has owned or bred corsi (that’s the proper plural) that compete in agility, dock diving and other sports and have appeared in TV shows and music videos.While the dogs are protective, “it’s not about being mean — it’s about understanding its job,” says Simonski, of Acworth, Georgia.Simonski has owned corsi since 1998 and is married to Cane Corso Association of America President Rebecca Simonski. He has mixed feelings about their growing popularity, feeling that it draws questionable breeders.“There’s a side of you going, ‘Oh, my God, the cat’s out of the bag.’ But the real problem is what people are doing with that cat once it’s out of the bag,” he says.DOG BREEDING DEBATEDSome animal-rights advocates say dog breeding itself is a problem. They argue that fanciers focus more on dogs’ appearance than their health and that promoting purebreds ends up fueling puppy mills and stranding other dogs in shelters.The AKC says it and its affiliated breed clubs champion and invest in dog health, including through an AKC-affiliated foundation. The club also maintains that properly done breeding has a purpose: to produce dogs with known traits, from size to sniffing ability, that fit different human needs and lifestyles.New purebred registrations, which are voluntary, have increased by 45% in a decade, the club says."}, {"title": "Trapped Antelope Await Attack By Wild Dogs In A Surprising Cliffhanger", "text": "Wild dogs waited to pounce on cornered antelope atop a high rocky outcrop in South Africa.

Guides Michael Botes and Steff McWilliam shot the footage.Van Rooyen told the channel that the small antelopes’ pointy hooves make them nimble on rocks, while the dogs’ paws were not designed for such climbing.With hooves “about the diameter of a dime, this pint-sized rock hopper can jump onto a landing pad the size of a silver dollar,” the San Diego Zoo wrote of klipspringers. “Its delicate-looking feet are specially adapted for traction on rocky surfaces, with a slight suction-cup effect.”No wonder they didn’t become lunch.The dogs eventually found something else on the menu. They were seen later hunting an impala, according to van Rooyen."}, {"title": "The GOP's Biggest Whoppers About Biden And Fossil Fuels", "text": "Republican lawmakers and right-wing media have responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by waging a misinformation campaign about the Biden administration being “at war with fossil fuels.”The goal, of course, is to leverage the crisis in Eastern Europe to provide more access and regulatory relief to an oil and gas sector that is already very profitable, heavily subsidized, has enormous sway in Washington, and is sitting on unused permits to drill across millions of acres of land and water.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) accused President Joe Biden of leading “a frontal assault on oil and gas.” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) bemoaned Biden’s “backwards, America-last energy policies.” And numerous other industry-backed members of the GOP have spent the days since Russia launched its violent war peddling industry talking points and demanding Biden “unleash” America’s full oil and gas potential.The GOP campaign to blame Biden for both Russia’s war and high gas prices has included misleading statements and outright falsehoods, as well as circulating lists of demands that closely mirror those of the fossil fuel industry. It is being led by some of Washington’s largest beneficiaries of industry campaign donations. And it comes on the heels of the latest dire climate report from the United Nations, which warns that the window for reining in greenhouse gases in order to “secure a livable and sustainable future” is rapidly closing.Let’s break down some of the biggest whoppers:In a post to Twitter this week, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) wrote that rising prices at the pump during Biden’s presidency “is what happens when you destroy America’s energy industry” — part of a broader argument that Biden is waging “war” on domestic fossil fuel companies.For a destroyed industry, Big Oil is doing exceptionally well. Two years after the pandemic tanked oil demand and prices, the nation’s largest producers — ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips — have seen their profits skyrocket alongside energy prices. And while Biden campaigned on a promise to “take on the fossil fuel industry” and end drilling on federal lands and waters, that has not materialized.In fact, to the frustration of climate and environmental advocates, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits during his first year in office than former President Donald Trump did in any of his first three, according to data compiled by the conservation group Center for Western Priorities. It also held the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico last year. A federal judge later vacated those leases, concluding that the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate effects when it held the offshore auction.“The Biden admin is doing next to nothing to practically inhibit near-term oil production,” Casey Merriman, an analyst at the industry research firm Energy Intelligence, wrote on Twitter.None of this is likely to temper Republican rhetoric. Biden’s “agencies have been waging war on domestic production, and we’ve seen domestic production dropping and dropping and dropping,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told Fox News this week.In reality, the U.S. produced more oil and gas during Biden’s first year in office than during Trump’s, and crude oil output is forecast to reach a record high in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.In an interview late last month with right-wing news outlet Newsmax, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine because of Biden’s energy policies, including “ending drilling on federal lands.”Biden did not end federal drilling — far from it.Early in his tenure, Biden paused new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters pending the outcome of a review of the federal leasing program — an action that industry-allied Republicans falsely labeled a “ban” and falsely predicted would devastate the energy sector. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana later struck down Biden’s executive order that froze new leasing.More recently, in February, the Biden administration instituted a second pause on new federal leasing and permitting in response to a second Trump-appointed judge’s ruling that blocked the administration from using a higher calculation for the damages associated with planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.None of this has prevented U.S. companies from moving ahead with drilling under already approved federal permits or on state or private lands. Approximately 75% of domestic oil production and 86% of gas production occurs on state and private lands, according to the Interior Department.As White House press secretary Jen Psaki has pointed out repeatedly in recent weeks, the industry has stockpiled more than 9,000 unused but approved permits to drill onshore. Nearly half of the roughly 25 million federal land acres currently under lease are not currently in production.“I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more,” Psaki told Fox News’ Peter Doocy during a press conference this week.While Republicans revive the “drill, baby, drill” mantra and demand Biden “unleash” American energy, the oil and gas sector and its Wall Street investors have made clear they have little interest in ramping up drilling amid record high prices, as NPR has reported.And even if they did, it would do little if anything to ease gas prices in the short term.The controversial Keystone XL pipeline was a proposed 1,179-mile, $8.5 billion project that would have transported some 830,000 barrels of dirty tar sands oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska. Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL via a climate executive order on his first day in office, effectively killing it. Only 8% of the pipeline was constructed and it never carried oil.Nevertheless, Republicans have attacked Biden with falsehoods about the beleaguered project, at times conflating it with the larger Keystone Pipeline system that’s been in operation since 2010 and which the Keystone XL was supposed to tie into.Biden “shut off the Keystone Pipeline,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) declared in an interview last week. “Get the Keystone Pipeline operating again!” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) demanded at a congressional hearing. “If we had a strong president, he would put the Keystone Pipeline back online,” Gov. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) told Fox News. And at a press conference Tuesday, Sen. Roy Blunt falsely stated that the Keystone XL would have “produced” roughly the same number of barrels that the U.S. currently imports from Russia.Again, the Keystone XL was never operational. And it was never going to “produce” a drop of oil. Rather, it was a proposed extension, or shortcut, to transport Canadian oil to Nebraska, where it would link up with the existing Keystone pipeline and be sent to refineries in Texas and ultimately exported overseas.Asked Wednesday if Biden would reconsider his decision to kill the Keystone XL, Psaki said doing so would not address any of the current petroleum problems in the U.S.“The pipeline is just a delivery mechanism, it is not an oil field,” Psaki said. “It does not provide more supply into the system.”There are many iterations, but the Republican argument is basically that Biden “reversed,” “sabotaged” and “sacrificed” the so-called “energy independence” — some call it “energy dominance” — that the U.S. purportedly achieved under Trump.“​​Trump gave us energy independence. Biden gave us expensive gas,” Jordan recently tweeted.“Biden’s anti-energy policies have caused skyrocketing prices, ended America’s energy independence, and compromised our national security,” House Republicans wrote in a post from their official Twitter account.“Energy independence” can have different meanings. If Republicans are talking about simply producing more energy than we consume, the U.S. remains energy independent today, as Robert Rapier, an energy industry engineer and author, pointed out in a Forbes piece this week. But if they’re talking about a nation free of any imported petroleum products, the U.S. never achieved that under Trump.“Flatly stated, the United States is not oil-independent, and hasn’t been since the early days of oil production,” Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman wrote this week.The U.S. has been the world’s largest producer of oil and gas since 2018. And in 2020, it became a net exporter of oil for the first time. Still, it imports millions of barrels of oil per day, including from Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and, until recently, Russia. Earlier this week, Biden signed an executive order banning Russian petroleum imports — a move that had bipartisan support but that Biden warned would drive gas prices up even higher. (Under Trump’s watch, Russian oil imports increased 39%, as HuffPost reported).As the last few months have highlighted, the U.S. remains at the mercy of a global energy market that sets oil and gas prices at home and abroad — a reality that the Biden administration and environmentalists argue should motivate the nation to transition quickly to renewable energy sources."}, {"title": "California Can Set Tough Vehicle Emissions Rules Again, Biden Administration Says", "text": "The Biden administration on Wednesday restored California’s legal authority to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks in an attempt to better address climate change.The restoration comes after former President Donald Trump withdrew California’s ability to set its own tailpipe emissions standards in 2019, part of a broader effort to eviscerate the nation’s environmental policies.California first received a waiver under the Clean Air Act to create the tougher standards as a way to address its smog problems. The state has also been a leader in electric vehicle adoption.Trump’s decision wasn’t supported by the auto industry. In fact, five major car manufacturers signed a deal with California in 2020 to voluntarily follow the state’s emissions standards even though they weren’t required to by law.On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized California’s “longstanding” efforts to be a leader in addressing pollution from vehicles, and said the agency’s “partnership with states to confront the climate crisis has never been more important.”“With today’s action, we reinstate an approach that for years has helped advance clean technologies and cut air pollution for people not just in California, but for the U.S. as a whole,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.The impact of this change could be monumental.According to The New York Times, California is the most populous state and the world’s fifth-largest economy. California lawmakers’ actions reverberate throughout the auto industry and have been adopted by many other states.Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Wednesday the state would only continue its transition towards zero-emission vehicles. As part of an effort to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035, the state plans to increase electric vehicle requirements by 2030.“The restoration of our state’s Clean Air Act waiver is a major victory for the environment, our economy, and the health of families across the country that comes at a pivotal moment underscoring the need to end our reliance on fossil fuels,” Newsom said in a statement. “California looks forward to partnering with the Biden Administration to make a zero-emission future a reality for all Americans.”President Joe Biden has also worked to hasten the adoption of electric vehicles. He signed an executive order last year to see the U.S. have half of all cars sold be electric, fuel cell or plug-in hybrids by 2030.Fossil fuels from transportation are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the nation, clocking in at 29% of America’s total."}, {"title": "55 Tons Of Lettuce Fed To Florida Manatees In Bid To Save Them From Starvation", "text": "ST.

The problem requires a long-term solution because pollution from agriculture, septic tanks, urban runoff and other sources is killing the seagrass on which the marine mammals rely.Through Feb. 25 this year, about 375 confirmed manatee deaths have been recorded. That compares to 389 during the same period last year; both are far above the 136 deaths reported in 2020 during the first two months.More than 80 rescued manatees are currently being cared for at facilities in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and Ohio, according to Terri Calleson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Some of those are abandoned calves that typically take longer to recover.Florida legislators last year provided $8 million for several seagrass restoration projects that will get off the ground this year, officials said. But it won’t be an immediate solution.“We’re not solving the seagrass issue in a year,” said Tom Reinert of the Florida wildlife commission.There are currently about 7,500 manatees, also known as sea cows, living in Florida waters. They are listed federally as a threatened species, although there are efforts to give them the heightened endangered designation.The approach of warmer weather means manatees will disperse to areas where food is more plentiful, officials said.“It’s warming up, and that’s a good thing for manatees. They’ll be moving on,” Reinert said.Officials say most distressed manatees in Florida are reported by people who spot them and call a state hotline at 888-404-3922."}, {"title": "Oil Workers On Foreign-Flagged Ships Are At The Mercy of Corporations", "text": "This story is a collaboration between Floodlight and HuffPost. It also appeared in The Lens and WWNO in New Orleans. It was supported by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism.As Hurricane Ida zeroed in on Louisiana, Howell McIntyre was trapped nearly 100 miles offshore aboard a 620-foot drillship named the Globetrotter II. The Category 4 storm pummeled the ship with 150 mph winds and waves as tall as oak trees, threatening to capsize it.McIntyre was knocked against a wall, banging his head and knees. Another worker, Michael Brunner, was thrown from his bed and slammed into lockers.“The entire crew believed they were going to die,” reads one lawsuit filed against employers Noble Drilling and Shell Oil on behalf of 10 crew members injured on the ship that day.Out of more than 100 workers aboard when Ida hit, at least 13 are suing for compensation related to traumatic brain and back injuries. They say the companies failed to send a helicopter to evacuate them, even as the storm’s danger became clear.But the workers face a significant legal hurdle: While the Globetrotter II is owned by a U.S. company and was contracted by a British company, it sails under a Liberian flag, which means it’s not subject to many of the labor and environmental regulations American vessels must follow.Flying a foreign flag is just one way companies evade accountability for injuries and deaths that occur while pulling oil and natural gas from the seafloor, an inherently dangerous line of work. Oil and gas extraction workers on land and offshore are about six times more likely than the average U.S. worker to be killed on the job, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2008 to 2017, the most recent data available. Even as the offshore workforce has shrunk 40% in recent years, fatalities have increased.And new data collected by Floodlight and HuffPost finds that offshore deaths in particular are being undercounted. At least 138 offshore oil and gas workers died on the job between 2007 and 2020, according to aggregated public records from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard. However, the BSEE disclosed only 53 fatalities during that time period. That’s in part because the agency has excluded deaths that occur on the way to or from drilling rigs and those from causes like heart attacks, which might be treatable if workers weren’t so far from civilization.Of the offshore fatalities where Floodlight and HuffPost were able to determine the flag of the ship, about 40% occurred on vessels flagged in other countries, including the Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 men.Companies register their ships in other countries that have weaker worker protections and environmental regulations than the U.S., allowing them to save money by avoiding higher standards. But crews on foreign-flagged ships and their families may have a harder time getting compensated under a U.S. law that gives them the right to sue for injuries and death at sea, according to maritime injury lawyers.In the final weeks of the Obama administration, regulators tried to close a loophole that allows American companies to register vessels abroad — and had rare support from business-friendly Louisiana Republicans — but dropped the effort after significant industry pushback. The rule change would have limited the use of foreign-flagged vessels in the U.S. offshore industry.Billboards for maritime injury lawyers line the roads of Lafourche Parish.“We take care of your family while you can’t work,” reads a billboard in Lockport, Louisiana, advertising Blake Jones Law Firm. Every month, roughly 15,000 workers are flown from the parish to offshore oil and gas facilities, according to the Greater Lafourche Port Commission.For many, the opportunity to make good money offshore is still worth the risk.“There’s four choices if you go to school in south Louisiana: move, fish, oil and gas, or crime,” said Jon Mills, a deckhand from southern Louisiana. Mills was on a lift boat last April before it got caught in a storm and capsized off the coast of Louisiana, killing 13 men.“People called to see if I was OK,” he said. “Us boat guys, we’re like a family.”Those aboard the Globetrotter II during Hurricane Ida feared they would have the same fate. Nearby oil platforms were already fully evacuated and other drillships had moved out of the storm’s path, and the window they had to avoid the hurricane was closing. Videos the crew recorded as Ida bore down showed the vessel taking on water. Noble Drilling never gave the ship an order to stop work, and neither Noble nor Shell told the crew to evacuate.As New Orleans meteorologists warned that Ida’s winds were topping 100 mph, the captain, who was not named in reports, made the call to try to navigate away from the storm. But the crew wasn’t finished disconnecting the drillship from the seafloor and struggled to wrench off overtorqued bolts. When the ship moved, pieces of drilling risers broke away and more than a dozen tanks on the deck overturned, spilling 3,700 gallons of lube oil and hydraulic fluid into the Gulf. The vessel suffered $1 million in damage, according to the BSEE incident report. While the whole Globetrotter II crew survived, four injured workers were medevaced to shore to be evaluated after the storm.“You’re at the mercy of the company. They have to evacuate the crew by helicopter,” said Houston-based attorney Kurt Arnold, who filed the suit on behalf of 10 Globetrotter II workers.“They tried to cut it too close.”A Shell spokesperson directed requests for comment to the contractor that was running the operation, Noble Drilling. Craig Muirhead, Noble’s vice president of investor relations, declined to answer questions.While a 1920 U.S. maritime law called the Jones Act mandates that cargo vessels moving between U.S. ports must be U.S.-flagged, U.S. Customs and Border Protection created exceptions to the rule that allow for more widespread use of foreign-flagged vessels in the U.S. offshore oil industry, like the Globetrotter II. The International Transport Workers’ Federation has identified Liberia, where the Globetrotter II drillship was registered, as a “flag of convenience,” meaning shipowners can register their vessels without any connection to the country.The flag of the ship determines the shipowner’s requirements for wastewater, air pollution, safety equipment and how workers are compensated if something goes wrong, said Elizabeth DeSombre, author of “Flagging Standards: Globalization and Environmental, Safety, and Labor Regulations at Sea.”She said foreign-flagged vessels have more lax labor rules and therefore save on costs. “The big oil companies don’t want to be operating in a more expensive regulatory environment,” DeSombre said.Between 2005 and 2021, 51 fatalities in the Gulf of Mexico occurred on vessels flying flags of convenience. Some of the fatal events detailed in Coast Guard documents were never reported by the media.In one November 2018 incident, three workers died and two had to be medevaced off a floating platform named the Ocean Whittington after workers were exposed to deadly levels of carbon monoxide because the vessel didn’t have detectors.The platform was flying the Panama flag.Arnold, the Houston-based lawyer, said he is working with about 60 workers who were left out in the Gulf to ride out storms on offshore vessels in recent years.“This is the most I’ve represented within a year’s time period, which shows the companies aren’t taking the precautions that they should,” Arnold said.In January 2017, the Obama administration proposed throwing out Customs and Border Protection’s exemptions to the Jones Act. In an unusual occurrence in Louisiana, the proposal put even Republican officials at odds with the oil and gas industry. American-flagged ships are required to be built in the U.S. and employ more American workers, which helped the move gain support with the maritime unions.Thirty-one Louisiana state representatives, including Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, signed a letter in support of the rule change, underscoring that it would benefit Louisiana workers. Even Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican and staunch supporter of the oil industry, supported the revision.But Customs and Border Protection faced opposition from Louisiana’s oil and gas industry and the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees drilling in Texas’ Gulf waters. In a public comment to CBP, Bruce Culpepper, Shell’s president at the time, argued that the proposal was politically motivated and shouldn’t have emerged just 48 hours before the end of the Obama administration.Shell and Chevron also submitted comments on the draft rule, arguing there weren’t enough American-made vessels able to drill in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton warned in comments that the proposal would kill jobs and reduce revenue, echoing talking points from the American Petroleum Institute.Four months later — under the new Trump administration — the agency dropped the proposed rulemaking altogether. The White House did not return a request for comment on whether it has plans to close the loophole.Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) recently introduced a bill to improve the oversight of foreign-flagged ships that operate in the offshore industry. The American Offshore Worker Fairness Act, introduced in mid-February, would require offshore energy vessels to provide details about who owns the ships on an annual basis. The bill could address the concerns of maritime injury lawyers who say flags of convenience allow shipowners to remain legally anonymous, making it harder to bring claims against them.But the bill would only address one loophole that oil and gas companies use to try to escape liability when workers are injured or die offshore. Drillships are also frequently run by contracted companies because contractors cannot be held criminally liable for worker deaths. Under another law, oil and gas companies can try to cap the damages they have to pay to injured workers. Those payments are based on the value of the vessel, which drops after damages from accidents or severe weather events.Matthew Shaffer, a Houston-based attorney with Schechter, Shaffer & Harris who has filed three suits on behalf of workers injured on the Globetrotter II, said the entire system is set up against workers.The companies are “always interested in making money, and sometimes that comes at the cost of safety. It’s a fine line that they run,” Shaffer said.Mills, the deckhand from southern Louisiana, said that despite the risks of his job, he tries to see the beauty in his situation, like the uninterrupted views of the night sky from a ship out in the Gulf.“You see stuff people don’t get to see every day,” he said.Offshore workers are at nature’s mercy — for better or worse."}, {"title": "Octopus Ancestors Lived Before Era Of Dinosaurs: Study", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists have found the oldest known ancestor of octopuses – an approximately 330 million-year-old fossil unearthed in Montana.The researchers concluded the ancient creature lived millions of years earlier than previously believed, meaning that octopuses originated before the era of dinosaurs.The 4.7-inch (12-centimeter) fossil has 10 limbs — modern octopuses have eight — each with two rows of suckers. It probably lived in a shallow, tropical ocean bay.“It’s very rare to find soft tissue fossils, except in a few places,” said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study. “This is a very exciting finding. It pushes back the ancestry much farther than previously known.”The specimen was discovered in Montana’s Bear Gulch limestone formation and donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada in 1988.For decades, the fossil sat overlooked in a drawer while scientists studied fossil sharks and other finds from the site. But then paleontologists noticed the 10 tiny limbs encased in limestone.The well-preserved fossil also “shows some evidence of an ink sac,” probably used to squirt out a dark liquid cloak to help to evade predators, just like modern octopuses, said Christopher Whalen, an American Museum of Natural History paleontologist and co-author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.The creature, a vampyropod, was likely the ancestor of both modern octopuses and vampire squid, a confusingly named marine critter that’s much closer to an octopus than a squid. Previously, the “oldest known definitive” vampyropod was from around 240 million years ago, the authors said.The scientists named the fossil Syllipsimopodi bideni, after President Joe Biden.Whether or not having an ancient octopus — or vampire squid — bearing your name is actually a compliment, the scientists say they intended admiration for the president’s science and research priorities.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

And 4,000 military families were forced out of their homes and are in hotels.Austin spoke with Hawaii government leaders on Monday to inform them of the decision, which he said will protect the population and the environment, and will also lay the groundwork for a more secure military fueling system.“This is the right thing to do,” Austin said in a statement. “Centrally-located bulk fuel storage of this magnitude likely made sense in 1943, when Red Hill was built. And Red Hill has served our armed forces well for many decades. But it makes a lot less sense now. ”U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said she has been encouraging the Pentagon to make the shutdown decision for weeks.“I have said from day one that ensuring the health and safety of the residents of Oahu is my top priority and I share the community’s big sigh of relief with this news,” said Hirono, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.The Pentagon said it will move to a more dispersed fueling system for military ships and aircraft in the Indo-Pacific. Based on the new assessment, the expanded system will be more cost effective and provide greater security by spreading the fuel supply more broadly across the region.The new plan, laid out in recommendations delivered to Austin by a study group, would increase the fuel contracts that the U.S. has with other territories and nations in the Indo-Pacific, and add several more tanker ships that are based at sea. There are currently less than a dozen tanker ships, so several more would have to be built.An assessment team that had been studying how to make the tanks safe to operate will now determine how to shut the tanks down and remove the fuel in an environmentally safe way. The team must report back to Austin by the end of April with recommendations.After the facility can operate again, the defueling will begin and the process is expected to take about a year, meaning it would be finished some time next year. Austin has asked the Navy secretary to plan a budget for all necessary corrective action for any prior fuel releases from the facility.Austin said the department will also work with state, national and local leaders to clean up the contamination and consider other uses for the property after the fueling plant is closed. And the military will also provide healthcare to the families and workers affected.U.S. Rep. Kaiali’i Kahele said the military must also make sure it cleans up the contaminated aquifer underneath the fuel tanks which. The Navy’s water system and Honolulu’s municipal water utility use that aquifer.“At this point, the extent of contamination and environmental damage is not yet known. We know fuel continues to drip, as we speak, from the rock formations into our fresh water aquifer right now,” the Hawaii Democrat said in a statement.The tanks can hold 250 million gallons (1.1 billion liters) of fuel, and they are at less than half capacity right now. Officials said that 13 of the 20 tanks have fuel in them, two are permanently closed and five are being repaired.The Navy hasn’t determined how the petroleum got in the water. Officials are investigating a theory that jet fuel spilled from a ruptured pipe last May and somehow entered a fire suppression system drain pipe. They suspect fuel then leaked from the second pipe on Nov. 20, sending it into the drinking water well.Weeks after the leak was discovered, Hawaii state officials and members of Congress began to demand the shutdown of the facility.The Navy in early February appealed the state’s closure order, and at the time Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said the appeal would give the military time “to make evidence-based and transparent decisions.”Kirby on Monday said the department realizes the closure of the fuel complex will not be a quick fix.“We have work to do,” he said. “But we do believe that this decision by the Secretary today marks a significant first step in the path forward.”U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said political leaders will need to make that the military follows through on its plans.“In order to implement this decision, we’re going to have to provide additional resources and hold (the Department of Defense’s) feet to the fire through congressional oversight,” he said.___Associated Press writer Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report from Honolulu."}, {"title": "4 Of 7 Killed In Iowa Tornadoes From Same Family: Sheriff", "text": "Four of the seven people killed in devastating storms that tore through central Iowa were members of the same family who were huddled together in the pantry of a home that was razed by a powerful tornado, authorities said.Two children, their father and their grandmother all died Saturday when a tornado hit the grandparents’ home near rural Winterset that didn’t have a basement. Family members said the children’s mother, 8-year-old brother, grandfather and uncle survived the storm, but they were injured.The children and their parents, from Blue Springs, Missouri, were visiting their grandmother, Melissa Bazley, 63, when the tornado hit. The storm killed Bazley, 37-year-old Michael Bolger and two of his three young children, 5-year-old Kinlee Bolger and 2-year-old Owen Bolger.A GoFundMe page for the family says Kuri Bolger, who is the children’s mother and Bazley’s daughter, was hospitalized after being seriously injured. Lynn Larson said her daughter-in-law, Kuri Bolger, underwent surgery on her leg Monday and faces another surgery on her arm to repair broken bones. Her oldest grandson was treated at the hospital and released.Larson said she and the rest of her family are “just devastated.”“I just can’t describe how wonderful Mike was. Everybody loved him,” Larson said. “It just rips your heart out. My grandchildren were wonderful. They were just the light of my life.”Two others killed in the tornado — Rodney Clark, 64, and Cecilia Lloyd, 72 — lived in homes just down the street from Bazley that were also hit by the tornado. It was rated an EF-4, with peak winds of 170 mph (274 kph), the National Weather Service said Monday. The tornado was on the ground for nearly 70 miles (113 kilometers), leaving the longest path of destruction since a 1984 tornado that carved a path 117 miles (188 kilometers) long.The seventh death came from Lucas County, about 54 miles (87 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines, when a separate tornado struck less than an hour later, injuring several other people. Officials there said Monday that Jesse Theron Fisher, 40, of Chariton, Iowa, died in the storm and another area resident remained hospitalized. The state Department of Natural Resources said that Fisher was in an RV at a campground at Red Haw State Park near Chariton when the storm struck.The storms that raked Iowa on Saturday were the deadliest to occur in the state since May 2008, when one tornado destroyed nearly 300 homes and killed nine people in the northern Iowa city of Parkersburg. Another tornado a month later killed four boys at the Little Sioux Boy Scout ranch in western Iowa.Saturday’s storms damaged or destroyed other homes and downed power lines and trees, causing some power outages.The tornadoes were followed by winter storms overnight Sunday into Monday that dropped about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) of snow in central Iowa and 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) in Mount Vernon in eastern Iowa.The snow prompted officials to cancel Monday’s planned storm cleanup efforts after hundreds of volunteers helped out on Sunday. The cleanup was expected to resume Tuesday, but more snow is in the forecast for Thursday, which could cause additional delays.Elsewhere, the National Weather Service said the storms generated an EF-1 tornado in southeastern Wisconsin near Stoughton that included winds up to 80 mph. The storm flattened trees, snapped power poles and blew out windows in homes. No injuries were reported.One expert estimated the storms Saturday likely caused more than $1 billion damage altogether.___The spelling of Kinlee Bolger’s first name has been corrected."}, {"title": "Mistakes Tourists Make While Visiting Arizona", "text": "The appeal of Arizona as a vacation spot is fairly obvious.

We asked Arizonans to share some of the faux pas they’ve observed over the years.From hiking blunders to missed food opportunities, here are 12 mistakes tourists often make while visiting Arizona ― and some advice for avoiding these errors during your travels.“Hydrate! Especially if you’re hiking. Tourists do not realize how essential water is in the desert and that heat can quickly creep up on you. Always having minimum a full water bottle with you could potentially be the difference between life and death. Especially during the summer.” ― Christina Nguyen, content creator at @h2ochristina“We see visitors underestimate the sun exposure and heat, arriving to the trail with not enough water and little to no sun protection. It’s best to have too much water than to have too little and recommend about 16 ounces or 0.5 liters per mile, and more if it’s strenuous. Most trailheads don’t have running water.” ― Lauren Franklin and Owen Steinwall, bloggers at The AZ Hikeaholics“We see tourists getting to the trailhead too late! Locals will get there early because the weather is cooler, and parking spots will fill up quickly.” ― Franklin and Steinwall“Make sure to research hiking spots and their parking lots before you go for it! Parking lots for hikes in Arizona are sometimes extremely small and don’t always have space for you.” ― Lacy Cain, founder of Wildjoy“The Valley of the Sun (Phoenix) is huge! You could be an hour away from someone in Phoenix yet you are both still in Phoenix. Look at the map and plan accordingly.” ― Paloma Guerrero, blogger at Glitter Glucose“It might be obvious, but the biggest mistake is visiting between the months of May to September ― best to enjoy Arizona during the good months and all its glory of hikes, outdoor activities, brunch outside, etc.” ― Jessica Bui, blogger at The Orange Home“If you want to experience all the beauty and nature here, travel to Arizona between October and April. It’s the best weather and you will actually enjoy the fun activities such as hiking! As a local, we do not like being outside during the summer months!” ― Aiesha Beasley, content creator and TikTok influencer“We get a lot of tourists that show up in the middle of the summer when it’s hotter than you know what and decide to go hiking with little or no water and then of course need to get rescued because they are falling apart on top of a mountain suffering from heatstroke and dehydration. If you visit Arizona during the summer, be prepared.” ― Chanté Fox, designer and blogger“Scottsdale is a well-known city in the Phoenix area, but there is so much more to explore in the valley other than Scottsdale if they ventured out of that bubble.” ― Beasley“Guests tend to underestimate all that downtown Phoenix has to offer. Sometimes even locals who are based in the suburbs miss out on all of the latest excitement in the downtown area. From new upscale dining to local breweries and unique cocktail culture to some of Arizona’s best museums and natural attractions such as the Desert Botanical Garden and a variety of hiking trails, there’s always something to see or do outside. Plus, nothing beats an opportunity to catch an Arizona sunset in real life!” ― Jon Erickson, market director of sales and marketing at Sheraton Phoenix Downtown“Few things instantly identify a visitor more than mispronunciation of our beloved Sonoran Desert icon, the saguaro cactus. Take a stroll through any of our public gardens and you’ll hear all sorts of references to ‘cigarros,’ in which case locals are tempted to respond that this is a no-smoking area! (For the record, it’s pronounced ‘sa-WAR-o.’) On a related note, the cholla cactus is pronounced ‘choya’ and not ‘chola’ or ‘challah’!” ― Lori A. Johnson, nature photographer“Make sure to rent a car! One of the best things to do here is to take scenic drives around our beautiful mountainous ranges. From the Apache Trail to Route 66 to Sedona-to-Flagstaff Byway, you are bound to see breathtaking sights.” ― Cain“Another mistake tourists make is not understanding a lot of our trails are in rocky desert, meaning they’re uneven and strenuous on the feet and ankles. We see a lot of rescues on the news of hikers that were too injured to get down the mountain. We recommend wearing sturdy shoes or boots and to use hiking poles if you’re comfortable with them.” ― Franklin and Steinwall“Tourists see our extensive urban hiking trail system with expansive views depicted in tourist brochures around the Phoenix area and prepare as if they’re out for a stroll in a typical city park, rather than a strenuous hike, by wearing inappropriate casual footwear, and failing to carry water, for starters. Almost every rescue that makes the evening news involves ill-prepared tourists, especially in summer when temperatures can reach 110 degrees or more, which is a dangerous time to hike for anyone, much less those not acclimated to the desert.” ― Johnson“Don’t only eat at nationwide chains while you’re here. We have the best LOCAL food! When you’re here, make a stop at a food truck to try a Sonoran Hot Dog (hot dog stuffed with pinto beans, salsa, bacon, cheese, etc.) or some fresh tacos. If you can make it down to Tucson, it’s one of the gastronomy capitals of the world with people coming from all over to try the cuisine.” ― Cain“Phoenix is the new LA. Make reservations ahead of time to all the hot spots! Some of my favorites are Glai Baan, Restaurant Progress, Fat Ox, and Vecina.” ― Bui“People have to remember that Google isn’t a local. Most of the ‘best places’ listed on there are only listed because they’ve put more dollars in their SEO strategies, not because it’s a hole-in-the-wall concept or French culinary-trained chefs curating farm-to-table menus. Social media is huge now, so I would encourage tourists to navigate those platforms for the do’s & don’ts. When I’m traveling, I use bucket list Instagrams like @miamibucketlist or @sdbucketlist for recommendations. I even take it a step further by finding local influencer pages and read through their travel guides, etc.” ― Ashley Muzzillo, event planner and content creator“Most people do not know that Arizona has large sections of tribal land, and it needs to be respected. There are about 20 million acres of tribal land which is about 27% of Arizona. Most tribes welcome visitors, but there are a lot of sacred off-limit areas that need to be respected. Understand where you are traveling and what you are doing to be respectful and get the proper permits if visiting.” ― Tyler Barks, photographer and videographer“There are certain areas in Maricopa County with no signal (dead spots).

(AP) — Huge wildfires in the Florida Panhandle forced veterans in a nursing home to evacuate Sunday alongside residents of more than 1,000 homes in an area still recovering from a Category 5 hurricane three years ago.Firefighters battled the 9,000-acre (about 3,642 hectare) Bertha Swamp Road fire and the 841-acre (340-hectare) Adkins Avenue fire, which have threatened homes and forced residents of at least 1,100 houses in Bay County, Florida to flee over the weekend. The Adkins Avenue fire destroyed two structures and damaged another 12 homes late Friday.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the larger Bertha Swamp Road fire “a big boy,” at a news conference in Panama City on Sunday afternoon. “It’s moving very quickly.”On Sunday, a third fire developed, forcing the evacuation of a 120-bed, state-operated nursing home in Panama City. Public transit was being used to move the residents at the Clifford Chester Sims State Veterans’ Nursing Home. Buses also were on standby in case the 1,300 inmates at the nearby Bay County Jail needed to be evacuated to other facilities.Hurricane Michael in 2018 left behind 72 million tons of destroyed trees that have provided fuel for the Bay County wildfires, according to the Florida Forest Service. The hurricane was directly responsible for 16 deaths and about $25 billion in damage in the U.S.Local authorities say they don’t know when residents will be able to return to their homes. The county opened a shelter at the Bay County Fairgrounds for displaced residents.“I know there has been frustration with people not being able to get back into their homes,” said Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford. “But we have had things that have popped up on a minute’s notice and really caused problems. As soon as we can, we will let people go back.”The Adkins Avenue fire has been burning in Bay County since Friday, forcing the evacuation of at least 600 homes, and it was 35% contained Sunday. Fire officials initially said it was 1,400 acres (567 hectares) but adjusted the size downward Sunday afternoon.The much-larger Bertha Swamp Fire started in neighboring Gulf County on Friday but spread to Bay and Calhoun counties Saturday, forcing the evacuation of scores of more homes. It was 10% contained as of Sunday.“It’s just hard to believe that something could be that big,” said Brad Monroe, chief of Bay County Emergency Services. “If you fly around it, it’s just incredible. It’s hard to comprehend how big, strong and fierce this fire is.”Florida Forest Service helicopters had dropped more than 103,000 gallons (about 468,000 liters) of water on the Adkins Avenue fire since Friday, and 25 bulldozers had been deployed to plow fire lines. Firefighters from all over Florida were deployed to the county to battle the blazes.“Unfortunately what we have going on today is almost a carbon copy of yesterday’s weather,” Joe Zwierzchowski, a spokesman for the Florida Forest Service, said Sunday morning. “We are looking at high, sustained winds of 10 to 15 (16 to 24 kilometers) miles per hour, gusting up to 20 to 25 miles (32 to 40 kilometers) per hour. So that’s going to make it a very dynamic situation.”Currently, there are nearly 150 wildfires burning more than 12,100 acres (about 4,900 hectares) throughout Florida, and the state is only at the very beginning of its wildfire season.“It is incredibly dry throughout the state and typically we see this kind of activity in the months of April and May,” Zwierzchowski said. “Seeing it in early March really gives us an indication of what the fire season is going to be like.”___Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida, and Julie Walker in New York City contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Official: 6 Dead As Large Tornado Roars Through Central Iowa", "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Six people were killed Saturday when a tornado swept through central Iowa, damaging buildings and knocking down trees and power lines, authorities said.Emergency management officials in Madison County said four were injured in addition to those killed when the tornado touched down in the area southwest of Des Moines at about 4:30 p.m. Among those killed were children and adults.Madison County Emergency Management Director Diogenes Ayala said 25 to 30 homes were badly damaged by the tornado.“This is the worst anyone has seen in a very long time,” he said.Officials didn’t identify those killed but said they were not all in the same location.Wendy Burkett told the Des Moines Register she and two of her three daughters were in their house Saturday afternoon when her husband, Tony, called her from a nearby shed where he was working and alerted her about a tornado warning.Burkett said she came outside and joined him in front of the house, looking down their driveway toward the southwest. “And then we saw it. The tornado,” she said. “There was debris flying around and it was getting louder and louder.”They hurried with their daughters to their basement as the tornado roared by within seconds. As they clung to each other, a window shattered outwards and water began spewing from the pipes, she said.But within about a minute, the tornado passed by, and while the family was unhurt, their home was in ruins amid debris all around, even in the trees.The National Weather Service in Des Moines tweeted later Saturday that initial photos and videos from the damage around the community of Winterset suggested it was at least an EF-3 tornado, capable of causing severe damage, on the Enhanced Fujita scale. It said weather service teams would investigate the damage Sunday and further assess a potential rating.Thunderstorms that spawned tornadoes moved through much of Iowa from the afternoon until Saturday night with storms also causing damage in the Des Moines suburb of Norwalk, areas just east of Des Moines and other areas of eastern Iowa.Officials reported a number of homes were damaged, roads were blocked by downed lines and tree branches were shredded by the strong winds. Photos tweeted on social media showed downed trees, debris and damaged roofs and vehicles.

They also have the neat ability to use their webs like balloons or parachutes to ride the wind.Originally they come from East Asia, but have been in the U.S. since at least 2013, when they most likely hitched a ride on shipping containers.But though some people find them a little freaky ― one Georgia resident referred to the arachnids as “a big no” ― scientists emphasize that they pose no threat to humans and so far haven’t been shown to have any negative environmental impacts.Last year, University of Georgia researchers said that the large numbers of spiders already seen in Georgia may actually be a good thing, since they were eating pests like mosquitoes.Now the school, which increasingly seems like it’s run by spiders, has issued a statement making a similar case.“There’s really nothing we can do to stop them,” a news release this week said. “But that’s not necessarily bad news.”Andy Davis, a research scientist at the university and another study co-author, urged people to have some compassion, even if the spiders make them feel icky.“People should try to learn to live with them,” he said. “If they’re literally in your way, I can see taking a web down and moving them to the side, but they’re just going to be back next year.”"}, {"title": "A Natural Gas Giant Is Waging A Sneaky War On A Minor Colorado Climate Policy", "text": "The natural gas industry bet billions of dollars that it can indefinitely extend its life as a “bridge fuel” away from coal-fired electricity to zero-carbon power sources.Now that renewables are eating into natural gas’s share of the electricity market, gas companies are trying to barricade themselves inside homes across the United States, hoping that slowing the switch from gas stoves and heating systems to cleaner alternatives will preserve a profit stronghold.In nearly two dozen states, that has meant successfully lobbying to ban cities from barring gas hookups in new buildings and mandating that developers go all-electric. But in Colorado, the nation’s largest gas-only utility has launched a new front group aimed at waging war against even modest proposals to nudge ratepayers toward electrification.Coloradans for Energy Access, an industry-run nonprofit that seeks to recast gas companies’ concerns as grassroots activism, is taking aim at a proposal state regulators are considering to end subsidies for new gas lines as part of the Centennial State’s goal to cut greenhouse gas output in half by the end of this decade.Audio HuffPost obtained of an internal meeting Coloradans for Energy Access held last month revealed that Texas-based utility Atmos Energy is playing a central role in the group.“Happy to be here on behalf of Coloradans for Energy Access. My full-time job, just so you all know, I work for Atmos Energy,” Jennifer Altieri, Atmos Energy’s vice president of public relations, said in a recording of the Feb. 7 presentation. “We’re the largest natural-gas-only distributor in the nation. That’s all we do.”Those last four words get to the heart of a widening fissure in the U.S. utility industry, which is the country’s No. 2 source of climate-changing emissions after automobiles. Some companies that sell both natural gas and electricity ― including major utilities in New York and California ― have begun to embrace the reality that decarbonization will mean growing their power sales at the expense of their gas businesses as ratepayers swap gas stoves, furnaces and appliances for electric alternatives.But gas stalwarts have dug in deeper. Instead of directing money toward building out new, electric-friendly revenue streams, those utilities are investing millions to fight any change to the status quo, despite clear warnings from scientists that doing so dooms U.S. efforts to curb global warming.“People are beginning to rally around getting gas combustion out of their homes around the nation,” said Rachel Golden, a principal at the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute’s carbon-free buildings program. “As fossil fuel companies see this progress, they’re investing millions to form these front groups to fight back and preserve their business.”Since going live in January with a website and an opinion article in The Colorado Sun, Coloradans for Energy Access has made opposing a proposal before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to remove subsidies for new gas lines and hasten the state’s shift toward electric appliances its priority. The regulatory body is hosting a hearing on the proposal Monday.Though gas advocates say failure to subsidize the industry’s expansion will make gas more expensive, supporters of shifting away from fossil fuels say building more gas lines locks customers in to decades more use of a fuel whose pollution and volatile price swings can be easily avoided with modern technology. The concern over the highly technical issue highlights the true nature of the group’s constituency, said Amy Turner, a senior fellow at Columbia University’s Sabin Center on Climate Change Law.“It’s not a headline issue of a natural gas ban or mandating electric or even net-metering policies,” Turner said. “These are very niche, very in the weeds. Someone had to do a lot of work to identify these policy elements and mobilize opposition against them.”Atmos Energy, a nearly $16 billion company, partnered in that effort with FTI Consulting, the powerhouse consultancy behind many other fossil fuel industry propaganda campaigns. FTI employees staffed Energy in Depth and Western Wire, two pro-fossil fuel blogs that disguise themselves as journalism outlets.FTI, based in Washington, D.C., also designed, staffed or even ran a network of fake grassroots groups with such names as Texans for Natural Gas, the Arctic Energy Center and Main Street Investors Coalition that The New York Times, in an investigation of FTI’s fossil fuel work, described as deliberately appearing “to be separate efforts to amplify local voices or speak up for regular people.”During the nearly 50-minute call in February, William Allison, a senior director at FTI, said Coloradans for Energy Access’s purpose was to “protect and preserve access to natural gas in the state” and “make sure people have that choice and that freedom to choose the energy that suits them the most.”Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest utility, is also backing the group, as are a series of unions that work on fossil fuel projects. Some homebuilders groups ― who argue that designing houses and apartments for electric appliances raises costs, despite the fact that retrofitting those buildings to go electric after they’re built costs far more ― are also listed as part of the coalition.Atmos Energy did not respond to a request for comment. FTI Consulting spokesperson Matthew Bashalany declined to “comment on, confirm or deny client engagements or reports of client engagements” but directed HuffPost to Gary Arnold, a leader at a Colorado pipefitters union that is part of Coloradans for Energy Access.“Coloradans for Energy Access is a member driven and funded organization that’s focused on educating the public on the critical role that natural gas plays today in lowering emissions and keeping families warm at home,” Arnold, a business manager at Denver Pipefitters Local 208, wrote in an email. “Natural gas ― and the infrastructure that supports it ― provides good jobs [and] keeps [costs] low in homes and the workplace.”The launch of Coloradans for Energy Access comes as local gas utilities have found increasingly crafty ways of disrupting policies to promote electrification, which advocates say is critical to not only eliminating the 13% of U.S. emissions buildings spew but also reducing the damage indoor air pollution from gas stoves and furnaces does to human health.Late last year, Oklahoma Natural Gas, the state’s largest gas provider, urged regulators to allow it to impose an “exit fee” on ratepayers who quit gas service to go electric, forcing them to pay off up to $1,400 of the company’s debt.St. Louis-based Spire Energy, a $3.5 billion gas firm, last month tried to torpedo a proposal in the next set of generic U.S. building codes to expand electric vehicle charging in commercial structures. The move came nearly three years after gas utilities teamed up to gut a series of pro-electrification provisions from the last set of U.S. building codes.On the call, Atmos’s Altieri boasts that the company has helped pass pro-gas legislation in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kansas and Kentucky, which she described as “beautiful future states.”“It’s been very successful,” she said, but noted that Colorado’s “intricacies” show “the dire need for a coalition like this to not just have one voice, the gas utilities out there or just propane, it has to be multiple voices that are out there protecting our products.”"}, {"title": "Russia Shells Europe's Largest Nuclear Plant In Ukraine, Sparking Fire", "text": "Russian troops shelled Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine, prompting worries of an international disaster amid the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion of the country.The shelling took place at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, a city about 400 miles from Kyiv. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it had spoken with Ukrainian officials, who said there are no changes in radiation levels at the site, which provides about 25% of Ukraine’s power.Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, confirmed the reports on Thursday evening, saying a fire had broken out. He called for an immediate cease-fire to allow emergency officials to stop the blaze and said Russian troops were firing on the facility “from all sides.”“If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger” than the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, Kuleba tweeted. “Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!”Reuters added later that the fire was in a training building outside the plant, although it could not verify its seriousness.The Ukrainian State Emergency Service said early Friday morning the blaze had been extinguished, and there were no deaths or injuries linked to the shelling.Nuclear experts said the plant’s reactors are a different type than the ones used at Chernobyl and that emergency safety measures should kick in. The shelling should pose little risk if the containment vessels aren’t damaged and outside power can be restored to the site, although they warned that any military action at a nuclear facility was a danger.“We don’t know the status of the system or the power and until we do, we won’t know the full extent of the risk,” tweeted Jon B. Wolfsthal, a former adviser to then-Vice President Joe Biden. “Yes, a fire at any nuclear plant is a bad thing but there are a few things to know.”Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant, told a Ukrainian television station that one of the site’s six nuclear reactors was on fire. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but has nuclear fuel inside, he said. Open pools where spent nuclear fuel rods have been cooling are also a concern, The New York Times noted.Tuz added that firefighters initially weren’t able to get near the plant because they are being shot at, The Associated Press added.Rafael Mariano Gross, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, also called for an immediate halt in military action near the plant, saying the body would continue to support Ukraine in hopes of maintaining nuclear safety and security."}, {"title": "A Battle Over Building Codes May Be The Most Important Climate Fight You’ve Never Heard Of", "text": "After failing to overturn an election expected to hasten the transition away from fossil fuels, conservative industry groups last year managed to get future votes canceled and tightened their grip over the process used to develop new building codes.The Biden administration protested, along with dozens of major cities, but the battle over a critical tool for shrinking the fourth-largest source of the United States’ climate-changing emissions got little attention.Now, fresh drama is afoot as the International Code Council writes the next set of codes, after a single email secretly sent by a gas utility nearly gutted a proposal widely seen as vital to increasing the adoption of electric vehicles.Last March, the private consortium of industry associations and municipal governments that crafts the generic codes adopted in all 50 states revoked local officials’ long-held right to vote on the final version of energy-related codes, replacing the election with a technocratic committee that gives companies equal say to public servants. Yet the ICC, as it is known, said the new process would make it easier for the highly technical building specifications to take bigger leaps toward decarbonizing the nation’s homes, stores and office towers.Instead, advocates now fear the latest incident illustrates how polluters enjoy even more control in a process over which they already wielded influence.The issue erupted on Feb. 9 in an email chain among members of the committee charged with authoring the energy codes for commercial buildings, one of two such panels formed as part of the procedure that replaced the old government voting system.After weeks of discussion over a proposal to require developers to include the circuitry to charge electric vehicles in more new buildings ― which can cost more than six times more to retrofit into a structure after it’s built ― the chairman of the committee, Duane Jonlin, abruptly announced in an email that he had decided to strike the proposal from the code. Instead, he said it belonged in the “appendix” that serves as a bonus menu that some more ambitious cities and towns may choose to adopt, according to copies of the exchange HuffPost obtained from a source who requested anonymity because the internal emails were private.More emails HuffPost obtained via a public records request reveal what triggered the hasty shift: Spire Energy, the $3.5 billion St. Louis-based gas company, privately reached out to challenge the electric vehicle provisions.Hours before Jonlin yanked the proposal, Thomas Schultz, a technical services analyst at Spire, emailed a consultant named Shaunna Mozingo to complain that the electric vehicle measure did not belong in the code. She, in turn, forwarded the email to Jonlin, who also serves as an energy code adviser to the city of Seattle. By that afternoon, Jonlin told committee members he had “made an executive decision” to remove the electric vehicle requirements from the code.In an interview last week, Jonlin told HuffPost he now planned to reverse that decision. But it’s still early in the process of writing the codes set to debut in 2024, and advocates say the about-face came with no guarantees that the electric vehicle policy won’t be nixed again in the months to come. Reached by phone, Schultz declined to comment. Mozingo confirmed in a voicemail that she sent the email.The incident ― wonky and soporific as it may seem ― highlights serious challenges for the nation’s energy codes at a moment when Americans struggle to afford rising utility bills and scientists warn that anything short of a revolutionary overhaul of energy systems threatens climate catastrophe.In its latest assessment of the world’s best peer-reviewed research, the United Nations’ climate science panel on Monday found global warming was happening with greater speed and intensity than previously understood, but singled out new housing construction as an “opportunity” to respond at scale to the crisis. Meanwhile, each new building constructed to older, less climate-friendly standards adds more carbon to the atmosphere and increases the total cost of decarbonization, since those structures will eventually need retrofits that cost far more to add later.And even with nearly 500,000 electric vehicles sold in the U.S. last year, the Biden administration has struggled to marshal the federal funding to provide the charging infrastructure required to make battery-powered cars competitive with incumbent models that benefit from the nation’s nearly 117,000 gas stations.“The new process gives outside power to the gas utility industry, which has a vested interest in the indefinite sales of fossil fuels,” said Charlie Spatz, a researcher with the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute who filed the public records request for Jonlin’s emails. “​​The gutting of the energy code-making process has provided the fossil fuel industry with an even larger megaphone, leaving committee chairs in a challenging situation.”Tailpipes and smokestacks have long served as the symbols of climate destruction, and with good reason: Traditional cars, gas- and coal-fired power plants, and factories are, in that order, the three largest sources of carbon emissions in the U.S., comprising 77% of the country’s output in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In fourth-place are homes and businesses, whose gas stovetops, oil furnaces and other fossil-fueled appliances comprise another 13%. But those are just greenhouse gases specific to buildings; counting the portion of power plant pollution from buildings’ energy use brings that figure up to nearly 40%.The United States’ sheer size and its federalized system of government severely limit the power cities and towns wield over the nation’s auto fleet, electricity system and manufacturing sector. But mayors, city councils and county officials hold tremendous sway over what kinds of houses, apartments, offices and storefronts developers can build within their jurisdictions. So when cities and towns pledge to slash their climate-changing emissions to reduce local air pollution and do their part to keep global warming from exceeding a catastrophic 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial averages, buildings are some of the few pollution sources they can meaningfully reduce.Building codes are incredibly complex and technical, and few municipalities have the resources to write their own. Likewise, the building industry, from contractors to material manufacturers, needs some uniformity in standards. Enter the ICC, which every three years updates a generic set of building codes that every state and some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean legally recognize as the standard.For years, the ICC convened industry groups, governments and environmentalists to hash out what should be in the latest version of the code. Then the government bureaucrats charged with enforcing the codes would vote on the final version. In 2019, however, the normally sleepy process was jolted when droves of U.S. cities ― frustrated by the paltry efficiency gains over the last few code cycles ― organized to vote in favor of measures to drastically ramp up the version of the energy code that took effect last year. It was an overwhelming success. The 2018 code improved efficiency by barely 1%. By contrast, the 2021 code they approved the next year increased efficiency by up to 14%, promising reductions of as much as 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year by 2030, equal to shutting down 47 coal-fired power plants.Industry groups immediately cried foul. The National Association of Home Builders and the Leading Builders of America, which had long held power over the ICC behind closed doors, challenged the legitimacy of the election, claiming that many of the government officials who cast ballots were ineligible to vote. The protest failed.But the American Gas Association, a trade group for natural gas utilities, appealed five of the provisions that voters had overwhelmingly approved. The ICC’s three-member appeals board overturned all five, including ones making it easier and cheaper for homeowners to use electric water heaters and electric vehicles. Of more than two dozen appeals filed by industry groups in total, those were the only ones granted.The ICC, in a move that puzzled many longtime observers, then proposed ending all future elections and switching to a committee-consensus model that gives governments and industry equal representation. The consortium said more than two-thirds of jurisdictions were operating under old versions of the code, so creating a more balanced approach was key to increasing adoption of the latest mandates.Yet the change drew fierce protest from local governments, environmentalists and architects. The Biden administration’s Department of Energy warned the ICC that ending voting would “be detrimental to an appropriate process with appropriate transparency” and stunt “important economic and environmental benefits at the local level.”Unfazed, the ICC announced the change in March 2021 anyway. The American Public Gas Association, another trade group representing gas utilities, told its board of directors the new system “should be beneficial,” according to an internal document HuffPost first published last year.It took the ICC four months to appoint members to the two committees writing the 2024 energy codes for commercial and residential buildings, which it is expected to finalize next spring. The consortium still has yet to name anyone to an independent third committee that is supposed to help dictate the speed at which codes slash carbon emissions.That separate body, which the ICC said will be constituted by early summer, is critical. When the ICC appeals board gutted some of the 2021 code’s biggest climate measures at gas utilities’ behest, it justified the decision by stating that the energy code could only include provisions that saved energy, such as insulation or modern light fixtures. Parts of the code that served primarily to aid the energy transition, by contrast, belonged in the appendix, where some cities and states could choose to adopt or ignore provisions seen as more political in a country where many still dismiss the reality of climate science.But 60% of states don’t allow cities and towns to adopt codes that differ from those used statewide, meaning the appendices are only available to a small fraction of U.S. municipalities.Squeezed for time and worried it would just be removed from the code at a later point, Jonlin ― a liberal longtime advocate of cutting emissions, who had opposed eliminating the government vote ― said he turned down the electric vehicle proposal out of fear that industry would successfully contest it anyway.“My big concern is that we not waste time,” he said by phone. “I want to make sure we don’t get to the end of the process and then have a challenge that then overrules us and then we have to do it over. That’s my big motivator: to make sure we’re doing it right the first time given the extremely limited time.”But the decision riled the committee, which ― lacking the as-yet-unnamed climate panel to refer to ― asked the ICC staff for advice. An ICC employee last week delivered a surprise verdict, telling the committee in a memo that the electric vehicle proposal could, in his opinion, be part of the code.“I’m going to reverse course,” Jonlin said. “We can have it the way it was originally.”Ryan Colker, a vice president at the ICC, said the incident illustrates that the new, bureaucratic way of writing the energy codes is working.“In this case, the new consensus process actually did what it was supposed to do,” he said by phone. “It brought light to an objection from someone, which then resulted in conversations within the committee and a resolution that ultimately allowed the committee to continue its deliberation and decide the best approach moving forward.”But the issue isn’t resolved, said Kim Cheslak, the director of codes at the New Buildings Institute and a member of the commercial committee. Jonlin put the electric vehicle proposal back into the code on the advice of an ICC staffer who does not speak on behalf of the all-powerful appeals board, which struck down similar policies during the last code cycle. She fears that could easily happen again.“It’s just one staffer’s opinion,” she said. “It’s not worth the paper it’s written on if the board can just overturn it anyway.”The two committees are currently reviewing 450 separate proposals, with plans to complete drafts of the codes by this June. Later this summer, the ICC will make the proposed codes available for public comment. The entire process aims to wrap up by the start of summer 2023."}, {"title": "Koalas, Other Wildlife Drowned And Battered By Australia's Flood Disaster", "text": "Wildlife groups in eastern Australia are gravely concerned for animals as catastrophic floods sweep through the region, leaving many critters waterlogged, injured, stranded or without food.At least 14 people have died after torrential rain unleashed devastating flash floods in the states of Queensland and New South Wales over the past week. Thousands of others are homeless, without power or trapped in regions cut off by floodwaters, and more storms are still forecast to hit some areas. Many communities further south around Sydney were placed under evacuation orders Thursday.As floodwaters in some areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales start to recede, wildlife rescue groups are starting to field calls about animals affected by the disaster. Many vets and local rescuers have been flooded themselves, leaving limited sources to provide aid.In the northern New South Wales city of Lismore — which experienced its worst flood event in history this week, with water engulfing entire homes — a local volunteer for the WIRES wildlife rescue group said she was concerned that many small mammals like echidnas did not survive.“Unfortunately, it’s a really bad time of the year for echidnas because they’ve got all their puggles in burrows,” WIRES staffer Leoni Byron Jackson said. “So those areas have gone underwater. Those babies have drowned.”She said one woman had contacted her after finding an echidna clinging to a power pole ― a rare sight for the ground-dwelling animal ― while she was evacuating with her family. They were able to save it, bringing it with them to higher ground and releasing it.“Extreme weather events like the current floods can result in stress and shock for wildlife, with birds frequently most impacted as they become waterlogged and unable to fly,” a WIRES spokesperson told HuffPost.“Seabirds and young sea turtles can also be swept off course and found exhausted on beaches or sometimes many kilometers inland.”Wallabies, birds, bandicoots, koalas, kangaroos and their young are among the animals that have been reported as hurt, stranded, or needing to be rescued to WIRES, which is responding in both flood-hit states.Rescuers expect call volumes to keep going up as waters recede and communities begin to pick up the pieces.The greater impact, however, is still hard to predict.“It’s a bit like what happened with the fires because we’ve never seen anything as bad before,” the WIRES spokesperson said in a phone call.A representative for Queensland’s Department of Environment and Science said assessments were taking place across national parks and facilities to determine the extent of the damage. Its New South Wales counterpart said the situation was still unfolding.In the Sunshine Coast region of Queensland, a local woman made the news for reviving a seemingly lifeless platypus that she found washed up near a bridge.“I just kind of dropped in the knees and I don’t even know why I did it,” Mary Valley resident Lady Penelope told HuffPost. “I think I was just so over the loss, you know? And I just started doing those little two finger compressions they teach to do on babies that aren’t breathing. And much to my surprise, it just like sputtered and coughed and something came out its mouth and it started breathing.”“I had a few happy tears and just sat down in the mud beside it.”After about 10 minutes, “It sort of looked at me and blinked its eyes and then just walked back to the water,” she said.The Gold Coast’s Currumbin Wildlife Hospital said Thursday it had been inundated with animals and had admitted more than 100 in just a few days.Dr. Chris Brown, a well-known Australian vet and television host, said ground-dwelling animals like lizards, echidnas and snakes would struggle the most, though possums and birds were also being flooded out of tree hollows, and koala joeys separated from their mothers.“Our wildlife have been through a lot over the last 4 years so let’s hope they can find a way through this challenge,” he wrote on Instagram.In recent years, Australia has faced droughts, heatwaves, the devastating 2019-2020 wildfires, and now historic flooding. Climate scientists say these extreme weather events will become more likely as climate change worsens.For wildlife that survives the floodwaters, the dangers are still real. The risks include car trauma (when dazed animals cross roads), hypothermia, or malnutrition from loss of food sources and habitat.Brisbane-based wildlife group The Rescue Collective said one local rescuer had saved 13 koalas from floodwaters in three days.The iconic animals were listed as endangered earlier this year amid plummeting populations, due to climate change and habitat loss. Tens of thousands of koalas were hurt or killed in the catastrophic bushfires two years ago.Other footage from the Queensland capital city, Brisbane, showed a man swimming down a suburban street supporting a wallaby struggling to swim in deep water.People who come across wildlife in floodwaters are instructed to contact vets, wildlife hospitals and rescue groups like WIRES. If safe to do so, rescuers suggest drying the animal with a towel, wrapping it in fabric to keep it warm, and placing it in a clean, covered box in a dark place while waiting for help to arrive.Putting out boxes and towels can also provide shelter for animals that have fled to higher ground.The longer-term impact of the flooding will be especially apparent in coastal waters, according to Richard Leck, WWF-Australia’s head of oceans.For marine species, once the significant short-term risks of debris entanglement pass, pollution issues remain for many years. The far-reaching effects can cause changes in species’ distributions, damage to reefs, and population decline for marine life.In Moreton Bay, a rich habitat for marine species northeast of Brisbane, “We’ve seen massive sediment pollution washing from the catchments that will smother seagrasses for foraging food for species like turtles and dugongs,” Leck said.Dugongs are likely to move further offshore, “but research has found that turtles, they tend not to move,” Leck said. “It will be probably in six to 12 months ... you will start to see really significant impact on turtle species because they’ll simply not have enough food to eat.”"}, {"title": "Biden Says Energy Plan Will Fight Climate Change, Inflation In State Of The Union Speech", "text": "President Joe Biden honed a pragmatic new message on climate change in his first State of the Union speech Tuesday evening, recasting his sweeping proposal to spend more than any country ever has on clean energy as a way to simultaneously combat the rise in U.S. planet-heating emissions and inflation.Biden promised that fighting climate change would translate into an average $500 per year in energy savings for American households. The figure came from an October analysis by the Rhodium Group, a widely respected consultancy.As he’s done repeatedly throughout his first year in office, Biden emphasized that he views confronting climate change as an opportunity to create high-wage jobs in renewable energy and manufacturing, and set the United States up to compete directly with China.He pledged to build out 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations and replace lead pipes as part of 4,000 infrastructure projects the president said were already underway. Next he promised to “start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.”“It is never a good bet to bet against the American people,” Biden said. “We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways all across America. And we’ll do it to withstand the devastating effects of climate change and promote environmental justice.”Biden’s address comes one day after the United Nations released yet another sobering climate change report, which concludes that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than previously known and that the window to “secure a livable and sustainable future” is rapidly closing.“Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your home and your businesses to be energy efficient and get a tax credit,” Biden said. “Double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind and so much more. Lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month that you’re not going to have to pay at the pump.”Inflation, he said, is “robbing” Americans.“One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I think I have a better plan to fight inflation: Lower your costs, not your wages. That means make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. Instead of relying on foreign supply chains — let’s make it in America.”With Russia financing its war in Ukraine with oil wealth and in the wake of scientists’ latest grim climate warning, Biden finds himself under enormous pressure to take one of two very different paths: lean into fossil fuels or move as quickly as possible toward renewable energy.Republicans argue now is the time to increase domestic production of the fossil fuels that are driving global warming. They have attempted to pin the blame for Russian President Vladmir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on Biden, accusing him of financing Putin’s war by importing Russian oil, and are citing the ongoing conflict to justify more drilling at home.Ahead of the president’s speech Tuesday, House Republican leadership held a press conference where they slammed Biden for waging what they called a “war on American energy independence.” At the event, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) produced a printed list of immediate steps Biden should take to correct course, including ending a pause on new federal oil and gas leasing and permitting and fast-tracking natural gas export permits. The list is strikingly similar to one that the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s largest U.S. trade association, sent to the Whtie House on Tuesday.Meanwhile, climate and environmental groups are accusing Biden of not moving fast enough to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from polluting energy sources. In a press call earlier this week, members of the Build Back Fossil Free coalition called on the president to declare a climate emergency and use his executive authority to halt new fossil fuel projects. And climate group Evergreen Action published a report detailing six actions they want Biden to take to combat climate change, including regulating pollution from the power sector, investing in clean energy manufacturing and phasing out fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and waters."}, {"title": "14 Takeaways From The Latest U.N. Study On Climate Change’s Deadly Toll", "text": "Pollution-fueled climate change has already irreversibly damaged civilization and nature alike, and, while cities have begun to fortify themselves, the catastrophic new temperatures the planet is on track to reach in the coming decades will render much of that adaptation futile.That’s the alarming finding of the United Nations’ latest temperature-check on global warming.The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s premier climate research body, provides a sweeping analysis of climate impacts and vulnerability, a summary of which was released Monday, asserting that “the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger” than past U.N. assessments.The conclusions are broadly described and inherently conservative, the result of a consensus process between 270 top scientists from 67 countries whose competing political interests are perhaps best illustrated by the omission of clear language about such issues as fossil fuels, nuclear power, carbon dioxide removal technology and methane gas. A study from another of the IPCC’s working groups, focusing on solutions, is due out next month, and will likely tackle more of those thorny topics.But the report emphasizes what millions of people can already intuit from dramatic shifts in weather patterns: Ways of life that sustained generations are coming to an abrupt and chaotic end, causing great suffering that world governments’ responses so far have proven woefully inadequate to ease, much less reverse.“We simultaneously need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to reduce the risks of climate change and address losses and damages that are already being experienced,” Adelle Thomas, an author of the report and researcher at the University of Bahamas, said in a call with reporters. “And we have a very limited amount of time to do this.”The effects of warming have already spread deadly diseases and increased mental illnesses. A mass exodus has begun as people in every region of the globe flee homes made inhospitable by climate change, with small island nations hit hardest. Drought and flooding is driving food insecurity and malnutrition in Africa, Central and South America. Ecosystems on every continent, in every topography, and in all oceans have experienced changes in structure and locations where animals and plants live as a result of warming that the report’s authors can attribute to warming with high degrees of certainty.There are myriad ways human societies can change to bend the curve of warming, including more nature conservation, a rapid shift to zero-carbon energy sources, and near-infinitely more financial resources devoted to cutting the output of planet-heating gasses and distributed far more widely among the world’s almost 8 billion people.But so far, “lack of funding, lack of political capacity and governance, [and] lack of commitment” have kept the planet on a devastating trajectory, said William Solecki, a co-author of the report and geographer at the City University of New York’s Hunter College.“The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health,” the report’s summary concludes. “Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.”Here are some of the key takeaways from the new report:What was long treated as a far-off threat is now a tangible part of life on Earth. Rising seas are swallowing low-lying islands and inundating coastal communities. Excessive drought is causing water shortages in the U.S. Southwest and Africa. Violent storms and heavy rains are wreaking havoc across the globe. And warming ocean waters are causing coral reefs to collapse and fisheries to quickly move toward the poles.Still, nations are dragging their feet when it comes to confronting planetary warming.“Globally, the issue of climate change has become quite well understood and that has increased public awareness,” Solecki said. “That has not translated into significant actions.”In North America, climate misinformation and the politicization of climate science remain ongoing barriers to aggressive climate action, the report notes. As if to serve as an exclamation point to that finding, the U.S. Supreme Court — staffed by a supermajority of right-wing justices, including at least one who questions the science of climate change and has direct family ties to the oil industry — is scheduled to begin hearing a case that could limit the federal government’s ability to regulate carbon emissions.The world has made progress adapting to mounting climate impacts, but researchers found that those efforts have been “fragmented,” “unequally distributed” and largely targeted at dealing with water problems. It’s already far from enough and, once we hit higher temperatures, it’ll be even less helpful.“The earlier the adaptation measures are implemented, the more the world will benefit because the potential to reduce climate risks through adaptation is higher until mid-century,” notes an FAQ released alongside Monday’s report. “At higher levels of warming, the effectiveness of most land- and water-based adaptation options starts declining, and the extent of residual risks increases, as do the chances of future unintended consequences.”In the face of climate disasters, many governments are taking a shortsighted, counterproductive approach to adaptation that not only fails to look holistically at climate impacts over time, but may worsen them. This includes building “inflexible infrastructure that cannot be adjusted easily or affordably” — think new construction projects on waterfronts that, even under optimistic scenarios, are slated to be underwater in the next few decades. It also means fortifying certain parts of cities, for example, while leaving out vulnerable communities “which cannot afford to move or adapt.”Since 2010, more of the world’s population has lived in cities than rural areas. As a result, strategies to hunker down in the face of climate problems — either with more air conditioning on hot days or better planning to deal with water issues — are overwhelmingly geared toward urban places. But that doesn’t mean everyone is covered. As more people come from the countryside to cities looking for work — a trend that is increasing as drought or pests make farming harder — poor newcomers are crowding into unplanned slums on the fringes of urban centers. Think, for example, of Rio de Janeiro’s favelas, where mudslides are a growing risk, or Lagos’ floating Makoko neighborhood, where makeshift homes on stilts face floods and waterborne illness.The report concludes: “There is limited evidence of investment in the informal settlements hosting the most vulnerable urban residents.”The migration from the countryside, meanwhile, leaves many of those who remain in rural areas in even more precarious situations, with even fewer resources coming their way.More so than previous IPCC reports, Monday’s hammers home the relationship between human, ecosystem and climate health. Heat waves and other climate impacts are devastating ecosystems upon which humans rely. And degraded lands and waters can not only negatively impact the health of nearby communities, but further exacerbate planetary warming and other environmental threats.The report finds that “human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent” and “current unsustainable development patterns are increasing exposure of ecosystems and people to climate hazards.”“We need to remember we are part of the nature around us, and not its owners,” said Edwin Castellanos, a report author and climate change researcher at Universidad del Valle in Guatemala.The findings make a clear case for conserving 30 to 50% of all lands and waters around the globe to combat the dual climate and biodiversity crises. “Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development,” reads a summary for policymakers.The Biden administration has set a goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030.Despite climate contrarians’ false claims about carbon dioxide emissions being “good” for food production, current and future climate change poses a monumental threat to food security.Already, climate change has slowed the overall growth of crop productivity, the report finds. Fisheries are suffering due to ocean warming and acidification, and extreme weather and climate events have exposed millions around the globe to food insecurity. Future warming is forecast to exacerbate existing problems by weakening soil health, disrupting pollination and fueling drought, with already vulnerable populations most at risk.“Overall, the picture is stark for food systems,” Rachel Bezner Kerr, a report author and professor at Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, said during a call with reporters. “No one is left unaffected by climate change.”The loss of species is one of the clearest examples of how anthropogenic climate change is already altering the planet in irreversible ways.Of 976 species of plants and animals the researchers examined, 47% suffered local population extinctions linked to climate change, with creatures like the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent, wiped out in Australia’s recent fires and heat waves.“The percentage of local losses is getting high enough to start affecting ecosystem integrity and stability and its own resistance to climate change,” Camille Parmesan, a report author and climate scientist at the University of Plymouth, told reporters.The risk of biodiversity loss only grows with every bit of additional future warming. At 1.5 degrees Celsius, between 3 and 14% of species in terrestrial ecosystems are likely to face “very high risk of extinction,” the report found. Those numbers climb to between 3 to 18% at 2 degrees, 3 to 29% at 3 degrees, and 3 to 39% at 4 degrees.Increased rain has spread toxic bacteria and diarrheal illnesses like cholera, while wildfire smoke and drought-fueled dust in the air has triggered lung and heart diseases. Mental health problems are also on the rise as trauma and depression afflict those who survive extreme weather shocks or lose their livelihoods, homes and cultures.“People are suffering and dying right now from climate change, and we are not seeing an investment to try and make sure we are prepared for an even warmer future,” said Kristie Ebi, a report author and health professor at the University of Washington.In many of the world’s metropoles, the housing supply has failed to keep pace with demand from growing populations, sending costs soaring; increasing homelessness; and spurring unsafe, unplanned and poorly integrated communities. Existing buildings, meanwhile, rely heavily on fossil fuels and waste energy via drafty windows and walls. Perhaps counterintuitively, therein lies a hopeful finding from the report: Cities need more new housing anyway, so building climate-friendly structures dovetails nicely with existing demands.“Continuing rapid growth in urban populations and unmet needs for healthy, decent, affordable and sustainable housing and infrastructure are a global opportunity to integrate inclusive adaptation strategies into development,” the report reads.For years now, the European Union and the United Kingdom have directed billions of dollars in subsidies meant for clean energy toward power plants that burn wood or other plant matter. It spewed carbon into the air, but — the thinking goes — the regrowth of trees or other crops also sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere. Now, increasingly, so-called biomass or bioenergy companies that benefited from those subsidies are pushing to expand their menu of government handouts to include ones geared toward systems to permanently pull carbon from the sky, promising that technology to capture CO2 at wood-burning power plants’ smoke stacks will make their operations carbon “negative.”This claim has long been disputed by environmentalists, who say these companies create more pollution than they clear up, and the report seems to show that’s for good reason. The industry and the tree farms it plants to offset emissions are messing with ecosystems that wildlife and local people rely on: “bioenergy, with or without carbon capture and storage, can compound climate-related risks to biodiversity, water and food security, and livelihoods, especially if implemented at large scales, especially in regions with insecure land tenure.”Last summer, the historic drought parching the American West took a huge toll on the hydropower dams that provide a huge chunk of the electricity that keeps the lights on in states like California, Nevada and Utah. At one point in August, the California regulators shut down the 644-megawatt Edward Hyatt hydroelectric power plant after water levels at the Oroville Dam Reservoir plunged to just 24% of capacity. The problem is likely to get worse.Dams can adapt to 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees Celsius, equal to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming, the report states. But at higher levels, protective measures become less effectiveAs warming worsens, societies have honed few substantive strategies to aid the 3.6 billion people globally living in the countryside. But one of the more prescriptive parts of the report offers clear ways to help. One would be cash handouts from governments to give farmers and nomadic people more resources to help themselves in the face of crop failure or livestock deaths. Another is job programs to meet growing climate needs, whether that is planting trees, fortifying infrastructure or guarding forests against loggers.From the study: “Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programmes, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.”It’s no secret that global financing to deal with climate impacts has favored the world’s capitals of capital, whether that’s seawalls in Amsterdam, raised roads in Miami or desalination plants in Abu Dhabi. Money has also flowed disproportionately to highly visible big-ticket engineering projects, in no small part because that cash is usually directed by national or supranational governments, or big global financiers.But more money is needed on the local level, where the vital and underfunded work of maintaining and improving existing infrastructure is done, the report found. “Access to finance is most difficult for city, local and non-state actors and in conditions where governance is fragile,” the report states.The environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth said the U.S. and other rich countries had tried to remove mentions of property losses and damages from climate change from the report. In a statement on Sunday, the group condemned the industrial world — which has spewed the vast majority of cumulative emissions into the atmosphere, with the U.S. contributing the most to the mess — for the “disgrace” of the “cowardly decisions” that “have led us here, to the brink of climate catastrophe.”“Developed countries’ attempts to remove the concept of loss and damage, and the finance for it from the IPCC report, was largely thwarted, but we condemn this resistance by those most responsible for the climate crisis,” Meena Raman, an advocate with Friends of the Earth Malaysia, said in a statement. “This has been a shameless attempt to wriggle off the hook.”John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, said the U.N. report “paints a dire picture of the impacts already occurring because of a warmer world and the terrible risks to our planet if we continue to ignore science.”“The question at this point is not whether we can altogether avoid the crisis — it is whether we can avoid the worst consequences,” he said in a statement."}, {"title": "PHOTOS: Deadly 'Rain Bomb' Leaves Parts Of Eastern Australia Underwater", "text": "SYDNEY, Australia ― At least eight people have died after flash floods swept through parts of Australia’s east coast over the weekend and on Monday.Torrential rain lashed the state of Queensland last week and over the weekend, leaving its southeastern regions and parts of the capital city, Brisbane, underwater. Images and videos revealed main roads and homes swallowed by floodwaters, large boats and jetties floating unmoored along the swollen Brisbane River and severe damage to property and vehicles.One video recorded Sunday showed a houseboat colliding with a ferry terminal, then sinking. Onlookers pulled a 70-year-old man who was aboard the houseboat from the water. Although he was uninjured, the boat was destroyed.The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said Monday that up to 18,000 homes had been flooded across the region. Over 1,500 people were in evacuation centers and more than 1,000 schools were closed.Many Brisbane residents also lost power, with energy providers warning it may be days before it was safe to restore it.On Sunday, Palaszczuk called the weather event a “rain bomb,” and described unrelenting “waves of water just coming down.”The disaster is the worst of its kind in a decade for Queensland, which faced destructive flooding in 2011 that left 35 people dead and billions in damage and economic losses.On Monday, the northern New South Wales city of Lismore saw its worst flooding in history, leaving people stranded on their rooftops and prompting close to 1,000 rescue calls when fast-rising floodwaters engulfed homes.“This is a natural disaster of unprecedented proportions,” Stephanie Cooke, the state’s minister for emergency services, said.Australia has been hit with a series of extreme climate events over the past few years, including the 2019-2020 wildfires, drought and now historic floods.“Unfortunately, periods of intense rainfall are becoming more powerful as climate change accelerates. We need urgent, deep emissions cuts this decade to limit warming any further. Every fraction of a degree counts,” the Australian Climate Council said Sunday.The country’s conservative government has been resistant to strong action against climate change and refuses to commit to phasing out coal power."}, {"title": "Detroit Zoo Moves Birds Inside Over Avian Flu Outbreak In Michigan", "text": "The Detroit Zoo will be moving most of its birds inside, away from public view, in response to a highly contagious and deadly strain of avian flu identified in Michigan this week.“This is an important preventative measure,” Dr. Ann Duncan, the zoo’s director of animal health, said in a statement. “By bringing these animals indoors, we can more closely monitor them and prevent contact with wild birds who may be carriers of [highly pathogenic avian influenza].”The birds being sequestered include flamingos, the more than 20 species living inside the zoo’s “free-flight” aviary, and the peacocks that normally roam the grounds freely. For now, those animals will be housed inside the areas they typically go into to stay warm, Duncan told The Detroit Free Press.One kind of bird that visitors will still be able to see are the penguins, since their living area has its own “air handling system,” the zoo noted.Highly pathogenic avian flu has now been identified in seven states over the past month, including on commercial poultry farms, in backyard flocks of chickens and in wild ducks. Turkey farmers have reported birds dying within hours of apparently becoming infected, according to The New York Times.The United States Department of Agriculture announced on Thursday it had been found in non-commercial and non-poultry flocks of backyard birds Kalamazoo County, Michigan. Those birds were killed “to prevent the spread of disease,” the USDA said.Scientists believe that wild birds may be spreading the illness as they migrate across the country. At the same time, large industrial farms, where thousands of animals are packed into contained spaces, provide the perfect conditions for viruses to run rampant.This strain of bird flu has not jumped to humans and is not considered a risk to human health, though scientists fear the possibility of it mutating."}, {"title": "'My Octopus Teacher' Was Mesmerizing But There's 1 Thing That Deeply Troubled Me", "text": "Recently, Jacinta Shackleton, a marine biologist stationed at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, recorded a blanket octopus (the first one was spotted 21 years ago) while snorkeling. I was excited to see photos of the incredibly elusive creature, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what would have happened if someone who watched “My Octopus Teacher,” last year’s well-deserved Oscar-winning documentary, had discovered it. Would they have approached and tried to touch it?When I watched “My Octopus Teacher,” about South African filmmaker and conservationist Craig Foster’s yearlong underwater interactions with an octopus, I was mesmerized by the fantastic footage. As a certified dive master and science teacher, however, I am concerned by the message viewers might take away from the film: that anyone can strap on weights, descend deep, and start touching creatures underwater.I have logged hundreds of underwater hours and I know how rare it is to see an octopus or any other nocturnal sea creature during the day with good enough light to film, let alone see one leave its crevasse and move about freely. Such an experience is certainly worthy of capturing on camera. But as a teacher and human being concerned about our planet, I felt worried.I fell in love with scuba diving when I was in my 20s and I want as many people as possible to experience the thrill of breathing underwater and witnessing creatures that seem like they could only exist in science fiction. However, I also want people to make good choices.Foster claims that he was swimming alone while filming, but it appears to me that he had help. If he was alone, that worries me, as freediving like scuba diving is exponentially riskier when done solo.While wearing weights and diving without training or a partner is dangerous, touching the creatures you encounter is even worse. Dive masters are constantly telling people: “Take only photos, leave only bubbles.” My concern is that most people walk away from watching this masterful film with a renewed desire for closeness with nature, but without a sense of what is appropriate for connection with wild animals.In 1963, the Bronx Zoo had an exhibit called “the Most Dangerous Animal in the World,” and it featured just a mirror. The implication was that human beings can be (and often are) dangerous to the world around them, to each other, and to themselves. We can certainly see this play out underwater.During one of my many dives in Cozumel, a diver was antagonizing a barracuda. We never dove with him again. His behavior was unsafe for him, for the fish and for all of us around him. If you touch a rockfish, stonefish or lionfish, you may come in contact with their venomous quills or spines, and you can be poisoned. If you accidentally scrape your leg or arm on coral, you may get coral stuck in the wound, and some types of coral are toxic. What’s more, coral is fragile, and touching or standing on it can kill it (unfortunately coral reefs are currently facing many human-caused threats). I have seen people stick their camera and fingers into a coral head or small cave to get a better photo of an eel. If an eel bites you, it cannot release its second set of jaws, called the pharyngeal jaws. Someone will have to kill the eel to remove it from you.On the street or the beach, if someone’s dog runs up to you, you ask the owner if their pet is friendly. You ask for permission to approach or touch. When I was walking in the Canadian wilderness with tour operator Churchill Wild to see wolves and polar bears, there was a 9-year-old in our group. At one point, he crouched down ― something we had been given specific instructions not to do ― and the wolf closest to us immediately turned toward him. All of the adults quickly moved in front of the child and he stood up. Thankfully, nothing happened to him. It was a frightening and powerful reminder that when we are out of our normal habitat, we humans may not understand ― and therefore abide by ― all the rules, even if we think we know them.Sometimes humans and wildlife merge and evolve together in unexpected ways. Years ago, many people who fish in Grand Cayman began to clean their catch in one spot and the stingrays around the island came for the free lunch. Now, the area is known as Stingray City, a tourist destination where people can see and swim with many stingrays in one place.A similar thing happened in Oslob, Cebu, in the Philippines, where the whale sharks were following the fishing boats. People on the boats threw krill in the direction of the sharks and someone saw it on YouTube. Then the tourists came. When I was there, a marine biologist gave us instructions to stay 9 feet from the school bus-sized creatures. However, no one gave this memo to the whale sharks. When humans and wildlife come together ― no matter how beautiful or exciting it may seem ― we still need to remember that these creatures are wild and that we need to respect that, so we don’t hurt them or their habitat (and so we don’t get hurt, either).Our natural world needs our help. While I believe “My Octopus Teacher” has brought the wonder of the oceans and their creatures to millions of people, I am still troubled by the promotion of the idea that it’s safe to enter the private world of another creature (especially by yourself) and touch it without consent. I’m not claiming that Foster is or ever would suggest that anyone do what he did, but impressionable viewers may not be able to separate his actions from their own, and that could be trouble for everyone involved.Foster makes clear that his connection with the octopus heals him, and after months of staying at home due to COVID, most of us are searching to renew our relationships with ourselves, each other, and the natural world. But we need to do this with care and caution. We need to put the well-being of these creatures before our own desires. And we need to remember that what happens in a movie ― even a documentary ― isn’t permission to do it ourselves.I hope that everyone who loved this film will find a way to care for our planet’s ocean environments by supporting the establishment of more marine protected areas, reducing plastic, picking up trash, and being kind to the incredible marine animals and environments we might encounter. Sometimes the best way to be kind to them is to leave them alone ― to be satisfied with the gift of a glimpse of their beauty and nothing more.As Shackleton recently reminded us, there are many creatures still being discovered and nearly 80% of our underwater world is yet unmapped. I hope this recent sighting of the blanket octopus and “My Octopus Teacher” inspires many others to explore. There are terrific adventures to be found all over our planet, but we need to participate in ways that keep both us and the creatures we encounter safe from harm.Lisa Ellen Niver is an award-winning travel expert who has explored 101 countries and six continents.

The largest tract of more than 125,000 acres sold to Bight Wind Holdings, LLC for $1.1 billion.The renewable energy auction dwarfs recent offshore oil and gas lease sales, including one in November when 33 companies paid a total of $191 million for rights to drill for fossil fuels across more than 1.7 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico. A federal judge has since vacated those leases, concluding that the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate effects when it held its massive auction.The Interior Department estimates that the areas auctioned off in New York Bight have the potential to support wind farms that power up to 2 million homes.Ali Zaidi, deputy White House national climate adviser, called the wind lease sale “a big step towards cleaner electricity and a stronger domestic energy sector.”“President Biden has long seen the opportunity embedded in taking on the climate crisis ― and we are chasing after that opportunity,” he said in a statement. “We have the chance to breathe life into idled ports, revitalize our industrial base, and build products here in America to harness the wind and sun.”"}, {"title": "Oil-Backed Republicans Blame Biden’s Energy Policies For Russian Invasion", "text": "Republicans, including some of the biggest recipients of fossil fuel campaign donations, are blaming Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on President Joe Biden’s energy policies, citing the crisis to justify more oil and gas drilling at home.In an interview Thursday with right-wing news outlet Newsmax, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said Putin and other world leaders have “watched Joe Biden as he’s made decisions like stopping the Keystone [XL pipeline], ending drilling on federal lands — things that really hindered the U.S.”“Vladimir Putin said, ‘Joe Biden is weak. I am going to move forward,’” said Blackburn, who has received more than $800,000 in oil and gas industry donations over her career.Putting aside that the senator’s comments sound like someone with a direct line to the war-hungry Russian president, there is nothing to indicate that Biden’s energy agenda — specifically, revoking a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline or pausing new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters — motivated Putin to attack Ukraine.Beyond that, any claim that Biden has “ended” federal fossil fuel drilling in the U.S. is simply false. The administration recently paused new federal leasing and permitting in response to a Trump-appointed judge’s ruling that blocked the administration from using a higher calculation for the damages associated with planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.Republicans have embraced the talking points as part of a broader partisan effort to place the responsibility for Russia’s attack at Biden’s feet. That effort has primarily consisted of vague attacks painting Biden as “weak” and ignored actions the administration has taken to try to ease soaring energy costs, including appealing to both U.S. drillers and other oil-rich nations to increase production. He’s also signaled that he’s considering releasing more oil from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve and temporarily suspending the federal gas tax.Biden “shuts down American energy production” — he hasn’t done that — “and greenlights Russian energy production,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said during a speech Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Orlando, Florida. “Is it any wonder that Vladamir Putin feels emboldened to do whatever the heck it is he wants to do?”Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), the ranking minority member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told The Hill that for America to maintain its status as a diplomatic and military power, it has to be a fossil-fuel-producing economic power.“It’s all connected,” she said, “and President Joe Biden is undermining it all with his radical agenda to shut down American energy and embolden our enemies like Russia.”In a series of Tweets, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) argued that Putin was “empowered and emboldened by Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and his approval of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline while killing America’s Keystone XL pipeline.”The White House maintains that Biden has always opposed Nord Stream 2, an $11 billion pipeline that runs between Russia and Germany but is not yet operational. But last year he waived sanctions against the company behind the project, citing a desire not to negatively impact ally Germany. The administration reversed course earlier this week in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, sanctioning both the company, named Nord Stream 2 AG, and its corporate executives.Hawley, McMorris Rodgers and Daines have received $289,000, $767,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, from the oil and gas industry over their careers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics data.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) offered the most conspiratorial interpretation of the ongoing conflict, suggesting that Biden sparked the war intentionally via his energy and climate policies.“It feels planned to me,” she told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.The same Republicans are using the crisis to push for more domestic oil and gas production, though that would do little, if anything, to deter Russia’s attack on Ukraine or provide immediate relief at the pump.In a video posted to Twitter, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) called on the White House and Congress to “immediately unleash our full energy production capabilities” and increase exports of liquified natural gas. The fossil fuel industry is a top-five contributor of Boebert’s, and oil and gas company Terra Energy pays Boebert’s husband nearly half a million dollars per year.As Russia launched its war on Thursday, Noem posted a list of six actions that argued “a strong American President” would immediately take. Five of them targeted boosting domestic fossil fuel production and negatively impacting Russia’s energy sector.The list mirrors one that the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s largest trade association, posted to its Twitter profile Wednesday.White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked during a press conference Thursday whether Biden would consider lifting restrictions on domestic energy production or review his decision on Keystone XL in light of the Ukraine crisis.“First of all, the Keystone Pipeline is not flowing, so I’m not sure how that would solve anything,” Psaki said. “There’s also plenty of oil leases that are not being tapped into by oil companies, so you should talk to them about that and why.”Biden has acknowledged that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could impact the U.S. economy and stressed that U.S. fossil fuel producers “should not ― should not ― exploit this moment to heighten their prices to raise profits.”“I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting,” Biden said during a Thursday press conference. “I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Kristi Noem as the governor of North Dakota. She is the governor of South Dakota."}, {"title": "500-Pound Bear 'Hank The Tank' Gets Reprieve Following New DNA Evidence", "text": "A 500-pound black bear accused of breaking into 28 homes in South Lake Tahoe, California, was wrongfully implicated in at least some of the incidents.New DNA evidence shows that the bear, who has become widely known as “Hank the Tank,” is just one of multiple food-seeking bears involved in break-ins in the wealthy neighborhood of Tahoe Keys.“While recent incidents of bears invading homes were originally thought to be a single bear, DNA evidence collected from the most recent incident as well as prior incidents over the past several months prove that at least three bears were responsible for breaking into numerous residences,” the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement.Previously, officials were trying to catch Hank and were considering relocating or even killing him, a move the department previously told HuffPost would be a “last resort.” The possibility of Hank’s execution drew backlash both locally ― most notably from local bear advocacy group BEAR League ― and nationally as his fame grew and he gained fans.Now the department is modifying its strategy.“CDFW will work in coming weeks and months to trap bears in the South Lake Tahoe area, tag them, collect evidence for genetic analysis, and then release them into suitable habitat,” the department said.The statement added, “CDFW is not going to euthanize any bears that are trapped during this effort.”The department also urged people in the area to take more precautions when dealing with food and trash, noting that “improperly stored human food and trash are likely attracting bears into this neighborhood.”The BEAR League celebrated the news, speculating on social media that Hank had been “taking the rap” for all the break-ins, “probably due to his size” and “extreme handsomeness.”However, The Sacramento Bee reported that there’s still a possibility that one or more bears in the area ― including Hank ― could wind up dead. That’s because in California, homeowners who have had bear trouble can request a permit for a bear trap on their property. If the trap catches a bear and DNA evidence shows it’s the same bear that caused damage the first time, the bear could be killed."}, {"title": "‘Baby Boot Camp’ Exercises Critically Endangered Orangutan", "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The 2-month-old critically endangered orangutan, still so tiny that infant-sized diapers hung loosely in front of his belly, clung tightly to a caretaker’s fingers as she lifted him gently from her lap.Roux, born Christmas Eve 2021, needs to get strong enough to hold onto his mother 24 hours a day ― and 12-year-old Menari is the “wild child” of the Audubon Zoo’s orangutans, said Kelsey Forbes, the assistant curator of primates.“She is our biggest acrobat — a little bit crazy,” Forbes said Tuesday.So every day, Roux gets multiple sessions of “baby boot camp” including pullups to strengthen his grip and arms.The zoo’s Sumatran orangutans, like the other two orangutan species, are considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Illegal hunting and loss and fragmentation of the forests where they live are major reasons that their numbers are falling in the wild.So Roux is an important baby.He and his two half-sisters — Madu, born Feb. 28, 2021, and Bulan, born in July 2019 — make up one-third of all orangutans born since the start of 2019 as part of the Orangutan Species Survival Program.Three were born in 2019, one in 2020, three in 2021 and two so far this year, program spokesperson Angela Selzer said Thursday. One other baby, born this year at the San Diego Zoo, was a Sumatran orangutan; the other five were Bornean.It’s the caretakers who do most of the pulling for Roux, lifting him up and down as he grips their thumbs or fingers. But Roux also sometimes pulls himself up as he hangs between their hands.Strength isn’t the only thing he needs to be reunited with Menari, Forbes and curator Liz Wilson said Tuesday.He’s drinking 80 to 90 milliliters (2.7 to 3 ounces) of formula every 3.5 hours.Caretakers want to reduce the number of night feedings, Forbes said. “Orangutans are primarily sleeping from sundown to sunrise. We want to be able to mimic that as much as possible,” she said.And there’s another bit of training, in case Menari, a first-time mother, isn’t producing enough milk — the problem that left her baby so weak he needed constant medical care for a month. He needs to be able to drink an entire bottle poked through the den’s mesh.When he was first taken from Menari, Roux — who wasn’t yet named — couldn’t even suckle, said Forbes. He was fed through a skinny tube inserted through his nose to his stomach, and his caretakers’ duties included making sure he didn’t pick or pull at it.An expert from Children’s Hospital New Orleans taught the staff “tricks and tips” that included massaging the baby’s palate and gums before each feeding, Forbes said.“He took to it fantastically,” Forbes said.His weight rose from 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) to 5.6 pounds (2.54 kilograms) as of Thursday. Though a full-term baby, he started a bit underweight, possibly because he was a twin, Forbes said Thursday. The other baby was stillborn.He spends much of the day with a caretaker in indoor areas, including a den bedroom, where the older animals can see him but not get close. They come in from their big outdoor yard to watch, Forbes said.“They like it when he makes noises. They like during diaper changes. They really like it during feedings,” she said.In the den, he gets to crawl around on various sizes of fire hose and other objects.When the zoo is closed, he gets taken on walks around the zoo, including power-walking and abrupt turns to get him hanging tight.The baby was named this month. His name, pronounced “roo,” is French for reddish brown, the color of an orangutan’s long hair, and for the cooked mixture of flour and oil or butter used to thicken gumbo and other foods.His father, Jambi, sired all three of Audubon’s youngsters since coming to New Orleans in 2018 from Hannover, Germany.Bulan, whose mother is the same as Menari’s, constantly follows her half-sister, who plays with her.Forbes says caretakers don’t expect jealousy to be a problem when Roux and his mother are together.“Not at all! We think that Bulan will be excited to have another playmate. Same with Madu!” she said Thursday."}, {"title": "Russia May Be A ‘Big Gas Station,’ But It’s Also A Key Supplier For Clean Energy", "text": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could delay the global shift away from fossil fuels, analysts said Thursday, a perhaps counterintuitive impact of what’s likely to be the largest land war in Europe since World War II.Earlier this week, Harvard economist Jason Furman, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, dismissed Russia to The New York Times as “basically a big gas station,” saying the country was “incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas.” Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental group 350.org, said in a tweet on Tuesday that “Russia can only afford to fight because of its oil and gas… so it might be wise to stop using oil and gas now.”But analysts say even if the world magically moved away from fossil fuels, Russia would still remain a big player in the global energy supply chain. That’s because, as E&E News mining reporter Jael Holzman first noted, Russia is a major source of key metals that batteries and clean electricity depend on, such as nickel and aluminum, as well as a top exporter of nuclear reactor technology.“Initially, this could slow the energy transition,” said Julian Kettle, an analyst and senior vice president at the British energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.“We can’t pull metal out of the ground fast enough” to produce the renewables needed to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, he added.Russia produces roughly 7% of the world’s mined nickel. However, it generates 20% of the global supply of Class 1 nickel, the grade of the metal most commonly used in lithium-ion batteries to increase how much energy they hold and how long they stay charged.When nickel prices rose about 21% last year, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of the electric auto and battery giant Tesla, called nickel supplies “our biggest concern for scaling” battery production. While electric vehicle sales spiked by more than 80% last year, a “minuscule” number of those cars were powered by no-nickel batteries.On Thursday, the price of nickel climbed to more than $25,000 per ton, the highest it’s been since 2011.“Any sanction leading to an export ban would likely have further impact on the nickel price, which is already at decadelong highs,” said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a London-based research firm that specializes in lithium-ion batteries.Even after the West sanctioned key Russian industries following the invasion of Crimea in 2014, metal producers largely avoided such penalties. There was one notable exception: the aluminum maker Rusal, which the United States sanctioned in 2018 in a bid to punish its billionaire founder, Oleg Deripaska, in connection with Crimea and various other fights with Russia.The sanctions, which were lifted in 2019 when Deripaska relinquished control of the firm, sent the price of aluminum up 35% in a matter of days, according to Reuters.Today Russia supplies around 6% of the world’s aluminum, the price of which shot up to a record high of $3,450 per ton on the London Metal Exchange on Thursday.Far more than just the main source of the kitchen foil mainstay, aluminum is so key to building solar panels that a January study in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Sustainability found that solar energy, at its current rate of growth, could eat up half the world’s supply of the metal by 2050. It’s also used to make the high-voltage power lines needed to carry solar and wind energy from where it’s available to where it’s needed.One problem with aluminum is that it normally requires large amounts of fossil fuels to smelt. But even there Russia has an advantage as companies like the Anglo-Russian En+ Group, which has ties to Rusal, build low-carbon smelters in Siberia that use hydropower made increasingly abundant through melting ice.And sanctions, particularly for metals, are not necessarily effective because Russia could redirect its sales to China, which is importing metals to fund its energy transition and could process the raw materials and sell them to buyers in the very countries in the West seeking to limit Russia’s access to markets as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine.Even nuclear energy — the zero-carbon electricity source that skeptics of renewable energy favor — is a key asset for Russia. The nation’s state-owned nuclear company Rosatom became the world’s leading supplier of reactors in 2017, cutting deals to build new plants in countries such as Bangladesh, China and Egypt. ​​Russia also produces about 2% of the world’s cobalt, the metal used in various battery chemistries, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and Russian mercenaries have played a notable role in developing mining supply chains in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the world’s supply comes from.China still enjoys a near-monopoly on the production of rare earth minerals, a group of 17 metals with unique magnetic properties that make them crucial for making batteries and other electronics. But Russia boasts the fourth-largest known reserves of these minerals. In August 2020, the country announced plans to invest $1.5 billion into boosting the production of rare earth minerals, with an aim of becoming the No. 2 supplier after China by the end of this decade.The Biden administration is seeking to counter its geopolitical rivals’ dominance in the clean energy supply chain. China’s control over flows of lithium and rare earths in particular has become a sticking point that pro-fossil fuel opponents of decarbonization policy have used to argue that reducing use of oil, gas and coal poses risks to the United States’ national security.On Tuesday, the White House announced plans to invest $35 million in the United States’ lone rare earths producer, the California-based miner MP Materials, as part of a plan to increase domestic output of metals needed for decarbonization.“China controls most of the global market in these minerals,” President Joe Biden said in a speech Tuesday. “We can’t build a future that’s made in America if we ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power the products of today and tomorrow.”The same could be said of Russia, if to a lesser degree."}, {"title": "UN: More Wildfires Will Scorch The Planet In Coming Decades And Nations Are Not Prepared", "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A warming planet and changes to land use patterns mean more wildfires will scorch large parts of the globe in coming decades, causing spikes in unhealthy smoke pollution and other problems that governments are ill prepared to confront, according to a U.N. report being released Wednesday.The western U.S., northern Siberia, central India, and eastern Australia already are seeing more blazes, and the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires globally could increase more than 50% by the turn of the century, according to the report from the U.N. Environment Program.Areas once considered safe from major fires won’t be immune, including the Arctic, which the report said was “very likely to experience a significant increase in burning.”Tropical forests in Indonesia and the southern Amazon of South America also are likely to see increased wildfires, the report concluded.“Uncontrollable and devastating wildfires are becoming an expected part of the seasonal calendars in many parts of the world,” said Andrew Sullivan, with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia, one of the report’s authors.But U.N. researchers said many nations continue to spend too much time and money fighting fires and not enough trying to prevent them. Land use changes can make the fires worse, such as logging that leaves behind debris that can easily burn and forests that are intentionally ignited to clear land for farming, the report said.In the United States, officials recently unveiled a $50 billion effort to reduce fire risks over the next decade by more aggressively thinning forests around “hot spots” where nature and neighborhoods collide. However, the administration of President Joe Biden has so far identified only a fraction of the funding called for in the plan.The U.N. researchers also called for more awareness of the dangers from smoke inhalation, which can affect tens of millions of people annually as plumes from major wildfires drift thousands of miles across international borders."}, {"title": "'The Birds Outsmarted Us': Magpies Work Together To Give Scientists The Slip", "text": "Anyone who’s ever been swooped at by a magpie will be horrified to learn that the birds are working together.A research team in Australia studying a new kind of tracking device for birds was surprised to find that magpies were cooperating to give them the slip.“When we attached tiny, backpack-like tracking devices to five Australian magpies for a pilot study, we didn’t expect to discover an entirely new social behaviour rarely seen in birds,” wrote Dominique Potvin, an animal ecologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast, in an article for The Conversation.“Our goal was to learn more about the movement and social dynamics of these highly intelligent birds, and to test these new, durable and reusable devices. Instead, the birds outsmarted us.”Magpies are a staple in Australian bush and backyards. The iconic birds are known for their warbling calls and territorial but playful nature. Most Aussies ― especially cyclists and runners ― will likely have had some kind of experience with a swooping magpie in their lifetime, as many harrowing but hilarious viral videos have shown.According to Potvin’s research paper, after scientists attached tracking devices to five birds, they began to display what seemed to be altruistic behavior: They would cooperate to help each other remove the trackers. One bird would snap another bird’s harness at the only weak point.They appeared to be helping one another without getting any immediate, tangible reward, Potvin noted, demonstrating both cooperation and problem solving.So it’s back to the drawing board for the team, which needs to find a more effective way of collecting data about the birds.Read more at The Conversation."}, {"title": "Raw Sewage Spill Shuts Down Beaches In Southern California", "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.

That figure was $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted under President Barack Obama, but slashed to just $7 per ton under President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden reinstated the $51 metric when he took office and said the administration would update it further as climate change continues.The figure, as The New York Times notes, is used to guide government decisions on pollution-linked industries, and a higher dollar value in the future could make it harder for new oil and gas projects to move forward. Scientists have long said that fossil fuel emissions need to be drastically reduced as soon as possible to limit the negative effects of climate change, which already cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars a year.A coalition of 10 GOP attorneys general sued the Biden administration after it reverted to the original figure, however, saying the metric unduly targets energy-producing states. A Trump-appointed judge agreed earlier this month, blocking the White House from using the higher cost estimate while saying the $51 figure would “artificially increase the cost estimates of lease sales.”Environmental advocates blasted the ruling as basically a defanging of the nation’s climate policies, and the Department of Justice said it would appeal the decision while it indefinitely paused the rollout of new oil and gas permits.“From President [Richard] Nixon on, every President has imposed some internal Executive Branch requirement for federal agencies to assess the costs and benefits of major government actions,” the DOJ said in a court filing this weekend. “The injunction further calls into question the authority of the past three Administrations to provide standardized guidance to agencies on appropriate methods of estimating the social cost of greenhouse-gas emissions.”The legal jostling is the latest in an ongoing battle between Biden and GOP efforts to limit his climate policies. The president suspended new federal oil and gas leases when he entered the White House and Republican states sued after that move, too. Biden was forced by a federal judge to allow the lease sale to go forward, the largest in U.S. history.Environmentalists said the sale was a ticking “carbon bomb,” but a judge canceled the leases last month, saying the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate impacts when it held the auction.The latest ruling over the social cost of carbon calculation seems to have had a similar effect, at least for now, with the Biden administration saying any new oil and gas permits would be halted as the DOJ assesses “whether and how they can proceed.”The Times notes that the decision has already had an impact in Wyoming, which had hoped to have a lease sale for drilling that could have brought millions of dollars in revenue to the state’s coffers. That sale, for now, won’t go forward as planned.Wyoming was one of the states that filed suit against the metric."}, {"title": "Led Zeppelin Co-founder Leads Stunning New Take On 'When The Levee Breaks'", "text": "Playing for Change just dropped its latest global musical effort, a fresh new take on “When The Levee Breaks” anchored by Led Zeppelin bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones.The song ― originally recorded by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie nearly a century ago to commemorate the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 ― was the closing track of Zeppelin’s untitled 1971 album, aka “Led Zeppelin IV.”Along with Jones, the new version features Stephen Perkins of Jane’s Addiction, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, along with more than a dozen musicians from seven nations playing remotely:“Looking at ‘When The Levee Breaks’ through the lens of producing a song to raise awareness for key environmental organizations truly felt like a plea for climate justice,” Sebastian Robertson, who plays on the track and co-produced it, told Rolling Stone. “The wailing guitars, harmonica, and vocals all in harmony for Mother Earth.”Playing for Change said proceeds will benefit organizations that promote environmental justice and sustainability including Conservation International, American Rivers, World Wildlife Fund, REVERB and the Playing for Change Foundation.“It seems that little has changed since 1927, or even 2005 with Katrina.

At least three bears have been breaking into homes, prompting the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to modify its strategy. Read more here.Earlier:A 500-pound black bear has broken into 28 homes and caused significant property damage in a California city, eluding wildlife officials for months.A “special trapping effort” is now underway to catch the hefty male, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife announced this week. Since summer 2021, the bear has “forcefully entered” houses and caused “extensive property damage” around Tahoe Keys, a wealthy neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe. The bear’s “immense size and strength” make it easy for him to get through both front doors and garage doors, the statement said.There have been more than 150 calls to authorities placed over the bear, according to local news station KCRA.Following reports the bear would be killed if caught, California DFW spokesperson Peter Tira told HuffPost that officials were looking at multiple options and that the bear’s death would a “last resort.”“With regard to when and if it is captured, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife is exploring all options, which include placement in an accredited sanctuary or similar facility, relocation and euthanasia, which is always the option of last resort,” Tira said in an email.The bear has many aliases. SFGate reports that residents of Tahoe Keys know him as Jake or Yogi. Local police, however, have taken to calling him “Hank the Tank.”Whatever name you call him, though, the bear is “severely food-habituated,” which means he no longer fears humans and instead associates people with food. This can happen when people either intentionally feed bears, or accidentally leave food out where bears can eat it.Most of the incidents happened in the spring and summer of year, when the bear was in hyperphagia ― a state of constant eating that prepares bears for hibernation, Tira told CNN.

Named Storm Eunice by the British and Irish weather services, and Storm Zeynep in Germany, Friday’s storm was the second to hit the region in a week.Winds toppled the spire of a church in Wells, southwest England, ripped off parts of the domed roof of London’s O2 Arena and left a trail of felled trees and damaged buildings across several countries.A gust of 122 miles an hour (196 kilometers an hour) was provisionally recorded Friday on the Isle of Wight.

The role was created after the Great Recession to guard against future financial meltdowns, and though the financial industry largely welcomed the nomination of a seasoned and familiar regulator who previously served as deputy treasury secretary and on the Fed’s board of governors, it’s the oil and gas industry that’s fueling the Republican assault.Raskin, who is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), entered the industry’s crosshairs in March 2020, when, in testimony before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, she called for new federal rules requiring investors to disclose the risk that climate change poses to assets. She then urged U.S. regulators to carry out the kind of climate “stress tests” ― models to determine how a financial institution’s assets gain or lose value if, for example, a natural disaster upends supply chains or a government policy to cut emissions renders fossil fuel reserves worthless ― that the Bank of England and European Central Bank were already performing.Two months later, she argued in a New York Times opinion piece that the money the Fed was spending to prop up fossil fuel companies amid the pandemic “not only misdirects limited recovery resources but also sends a false price signal to investors about where capital needs to be allocated.”She effectively argued for taking a U-turn on the Trump-era policy. Instead of favoring fossil fuel companies in loans from the Fed, boost energy companies that decarbonize their operations.“Her views are in the mainstream,” said Steven Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, a program under the Ceres green investor advocacy group. “There are over 100 central banks around the world that are part of the Network for Greening the Financial System. They’re all saying climate is a risk. Our current chair of the Federal Reserve says climate is a risk.”Yet while Fed chair Jerome Powell’s statements acknowledge climate change’s financial risks, he has yet to propose any corrective measures as specific as those Raskin has put forward.Climate-concerned progressives lauded her and urged President Joe Biden to name her treasury secretary or, at the very least, as the Treasury Department’s climate czar. But when the White House ultimately named her to the Fed role in January, the industry that stood to suffer the most from the policies she had floated now targeted her as an opponent.Raskin could not implement policy unilaterally as one member of the Fed’s board of governors. In a speech to a conference last summer, she also tempered expectations about what kinds of policies could even work in the U.S., telling a European interviewer that requiring climate-vulnerable companies to keep certain amounts of capital on hand at all times is a concept that “does not have much traction on this side of the pond.”Still, shortly after her nomination last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which for years denied the very reality of climate change, offered a rare rebuke of a Fed nominee, warning in a public letter that Raskin might “direct capital away from certain industries that are politically disfavored or direct capital towards industries that are politically favored.”The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s biggest lobby in the U.S., echoed the sentiment.“We remain concerned about Sarah Bloom Raskin’s past statements regarding the oil and natural gas industry,” Frank Macchiarola, API’s senior vice president of policy and regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement. “We believe it would be inappropriate to use the Federal Reserve as a mechanism to restrict capital to our sector which could ultimately undermine efforts to deliver affordable and reliable energy while addressing the climate challenge.”The American Energy Alliance, a fossil fuel advocacy group funded by the petrochemical billionaire Charles Koch, accused Raskin of singling out the oil and gas industry because it was “unwoke.”A HuffPost analysis of campaign donation data found that the dozen Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee received more than $8.3 million in combined donations from the oil and gas industry, with an average of nearly $697,000. The senators are Pat Toomey (Pa.), Richard Shelby (Ala.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Tim Scott (S.C.), Mike Rounds (S.D.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), John Kennedy (La.), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Steve Daines (Mont.).The 10 additional senators who signed the letter to the White House include some of the other biggest recipients of oil donations, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.). In the letter, they say that confirming Raskin risked the “potential abuse of power to inflict harm upon the traditional fuel industry.”In a letter of its own, the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Better Markets accused the Republican senators of having “misleadingly cherry-picked and distorted” Raskin’s record.“Ms. Raskin’s actual statements and views on climate align with Fed Chair Powell, former Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randy Quarles, the biggest banks on Wall Street, financial industry leaders, and others,” Dennis Kelleher, Better Markets’ co-founder and president, said in a statement. “While these ideological and, at times, apparently poll-driven political attacks may play well with some base voters, they have no place in what should be a fact-based confirmation process.”The White House declined a HuffPost request to interview Raskin.The oil and gas industry and its legislative allies have in recent years begun parroting the language that social justice activists use to describe discrimination or access to health care.As a growing number of cities require new buildings to install electric appliances and boiler systems, nearly two dozen states have prohibited their municipalities from banning natural gas use for cooking and heating, casting the legislation as protecting consumer choice. Meanwhile, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the right-wing policy shop, in the past year started promoting model bills to state lawmakers banning “discrimination” against fossil fuel companies by requiring state comptrollers and treasurers to withdraw government funds from banks, insurance firms and investment companies that do not invest in fossil fuels.The push coincides with mounting warnings that continued investment in fossil fuel infrastructure could create a dangerous financial bubble.In October, the Financial Stability Oversight Council ― the federal entity established as part of the same post-recession Dodd-Frank Act reforms that created the position to which Raskin was nominated ― issued a landmark report on climate change. The document found that global warming poses financial threats on numerous fronts, and, perhaps most jarringly, that the United States’ growing dependence on natural gas for electricity and heat could represent one of the nation’s biggest vulnerabilities.The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco warned a year ago that climate change “will result in economic and financial losses for many businesses, households, and governments” and said “the uncertainty about the severity and timing of these losses” was a risk unto itself.In January 2020, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, wrote in its annual letter to CEOs that it would be “increasingly disposed to vote against management and board directors when companies are not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures.” That July, Citigroup pledged to start measuring companies by their compatibility with the warming scenario outlined in the Paris climate accords. JPMorgan Chase made a similar commitment that October.Raskin’s views on climate are central to the opposition against her. But Toomey, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, accused her of lobbying the Kansas City Fed branch on behalf of a financial tech firm whose board she briefly joined months after leaving the Treasury Department in 2017. The Wall Street Journal editorial board called it evidence of a corrupt “revolving door” deal in which the tech firm, Reserve Trust, hired Raskin to do its bidding.But the story, which Toomey cited to the Kansas City Fed leadership, was quickly disputed. Colorado’s state bank regulator said the Fed branch “misrepresented” the facts of what happened, explaining that Reserve Trust’s successful appeal to be considered a bank by the Fed came after the company changed its business model and won approval from state regulators, not as a result of Raskin’s influence. Reserve Trust’s co-founder wrote in a letter to the editor published in the Journal that Raskin “had no role whatsoever” in gaining the company’s Fed approval.Raskin and other Fed nominees have pledged to wait four years before taking any job with a company that provides financial services.Advocates called the whole “scandal” a sideshow to pad the climate-fueled criticism of Raskin. They also said there was a double standard at play just months after the vice chair and two regional Fed leaders were implicated in an actual ethics scandal in which officials working on the Fed’s pandemic bailout programs traded stocks that benefited from those very policies. The move prompted new ethics rules, unveiled this week.“We are, of course, concerned that Raskin was involved in all-too-common revolving-door work on behalf of a fintech firm,” said Jeff Hauser, founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s Revolving Door Project. “But after Republicans have ignored a historic Fed scandal… it’s hard to get too worked up about it.”"}, {"title": "Mistakes Tourists Make At National Parks", "text": "Two of the biggest effects of the pandemic on travel have been the emphasis on domestic tourism and the increased interest in outdoor adventures. When you combine those in the U.S., what you get is a newfound appreciation for the stunning national parks.In 2021, the National Parks System reported nearly 300 million recreation visits across all properties, and 44 parks set new visitation records. These high numbers include many first-time parkgoers, who don’t always know how to take advantage of all these stunning destinations have to offer. In fact, many seasoned national park travelers don’t hesitate to point out some of the faux pas they’ve observed from their fellow visitors.We asked some experts to share some of the biggest mistakes they believe travelers make when they visit national parks. Read on for 11 examples, as well as advice for avoiding these common missteps.“A lot of travelers get caught up in the romanticism of spontaneity,” said Heather Gyselman, a product manager for adventure travel at REI. “I get it, who doesn’t want to hit the road without a care in the world? However, when visiting a national park today it’s important that you’ve invested time in planning and organizing your trip.”If you don’t do any advance planning, you might find yourself scrambling as you encounter daily capacity limits, trail and road closures, limited parking and fully booked campgrounds and lodgings. Go to the official website of the national park you want to visit, so you can find this relevant information ahead of time and keep up to date with any changes. Prepare a basic itinerary.“The No. 1 rule is to have a plan,” said Dan Austin, founder and director of special projects at Austin Adventures. “While you can always adjust on the fly, it’s a good idea to plan out the key places you want to see. Once you have that list, review the layout of the park and the road system as it can take all day to get across many of our parks. Add traffic to the mix and it can really get tricky. Having a plan and mapping out everything you want to see can really help with those challenges.”“Don’t limit yourself to the popular or ‘Instagrammable’ spots,” advised Alan Fyall, the Visit Orlando endowed chair of tourism management and associate dean of academic affairs at the University of Central Florida’s Rosen College of Hospitality Management. “Explore the park. Ask a ranger or campground host what they recommend that could be outside the heavily trafficked areas.”There are countless scenic spots that aren’t packed with photo-snapping crowds. Only focusing on the most popular attractions might also keep you from some truly powerful national park experiences.“Most people don’t get far enough away from the parking lots,” said writer and naturalist Janisse Ray. “They do the canned version of our parks, which means they see iconic sights like Old Faithful blowing in a kind of drive-by viewing, but they don’t experience the sense of place or the incredible, life-altering, deeply meaningful spectacles that occur at smaller scales and slower paces.”She encouraged parkgoers who are physically able to get out of the car and go for long walks to immerse themselves in the wilderness.“Stay a while,” Ray said. “Spend some nights. Prepare for your heart to burst open in a way it can’t if you don’t leave your vehicle.”“If you’re looking for lodging inside the parks, book early as reservation space is at a premium ― this includes campgrounds,” Austin said.Even if you are able to book in-park lodging, that might not be your best option. These accommodations are often more expensive than the hotels or short-term rentals in the surrounding area.“Sure, staying overnight at campgrounds or lodges inside the park is cool. Nature is right outside your tent, RV or hotel room,” said Joe Yogerst, author of “50 States, 500 Campgrounds: Where to Go, When to Go, What to See, What to Do.”“But many parks are surrounded by national and state parks with great campgrounds and small communities with outstanding accommodation,” he added. “That means making day trips into the park, but I find that a small inconvenience compared to not going at all.”“In addition to having a plan, I recommend starting very early in the morning,” Austin said. “You’ll beat the traffic and crowds, and it’s prime time for grabbing photographs and spotting wildlife.”National parks tend to be open 24 hours a day, so take advantage of the flexibility. If you traveled out West from the East Coast for your outdoor adventures, don’t let your internal clock adjust to the time change and wake up early instead.“The early bird gets the solitude,” said Andrea Lankford, author of “Ranger Confidential: Living, Working, and Dying in the National Parks.” “Set the alarm and enjoy the serene hours between sunrise and 10:30 a.m.”“National parks are amazing but wild places, so it is essential to practice basic safety while visiting them,” said Will Pattiz, co-founder of More Than Just Parks. “Every year, people die while vacationing in national parks. This is easily avoided by sticking to trails, checking the weather before going out on a hike, maintaining a safe distance from wildlife and avoiding ledges with steep drop-offs.”Lankford cautioned against what she calls “high-altitude selfies,” pointing to the rise in photography-related deaths over the past decade.“Stay back from the cliff edge, put the phone down, and be here now,” she said.And as beautiful the views can be, drive carefully and be mindful of wildlife, pedestrians, bikers and other cars.“Pay attention when in your car,” said Michael Childers, an associate history professor at Colorado State University specializing in the modern American West and the environment. “It is easy to watch a bison frolic and miss that camper stopped in front of you.”“Resist the temptation to do a lot in a short time frame,” Fyall said. “Doing the ‘Mighty 5’ [in Utah] plus the Grand Canyon in a week is something that people commonly inquire about. You are doing yourself and the parks a disservice in trying to ‘park hop.’”Many breathtaking national parks are in relatively close proximity to each other, so it might feel feasible to knock out a bunch in the same trip. But attempting to do this will make the experience more stressful and rushed.Instead, Fyall suggested narrowing the list down to one or two parks per vacation. That way you can devote the proper amount of time to each one and create a less jam-packed itinerary.“Get a feel of the park,” he said. “Go to the same vistas at different times of day, you’d be surprised at the different experiences you could have. The same can be said for trying to do too much in a day.”It’s also better to be flexible at national parks, which is hard if you have a full and stringent itinerary.“If something catches your eye, go check it out,” Fyall said. “If a trailhead is busy or closed, ask a ranger what else you could do or try that trail a different day or time of day.”“Try visiting the most popular parks in the off-season rather than summer,” Yogerst said. “I actually think Yosemite is more gorgeous in winter snow and my best-ever visit to the Grand Canyon was in October.”If you have to do your national parks travel during the summer, he encouraged checking out less-visited parks like Pinnacles in California, Dry Tortugas in Florida, Canyonlands in Utah, Big Bend in Texas and all of the parks in Alaska.The day of the week can make a difference as well. Avoid busy weekends when possible.“See if you can visit on slower days,” Childers said. “Many of our larger parks are being overrun, so if you can go midweek or in the off season to alleviate the pressure and have a much more enjoyable visit.”“One of the biggest mistakes visitors to national parks make is arriving unprepared,” said Riley Mahoney, creator of the website The Parks Expert. “Not bringing enough water, expecting restaurants or other services, or not wearing appropriate shoes are things I notice often on my travels. I’ve seen visitors at parks like Sequoia or Yosemite in December planning to hike or sled but show up wearing sneakers, or sometimes even flip-flops, when there is a foot of snow on the ground.”She noted that some parks have limited water stations, so visitors need to bring a lot with them. Similarly, there are no places to get food or gas within the boundaries of certain parks, such as Joshua Tree.“Visitors should plan to be self-sufficient and pack their patience,” Mahoney noted.Pay attention to the weather forecast and travel with layers so that you can adjust to any big temperature shifts. Prepare for dips in cell service, and pick up a paper map so you have backup navigation.“Bring water if you are going on a hike,” Childers added. “And check the map before you get too far from the trailhead and find out it is beyond your abilities. Oh, and don’t forget the sunscreen.”“National parks are not petting zoos,” Lankford said. “Give park wildlife some personal space, for your sake and theirs.”Visitors have a responsibility to be respectful of the land and creatures that dwell there, so avoid off-limits areas and make sure not to litter. Clean up after your pets as well and be considerate of where you take them.“I love man’s best friend as much as the next guy, but our furry companions are actually not allowed on many national park trails,” said Jim Pattiz, the other co-founder of More Than Just Parks. “This is because, of course, they can have an extremely detrimental effect on native plants and wildlife. The short of it is your Siberian husky should not be chasing lizards in a federally protected area like Saguaro National Park.”A general rule of thumb is that dogs should only go where cars are allowed to go. Pattiz also noted that the use of drones is also prohibited in national parks.“They disturb visitors as well as the wildlife, and can damage the fragile ecosystems our national parks safeguard for us and future generations to enjoy,” he said.You don’t have to figure out your whole park adventure on your own. National park visitor centers are filled with experts happy to share their advice.“Park staff are incredibly helpful and have great suggestions on things to see, park programs and ideas for how to avoid crowds,” said Will Shafroth, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation.Talk to a ranger, volunteer or campground host about the trails you’re interested in hiking and your ability level. They have a wealth of knowledge to share. You can also check out the informational videos and exhibits at the visitor centers to learn more about the history and geography of the park.“Be adventurous!” Gyselman urged. “Ask a ranger what their favorite hike is or where you can get away from the crowds. Most of the time these areas require a little more effort, but the payoffs are huge.”She also recommended checking out the many Facebook and Instagram groups where people share national park travel tips and ideas.“Many National Parks also have designated social media pages managed by rangers or park administration,” Gyselman explained. “The posts they create are informative but so are the chats that fellow park lovers start in the comments section. I’ve found all sorts of helpful nuggets in those conversations.”“Don’t limit yourself to just the national park,” Fyall said. “Adjacent and adjoining wilderness areas, monuments, national forests and other designations that fall under the National Park Service are often less crowded, and have equally stunning vistas, making for a fantastic experience.”Driving over to a national forest or other nearby site can offer a break from crowds during your outdoor adventure time.“There are 155 national forests in America, many of which are equally as beautiful as the national parks they neighbor and only see a fraction of the visitors,” Will Pattiz said. “For example, try the Flathead National Forest next to Glacier National Park, the Bridger-Teton next to Grand Teton, and the Dixie which borders nearly all of the Utah National Parks.”"}, {"title": "Hard Hat Mysteriously Travels 3,300 Miles From Maine To Norway", "text": "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — A man in Norway discovered a Maine Department of Transportation hard hat more than 3,300 miles (5,310 kilometers) away from its home.Sigbjørn Eide said he was collecting trash earlier this month along Norway’s coast when he came across the white hard hat buried in seaweed. Eide spotted an American flag and a MaineDOT logo on the hard hat, The Boston Globe reported Tuesday.When he got home later that day, Eide said he found out the hat belonged to the Maine Department of Transportation and reached out to the department through social media.Edie told MaineDOT on Feb. 8 that he “was astonished and impressed about the long voyage the small helmet had taken,” the newspaper reported.On Tuesday, MaineDOT posted on Facebook that Eide had found the hat miles away from Maine.“Sigbjørn was on a walk and found a MaineDOT hard hat in a fjord, about 3,300 miles from MaineDOT headquarters,” the department said. “We’re not quite sure how this happened, but we’re glad we have a new pen pal!”"}, {"title": "Sydney Swimmer Killed By Shark, City's First Deadly Attack In Nearly 60 Years", "text": "SYDNEY ― Many of Sydney’s iconic beaches, including the famed Bondi Beach, were closed Thursday after an ocean swimmer was killed by a shark, the first fatal attack in the city in almost six decades, authorities said.The man, who has not been identified, was swimming at the city’s Little Bay, a popular spot for families, on Wednesday afternoon when he was attacked by an unknown species of shark. The animal is thought to be up to 16 feet in length and authorities are still searching for it.Local officials closed a stretch of beaches down the city’s eastern coastline, saying the shark could still pose a threat to the public.“The coast is our community’s backyard,” Dylan Parker, the mayor of Sydney’s Randwick area, said Wednesday. “Little Bay is normally such a calm, beautiful place, enjoyed by families. To lose someone to a shark like this is chilling. We are all in shock.”The swimmer went to the Little Bay area nearly every day, according to local accounts. The New South Wales Ambulance service said he appeared to be wearing a wetsuit while swimming just off the rocks below a fisherman before the shark attacked. The service said human remains had been found in the water, adding that the man died from “catastrophic injuries” despite a quick response from medical services.The last fatal shark attack in Sydney took place in 1963 when a shark bit a 32-year-old woman standing in shallow water about 20 feet offshore. Another person was bitten and injured in 2018 in the Randwick area.Shark attacks are highly covered by the media and cast a major pall over the minds of swimmers and surfers, even though such attacks are a relatively rare occurrence in Australia. The country averages about one fatal shark attack per year, but that number rose in 2020 when there were eight fatal attacks, and 2021, when there were three, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database.“This is their domain and habitat and I think when we all decide to go in the water, we must understand that this is their domain,” Steven Pearce, the head of Surf Life Saving New South Wales told The Sydney Morning Herald. “In saying that, from what happened yesterday, it is shocking, it makes everyone sick just thinking about it and our thoughts and hearts go out so much to the victim’s family and friends.”The New South Wales government said last year it planned to spend $500,000 Australian dollars to help prevent and manage shark attacks in the coming years. Officials said the money would be used for drones that would patrol surf events as well as training for shark-specific first aid."}, {"title": "Watchdog Finds Trump Interior Boss Ryan Zinke Violated Ethics Rules, Misused Office", "text": "Ryan Zinke, Donald Trump’s first scandal-plagued head of the Interior Department, violated ethics rules and misused his office with his ongoing involvement in a real estate project in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, the department’s internal watchdog concluded in a new report.The report from Interior’s Office of Inspector General is yet another scathing rebuke of Zinke’s repeated false claims that internal probes against him were “B.S.” and that he was cleared of all wrongdoing — a drum that he continues to pound as he campaigns for Montana’s new congressional seat.The real estate project, known as 95 Karrow, is financially backed by David Lesar, who was the chairman of oil giant Halliburton at the time. A foundation Zinke started and was president of before resigning to take over Interior ― The Great Northern Veterans Peace Park ― owns a 14-acre lot adjacent to the project site and initially agreed to allow developers to build a parking lot on the foundation’s land. Zinke also had hopes of opening a microbrewery on the site.While in office and after stepping down as the foundation’s president, Zinke stayed in constant contact with project developers and “played an extensive, direct, and substantive role in representing the Foundation during negotiations” on the project, according to the inspector general report.The inspector general concluded Zinke’s actions violated the department ethics agreement that he signed upon being confirmed as secretary. Investigators also concluded that Zinke knowingly provided incorrect and incomplete information when Interior ethics officials questioned him about his involvement, a violation of his duty of candor, and misused his official government position by directing Interior staff to assist him with matters related to the project and the foundation.Investigators, however, did not find that Zinke violated federal conflict-of-interests laws since he did not participate in any Interior matters involving the real estate project. They also did not find that Zinke acted in his official capacity to specifically benefit Halliburton.The inspector general referred its findings to the Justice Department, which last summer declined to prosecute Zinke’s actions, according to the report.“Today’s report shows us yet again that former President Trump’s appointees didn’t view their positions at the highest level of our government as an opportunity to serve our country, but as an opportunity to serve the interests of their personal pocketbooks,” Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement Wednesday. Grijalva is one of three House Democrats who called on the Interior’s internal watchdog to investigate the matter back in 2018.In an email statement, Zinke’s campaign slammed the report as a “political hit job” and claimed investigators “didn’t even bother to talk to Ryan Zinke, staff or anyone else who was supposedly involved in the non-existent ‘negotiations.’”“Only in Biden’s corrupt admin is talking to one’s neighbor about the town’s public meetings and history of the land a sin,” the campaign said.The report was issued by Mark Greenblatt, the Trump-nominated inspector general of the Interior Department.Investigators note in the report that Zinke and his wife, Lola, who took over as the foundation’s president after Zinke’s confirmation, refused multiple requests for an interview. The couple’s unwillingness to cooperate led to the inspector general issuing subpoenas to obtain developers’ phone and email records related to the project.Zinke exchanged more than 60 emails and text messages, participated in up to five phone calls and met in person at least once with 95 Karrow developers while in office, investigators found. Among other things, those communications included discussions and negotiations about specific project design issues and Zinke’s interest in building and running a microbrewery.When media outlets began asking about Zinke’s ongoing involvement with the project, he consulted with project leaders about how to respond. In one particular exchange, Zinke told a developer that an unnamed news organization was “not our friend” and stressed that he’d turned over all decision-making authority to the foundation’s board.Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, said the report “confirmed what we’ve known all along — corruption was rampant in the Trump administration.”“Self-dealing like this was par for the course. Ryan Zinke only got fired because he got caught,” she said in a statement. “It’s unfortunate that Attorney General [Merrick] Garland declined to pursue a criminal case against Secretary Zinke. The IG report makes it clear that Zinke broke the law when he ordered his staff to facilitate a meeting and private tour with the developers, one of whom was a top executive at Halliburton.”Zinke faced at least 18 formal investigations during his tenure as head of the Interior Department, and ultimately resigned from his post in January 2019 under a cloud of scandals. He is now running for Montana’s new congressional seat.On the campaign trail, Zinke has railed against resistance among Interior staff and dismissed investigations into his conduct as politically motivated.“All of them ran their course,” he said of the probes during an August interview on the conservative podcast “Ruthless.” “No wrongdoing in the end, and there was no wrongdoing at the beginning.”Not true then, not true now.In 2019, the Office of Inspector General concluded that Zinke violated federal law when he tweeted a photo of himself wearing socks that featured Trump’s face and the words “Make America Great Again.” And in 2018, the agency watchdog determined that Zinke violated government travel policies by bringing his wife on taxpayer-funded trips and by asking staff to explore making her a department volunteer, a move that would have legitimized her travel."}, {"title": "EPA Responds After HuffPost Investigates Gulf Chemical Dump: Nothing To See Here", "text": "After a HuffPost investigation last year brought to light a vast, decades-old chemical dumping ground in the Gulf of Mexico, the Environmental Protection Agency has officially declared that the site is nothing to worry about ― without reviewing any recent scientific data or visiting the site.Last year, HuffPost reported that tens of thousands of 55-gallon drums containing decades-old toxic waste are scattered across a 200-square-mile stretch of ocean floor off the coast of Louisiana, in an area known as Mississippi Canyon. Fossil fuel companies now operate a network of drilling rigs and pipelines within the barrel field — a development that has the potential to disturb drums on the seafloor. The EPA acknowledged at the time it has done little to no oversight since permitting chemical companies to jettison waste there in the 1970s, nor does it know if this offshore dumping has had lingering environmental or human health impacts.In response to HuffPost’s reporting, the EPA launched a review to determine whether the site qualifies for study or cleanup under the federal Superfund program. The assessment is called a pre-CERCLA screening, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, better known as Superfund.The EPA’s review concluded that the site “is not eligible for further investigation” under Superfund because there is no evidence of harm.“No release has been indicated and no threat to human health and the environment has been shown,” Michelle Delgado-Brown, a Superfund site assessment manager at EPA Region 6 in Dallas, wrote in her decision. “Due to the distance from the shoreline (approximately 60 miles offshore) and the depth of the disposal (3,000-feet depth of water), there is no direct contact threat for public health and there are currently no known environmental/public health concerns associated with the site.”The report is dated Dec. 29, 2021, but was not provided to HuffPost until last week.For the screening, Delgado-Brown solely reviewed EPA-issued dumping permits and other historical documents from the 1970s. Every reference document in the report is from 1977 or prior. The agency did not collect or review sediment or water samples for the presence of pollutants, consult with independent scientists or oil and gas companies that operate in the area, or consider how offshore development might be impacting existing barrels, according to information in the report.The result is a document that shines little if any new light on a forgotten, nearly 50-year-old dumping ground — and shuts the door on a more thorough study.“EPA did not perform any kind of comprehensive evaluation,” Charles McCreery, a former water quality expert with the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management who spent years investigating and trying to bring attention to the site, said via email when contacted about the findings. “They looked at permits and not the site.”McCreery, who issued a report on the site to Congress in 2019, stressed that he’s aware of no publicly available surveys or sediment analyses of the barrel field.Samantha Joye, an oceanographer and microbiologist at the University of Georgia who has done extensive research in Mississippi Canyon, called the EPA’s screening perfunctory and inadequate.“This is classic ‘out of sight, out of mind,’” she said.The EPA did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the report.To be fair, pre-CERCLA screenings are skeleton reviews meant to guide the EPA in determining next steps for sites brought to the agency’s attention. On its website, the EPA describes them as “relatively low-cost initial” assessments that involve “reviewing existing information and collecting minimal additional information to determine whether a site warrants entry into the Superfund active inventory for further site assessment evaluation.”Only about one-fifth of these screenings lead to further action under Superfund, including in-depth assessments, site visits and remediation.But the EPA’s decision to forgo a more comprehensive assessment at Mississippi Canyon — the kind that could dive into the concerns scientists raised last year about potential impacts to the environment, fisheries and even human health — appears to hinge on the agency’s own dearth of knowledge about the site.The EPA is responsible for monitoring designated offshore dumping grounds. Yet it has not tracked potential short- and long-term environmental impacts at the inactive Mississippi Canyon dump site. As an agency spokesperson told HuffPost last year, “Potential effects have not been assessed.”In some cases, the EPA required chemical companies to study environmental impacts, including whether contaminants persisted in the food chain, as a condition of their offshore dumping permit. In 1973, for example, DuPont reported to the EPA that its barrel dumping in Mississippi Canyon resulted in “no long-term or short-term effects” and that it did not find “any definitive pattern that bioaccumulation has been greater inside the dumping zone than outside.”The EPA keeps this and other impact reports in its archives, but did not review them as part of its eight-month screening. HuffPost has only reviewed the DuPont study, which McCreery obtained as part of a public records request.There’s also nothing in the EPA’s report to indicate that the probe included consulting with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management or the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which regulate offshore oil and gas development and require companies to report any incidents involving barrels at Mississippi Canyon.As of last year, there had been no reported incidents of worker exposure or equipment damage in the barrel field, according to the BOEM.The two Interior Department bureaus routinely notify offshore operators of the hazards associated with the site, where an estimated 205,000 steel barrels of chlorinated hydrocarbons and other chemical wastes were discarded.“Bidders and lessees are advised that the blocks associated with the disposal site and adjacent blocks that are included in the sale area may exhibit hazards from barrel contents (toxic, corrosive, and/or potentially explosive materials),” read a notice for last year’s Gulf lease sale.EPA’s pre-CERCLA decision form includes a 12-question checklist about the site and its known associated risks. In response to the question about whether there is “evidence of an actual release or a potential to release” at the Mississippi Canyon barrel field, Delgado-Brown answered “no.”But saltwater is known to corrode steel over time, and an internal policy that Shell maintains for avoiding seafloor drums while operating in Mississippi Canyon notes that “many of the barrels may have released their contents over time.”“The metallurgy of these drums at some point is going to fail,” said Chris Reddy, an environmental chemist and marine pollution expert at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.Reddy is part of a team that studied a site off the coast of Los Angeles where as many as half a million barrels of the potent and highly toxic insecticide DDT were dumped. Underwater robots captured pictures of barrels that were corroded, punctured and leaking chemicals onto the seafloor. Others looked crunched and weakened, Reddy said.Reddy acknowledged that an in-depth investigation of the Mississippi Canyon site would likely prove costly and labor-intensive, but said he expected more from the EPA’s initial assessment given the potential for the dumped waste to have included more hazardous compounds and byproducts than what companies listed in their 1970s discharge permits.“Our capacity to detect and measure pollutants has dramatically increased in the last 50 years,” he said. “There’s certainly science that could be added to this conversation.”Read the EPA’s report below:"}, {"title": "Western Megadrought Worsens To Driest In At Least 1,200 Years", "text": "The American West’s megadrought deepened so much last year that it is now the driest in at least 1,200 years and is a worst-case climate change scenario playing out live, a new study finds.A dramatic drying in 2021 — about as dry as 2002 and one of the driest years ever recorded for the region — pushed the 22-year drought passed the previous record-holder for megadroughts in the late 1500s and shows no signs of easing in the near future, according to a study Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.The study calculated that 42% of this megadrought can be attributed to human-caused  climate change.“Climate change is changing the baseline conditions toward a drier, gradually drier state in the West and that means the worst-case scenario keeps getting worse,” said study lead author Park Williams, a climate hydrologist at UCLA. “This is right in line with what people were thinking of in the 1900s as a worst-case scenario. But today I think we need to be even preparing for conditions in the future that are far worse than this.”Williams studied soil moisture levels in the West — a box that includes California, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, most of Oregon and Idaho, much of New Mexico, western Colorado, northern Mexico, and the southwest corners of Montana and Texas — using modern measurements and tree rings for estimates that go back to the year 800. That’s about as far back as estimates can reliably go with tree rings.A few years ago, Williams studied the current drought and said it qualified as a lengthy and deep “megadrought” and that the only worse one was in the 1500s. He figured the current drought wouldn’t surpass that one because megadroughts tended to peter out after 20 years. And, he said, 2019 was a wet year so it looked like the western drought might be coming to an end.But the region dried up in late 2020 and 2021.All of California was considered in official drought from mid-May until the end of 2021, and at least three-quarters of the state was at the highest two drought levels from June through Christmas, according to the U.S. drought monitor.“For this drought to have just cranked up back to maximum drought intensity in late 2020 through 2021 is a quite emphatic statement by this 2000s drought saying that we’re nowhere close to the end,” Williams said. This drought is now 5% drier than the old record from the 1500s, he said.The drought monitor says 55% of the U.S. West is in drought with 13% experiencing the two highest drought levels.This megadrought really kicked off in 2002 — one of the driest years ever, based on humidity and tree rings, Williams said.“I was wondering if we’d ever see a year like 2002 again in my life and in fact, we saw it 20 years later, within the same drought,” Williams said. The drought levels in 2002 and 2021 were a statistical tie, though still behind 1580 for the worst single year.Climate change from the burning of fossil fuels is bringing hotter temperatures and increasing evaporation in the air, scientists say.Williams used 29 models to create a hypothetical world with no human-caused warming then compared it to what happened in real life — the scientifically accepted way to check if an extreme weather event is due to climate change. He found that 42% of the drought conditions are directly from human-caused warming. Without climate change, he said, the megadrought would have ended early on because 2005 and 2006 would have been wet enough to break it.The study “is an important wake-up call,” said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of environment at the University of Michigan, who wasn’t part of the study. “Climate change is literally baking the water supply and forests of the Southwest, and it could get a whole lot worse if we don’t halt climate change soon.”Williams said there is a direct link between drought and heat and the increased wildfires that have been devastating the West for years. Fires need dry fuel that drought and heat promote.Eventually, this megadrought will end by sheer luck of a few good rainy years, Williams said. But then another one will start.Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t involved in the study, said climate change is likely to make megadrought “a permanent feature of the climate of the Colorado River watershed during the 21st century.”___Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/Climate___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears."}, {"title": "Twitter Wits Suddenly Get Why Trump Had Such Problems Flushing His Water-Efficient Toilets", "text": "Donald Trump’s obsession against environmentally sensitive, water-efficient appliances and fixtures — like toilets — is suddenly making a whole lotta sense to Twitter followers.New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman’s revelation in her upcoming book “Confidence Man” that Trump’s White House toilets were often clogged with what appeared to be ripped up documents could explain a lot of things — like Trump’s confounding complaints about serious flushing difficulties.Trump has flatly denied Haberman’s report, calling it a “fake story.” But he has complained about flushing issues in the past, leaving many people confused.Americans, he groused in a 2019 meeting to business leaders, are flushing their toilets “10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.”Absolutely.

Jorgensen alleges that when her family visited the aquarium in September 2019, a giant otter reached over a glass barrier and bit her then-2-year-old daughter’s hand. The plexiglass barrier around the enclosure was about 5 and a half feet tall, but the toddler was sitting on the shoulders of her father, who is 6 feet, 3 inches.To clarify, a giant otter doesn’t just mean a really big otter. Giant otters are their own species, native to South America. They live in freshwater, mostly eat fish and males can grow up to 6 feet long. Here’s a photo of one in the wild:The aquarium did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost.The lawsuit, which includes a photo of the bloody injury, states that the otter bite pulled one of the toddler’s fingernails “clean off.” The suit also alleges that the incident caused “permanent scarring.”The aquarium currently has a warning reading, “BE AWARE: GIANT OTTERS ARE ACTIVE ANIMALS AND CAN INJURE YOU,” but the suit alleges this warning was not present during the family’s visit and that they had no idea the otters were able to get over the top of the enclosure.The suit is seeking damages of $250,000 to $1 million.The allegations echo those from a lawsuit filed in October, according to The Dallas Morning News. In that suit, a woman said a giant otter reached over the top of the enclosure and scratched her 18-month-old son. The wound became infected and ultimately caused what the family said was permanent scarring on his arm.

By some estimates, up to 60,000 koalas were killed or injured in the blazes, prompting environmental groups to nominate the species for the endangered listing.The listing applies to the states of New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory.But conservationists say koalas — first listed as vulnerable in 2012 — were under severe threat long before the bushfires. Severe drought and fires exacerbated by climate change, along with a loss in habitat, have contributed to their demise, and studies released in 2020 found koala populations had fallen by at least 50% in the state of Queensland since 2001 and between 33% and 61% in New South Wales during the same period.“The new listing highlights the challenges the species is facing,” Ley said in a statement Friday, pointing to government plans to spend 50 million Australian dollars ($35.7 million USD) to better protect them.“The impact of prolonged drought, followed by the black summer bushfires, and the cumulative impacts of disease, urbanization and habitat loss over the past twenty years have led to the advice,” she said.The designation will provide some additional protection for koalas, namely more assessment requirements for development projects. But it doesn’t mandate any extra rules to protect their habitat, The Sydney Morning Herald noted.Ley said a national plan to help protect them would be sent to states that are home to the endangered creatures, but the plan’s size has drawn criticism as a mere drop in the ocean, particularly as land-clearing efforts expand and the Australian government stands firmly by fossil fuel production.Scientists, environmentalists and lawmakers have been ringing warning bells about koala populations for years. In 2020, a government-backed inquiry said koalas were in danger of going locally extinct in the state of New South Wales — home to Sydney — by 2050 without urgent action to protect their habitat.Environmental groups welcomed the bittersweet news on Friday, saying the upgraded listing means koalas “and their forest homes should be provided with greater protection.”“Koalas have gone from no-listing to vulnerable to endangered within a decade. That is a shockingly fast decline,” Stuart Blanch, a conservation scientist with the Australian branch of the WWF, said in a statement. “Today’s decision is welcome, but it won’t stop koalas from sliding towards extinction unless it’s accompanied by stronger laws and landholder incentives to protect their forest homes.”The International Fund for Animal Welfare said the decision was a double-edged sword.“We should never have allowed things to get to the point where we are at risk of losing a national icon,” Rebecca Keeble, the group’s regional director for Oceania, said in a statement. “It is a dark day for our nation. If we can’t protect an iconic species endemic to Australia, what chance do lesser known but no less important species have?”The koala’s plight is only the latest major environmental issue to arise in Australia. The government has drawn fierce scrutiny over its efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef, which has been hit repeatedly by coral bleaching linked to climate change. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country planned to throw $700 million at that problem last month, but scientists said the money will do little to save the reef when the government is spending billions more to subsidize coal and gas production."}, {"title": "Gray Wolves Regain Endangered Species Act Protections", "text": "A federal judge on Thursday restored Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves across much of the contiguous United States, concluding that the Trump administration ignored ongoing threats to smaller, more isolated wolf populations when it stripped the species of protections in 2020.U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White’s ruling marks a major win for environmental and animal rights groups in their battle with the federal government over whether wolves still need ESA protections.“This is a huge day for wolves across the country,” said Andrea Zaccardi, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity. “Fish and Wildlife Service has tried to remove federal protections several times over the past decade, and every time they skirt the law in doing it.”The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its parent agency, the Department of Interior, both said they are still reviewing the decision.The ruling redesignates gray wolves as a threatened species in 44 states and strips those states of their ability to manage local wolf populations through hunting and trapping. The relisting applies to the Great Lakes states, including Wisconsin: the site of a controversial wolf hunt last year that blew through the state’s 200-wolf harvest quota in three days.“Today’s ruling restoring much-needed federal protections means that wolves will have a chance to fully recover and carry out their important ecological and cultural roles across the country,” Bonnie Rice, a senior representative of the Sierra Club, said in a statement.But it does not affect wolves in the Northern Rockies ― including Montana, Wyoming and Idaho ― which Congress removed from the ESA in 2011. Those states have loosened hunting and trapping restrictions in a controversial effort to reduce wolf populations.Unregulated hunting and government poisoning campaigns waged on behalf of livestock interests nearly wiped gray wolves off the map in the lower 48 by the early 20th century. They have since become one of the Endangered Species Act’s greatest success stories.Since their reintroduction, beginning in Yellowstone National Park and Idaho in 1994, gray wolves have thrived in some areas. In both Idaho and Montana, populations stand about 10 times higher today than the minimum level of 150 that states have to maintain in order to avoid falling back under Endangered Species Act protection. Wolf populations have also grown in the Great Lakes region.Smaller populations of wolves have also continued to disperse into new areas, particularly on the West Coast and in the Central Rockies.Under the Trump administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service pointed to regions where wolves were thriving to argue that wolf populations across the continental United States had recovered.But that logic failed to consider how wolves would fare without ESA protection outside the few areas where they’ve flourished over the last two decades. It also contradicted the agency’s earlier geographic designations of wolf populations and ignored recent scientific research showing the genetic distinctiveness of pockets of wolves outside the main recovery areas.The Fish and Wildlife Service concluded “with little explanation or analysis, that wolves outside of the core populations are not necessary to the recovery of the species,” White wrote in his ruling.The overturning of the Trump administration’s wolf delisting is likely to resurface longstanding tensions over how to manage the large carnivores, especially in the West. Ranching interests and some hunting groups have championed state management as a way to keep wolves from attacking livestock or big game animals.But more liberal and urban constituencies have tended to favor letting wolves flourish. Some 1.8 million people submitted public comments opposing the Trump administration’s decision to delist wolves. A Colorado measure passed in 2020 requires the state’s parks and wildlife division to reintroduce gray wolves.It’s unclear whether the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Joe Biden will fight Thursday’s ruling and continue its years-long effort to remove gray wolves from the ESA. But his administration’s interior secretary, Deb Haaland, appears more sympathetic to relisting wolves in the face of aggressive hunting and trapping campaigns.In a recent op-ed in USA Today, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland wrote that new state laws in Idaho and Montana are jeopardizing decades of work to recover gray wolves in the northern Rockies.“We will reinstate federal protections under the ESA for the northern Rocky Mountains’ gray wolf, if necessary,” she wrote."}, {"title": "Prince William Focuses On Conservation During First UAE Trip", "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Britain’s Prince William on Thursday made his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates, where the future monarch highlighted his passionate work around wildlife conservation and climate change.The prince delivered an urgent warning on those issues before an audience at the World’s Fair in Dubai, known as Expo 2020. He spoke at an event to showcase The Earthshot Prize, a global award the prince founded to highlight and scale solutions to repair the planet.“This is the decisive decade,” he said. “If we do nothing, by 2030 we’ll be speeding toward increasingly devastating planetary and humanitarian crises as a result of our changing climate.”“We are still in a race against time,” he said.The one-day visit by the Duke of Cambridge marks a significant milestone in relations between the United Kingdom and the UAE, a Western-allied Gulf Arab nation ruled by hereditary leaders. The prince is expected to meet with Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the son of Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.Queen Elizabeth II first visited the UAE as monarch in 1979, while Prince Charles’ last visit was in 2016.Once an informal British protectorate, the UAE has long been a magnet for British nationals. There are more than 100,000 British citizens living in the UAE and more than 6,000 British companies operating in the country, according to the British Business Group in Dubai and Northern Emirates.The Duke of Cambridge’s visit coincides with the U.K.‘s national day at Expo 2020. Prince William visited the U.K. pavilion and toured the $7 billion grounds of the Expo site, as well as the United Arab Emirates’ falcon-shaped pavilion.A sizeable crowd gathered outside the British pavilion, with children waving the Union Jack, women calling out the prince’s name and a group of men impromptu singing “God Save the Queen.”As Prince William toured the UAE, news emerged that his 73-year-old father, Prince Charles, had tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating. It’s the second time the heir to the throne contracts the coronavirus.In his first stop in Dubai, Prince William visited DP World’s massive Jebel Ali Port, where he watched cargo being scanned and inspected by customs to apparently highlight efforts tackling the illegal wildlife trade. His visit comes more than 40 years after his grandmother inaugurated the port during her royal UAE tour.The Dubai-based global ports operator DP World is a principal partner of Prince William’s United for Wildlife, an initiative established by the prince in 2014 to help counter trade in illegal wildlife. The port operator, in partnership with Dubai Expo 2020, is also among the founding funding partners to the prince’s Earthshot Prize.Last year’s finalists talked about their innovative solutions to an audience at Expo’s DP World pavilion following remarks by Prince William, who referred to the Dubai government-owned port company as among the “incredible financers” of The Eartshot Prize.Launched by Prince William and The Royal Foundation in late 2020, The Earthshot Prize held its first-ever award ceremony last year, offering five, 1 million-pound ($1.36 million) prizes to innovators and entrepreneurs seeking solutions to the world’s greatest environmental problems. The award is being funded for 10 years, totaling 50 prizes. This year’s award ceremony will be held in the United States.The duke, like his father Prince Charles, has long used his platform to advocate for greater environmental awareness, warning that the Earth is at a tipping point and facing irreparable damage unless action is taken to repair the planet.“Our future is not yet set,” the prince said at Expo. “We still have the ability to repair out planet and create a better world.”Prince William, who is traveling without his wife, Catherine, began his tour in the UAE with a visit to Abu Dhabi’s Jubail Mangrove Park. There, he met with children planting mangroves, and he planted one himself. He was accompanied by Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a son of Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince.Katy Holmes, general manager of the British Business Group, said Britons are really excited about the prince’s visit because it sends a positive message about strengthening a bilateral relationship so well established by Queen Elizabeth II, who marked 70 years on the throne Sunday.“He’s very well regarded as a royal and he is the future of the U.K. monarchy, so I think there’s interest from that perspective. But it’s also a celebration of Expo,” said Holmes, who is among those invited to attend an evening performance at Expo that will be attended by Prince William.The territories of the UAE have attracted British attention since the early 18th Century, when the area was seen as part of a strategic Persian Gulf trade route with links to India and other British colonies. The territories, ruled by various tribal sheikhs, later signed an agreement restricting their foreign relations to British discretion until the founding of the United Arab Emirates in 1971.Oil wealth helped rapidly transform Abu Dhabi’s and Dubai’s humid coastlines into a head-turning metropolis of skyscrapers and endless five-star hotels. South Asian migrant workers have borne the brunt of building and paving the UAE’s cities from the desert up. British nationals, however, have largely enjoyed the higher pay, warmer winters, lower tax rates and luxury living conditions afforded to Western expatriates in the Gulf.British nationals fill critical teaching jobs in the country, but also hold a range of positions working as hair stylists, fitness trainers, real estate brokers, bartenders, hotel managers and events planners, to name a few. British accents dominate English-language radio broadcasts and British pub culture is popular in Dubai."}, {"title": "Tire Finally Removed From Crocodile's Neck After 6 Years", "text": "PALU, Indonesia (AP) — A wild crocodile with a used motorcycle tire stuck around its neck for six years has finally been freed by an Indonesian bird catcher in a tireless effort that wildlife conservation officials hailed as a milestone Wednesday.The 4.5-meter (14.8-foot) saltwater female crocodile has become an icon to the people in Palu, the capital city of Central Sulawesi. The beast was seen on the city’s river with the tire around its neck becoming increasingly tighter, running the risk of choking her.Conservation officials were racing to rescue the crocodile since residents spotted the reptile in 2016, generating sympathy among residents and worldwide. In 2020, Australian crocodile wrangler Matthew Wright and American wildlife biologist Forrest Galante tried and failed to free the reptile.In early January, 35-year-old bird catcher and trader Tili, who recently moved to the city, heard about the famous crocodile from his neighbors and determined to rescue the reptile after he saw her frequently sunbathing at a nearby estuary.“I have experiences and skills in catching animals, not only birds, but farm animals that are released from the cage,” Tili, who goes by a single name, told The Associated Press. “I believe I can rescue the crocodile with my skills.”He stringed ropes of various sizes into a trap tied to a tree near the river, and laid chickens, ducks and birds as bait. After three weeks of waiting and several failed attempts, the crocodile finally fell into the trap Monday night. With the help of two of his friends, Tili pulled the trapped crocodile ashore and sawed through the tire, which was 50 centimeters (1.6 feet) in diameter.A video that circulated widely on the internet showed a crowd cheering nearby as Tili and his friends broke the crocodile free. Other residents then contacted firefighters and a wildlife conservation agency to help them release the animal back into the wild.“For all of the efforts Tili has done for protected wildlife and being the kind of animal lover he is, that’s a great milestone,” said Haruna Hamma who heads Central Sulawesi province’s conservation agency.He said it was unclear how a used motorcycle tire got stuck around the crocodile neck. Conservationists have said that it was likely deliberately placed by people in a failed attempt to trap it as a pet or skin it for sale, but crocodiles and other swimming reptiles often travel into garbage-studded waters with nothing to stop a tire from encircling them, Hamma said.Government data recorded 279 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands, between 2007 and 2014. Of these, as many as 268 cases of attacks were carried out by saltwater crocodiles, of which 135 were fatal.Despite the attacks, the saltwater crocodile is protected under Indonesian law."}, {"title": "Lawmakers Urge Pentagon To Update Climate Plans In Upcoming Strategy To Keep U.S. ‘Safe’", "text": "A coalition of lawmakers urged the Pentagon this week to better address climate change in its upcoming National Defense Strategy, saying a concrete plan to respond to a warming world could save millions of lives and billions of dollars.The letter, addressed to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, was spearheaded by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Alongside 16 other members of Congress, the group said the Pentagon’s current national security budget — a mammoth $777 billion — fails “to protect Americans from the worsening climate crisis” and does not address the agency’s role “as the world’s largest consumer of fossil fuels and emitter of greenhouse gases.”“Climate change is a clear and present threat to both national security and Americans,” the lawmakers wrote on Monday. “A strategy that integrates climate change considerations at all levels, and shifts our national security budget to effectively address these threats is a critical step to keeping the United States and its citizens safe.”The lawmakers went on to urge the Pentagon to ensure the National Defense Strategy prioritizes federal investment to tackle climate risks, and “not accept climate change and rising temperatures as an inevitable.”“By treating the climate crisis as the existential and national security threat that it is through the National Defense Strategy, DoD can maintain national security and military readiness, avoid billions of dollars in damages and save millions of lives,” they wrote.Lee has long urged the Defense Department to be more transparent about its efforts to combat climate change. In November, the lawmaker introduced a resolution calling on the agency to release details about its annual greenhouse gas emissions after the Pentagon failed to do so by a July 1 deadline mandated in a defense spending bill.Warren has also called on the agency to increase its resilience against climate change, and has been a major critic of the fossil fuel industry.The Pentagon’s own climate risk assessment, released last October, was just one of several government reports to warn the military will need to spend a significant portion of its annual budget to address climate-related threats in the near future. Bases are already under threat from flooding, wildfires and rising seas, as well as increased numbers of damaging storms.The lawmakers noted Monday that the Defense Department requested nearly $9 billion in additional funding in 2019 to repair damage to military bases after several hurricanes, stressing such threats will only grow if greenhouse gas emissions are not reined in.A separate report by the nation’s intelligence agencies said climate-related threats will exacerbate global tensions and lead to an uptick in conflict between nations’ borders."}, {"title": "Democrats Block Trump EPA Chief's Bid For Top Virginia Environmental Post", "text": "Democratic lawmakers in Virginia rejected Gov.

Try to keep your fish from an orca, and he’ll figure out how to eat them — and teach all his friends to do the same.Orcas, also known as killer whales, have long been known to dine on fish that people have caught in lines or nets. And a new paper examining the phenomenon paints a picture of how the socially complex animals respond to their environment being altered by human activity.The paper, published in the journal Biology Letters, analyzed years of data involving two different killer whale populations near the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean.Since the 1990s, the region has been a hotspot for commercial fishing of the Patagonian toothfish — a fish often marketed under the name “Chilean sea bass.” The toothfish are caught on longlines along the bottom of the ocean floor, meaning that one big fishing line is baited with many hooks and each hook nabs an individual fish.As the lines get drawn up from the deep water, they essentially become “the open ocean equivalent of the conveyor belt in a sushi bar,” as Luke Rendell, a Scottish biology lecturer uninvolved with the study, put it in a piece for The Conversation.The researchers looked at data from 2003 to 2018 and noted that incidents of orcas eating the fish off the hooks, referred to as “depredation,” gradually increased over time. This seemed to be due to individual orcas picking up the behavior from one another. One of the orca populations the scientists studied was first reported feeding off of fishery catches in 1996. By 2014, all 80 to 100 orcas in the group had started doing it.In addition to the ease of snatching fish off of a fishing line, another reason contributing to the behavior catching on could be overfishing. In the 2000s, as the population declined, it became more difficult for orcas to catch toothfish themselves, but they then encountered “increased and predictable” opportunities to pluck their prey off of fishing lines.Overall, the researchers were struck by how thoroughly commercial fishing had changed the orcas’ behavior over time.“This study is illustrative of how human activities, by altering the availability of resources in ecosystems, may lead to new behaviours (sic) spreading across individuals of species capable of innovating in response to changes in their environment,” they wrote."}, {"title": "Candace Cameron Bure Says She And Bob Saget Got Into 'Little Tiff' Before His Death", "text": "Candace Cameron Bure lovingly recalled her final conversation and last words with Bob Saget before the comedian died in January.During an appearance on “Today” this week, Bure told Hoda Kotb that she and Saget, who played her father on “Full House,” got into a “little tiff” just two weeks before Saget died, but luckily were able to patch things up right away.“We were going to have dinner.

Preventing Them Is Cheap.", "text": "New research reinforces the old adage that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” when it comes to preventing future pandemics.With the world now entering its third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a team of 20 experts have released a “blueprint” for stopping animal-borne pathogens from spilling over into humans. The study, led by Harvard University researchers and published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, finds that implementing just three pandemic prevention strategies — halting deforestation, improving disease monitoring and surveillance, and better managing the wildlife trade — would cost a fraction of the annual economic and human losses that result from emerging infectious diseases.Less than 5%, to be exact ― and that’s a conservative estimate.Aaron Bernstein, the study’s lead author and director of Harvard’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, said during a call with reporters this week that given the world’s ongoing experience with COVID-19, it would be foolish not to invest in an alternative path that costs 5 cents on the dollar.“Our salvation comes cheap,” he said.Pathogens that spread from animals to humans are known as zoonotic diseases, and scientists warn that the threat of transmission is increasing as humans destroy ecosystems and exploit wildlife. The COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have started when the novel coronavirus leapt from bats to humans at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has so far killed more than 5.7 million people worldwide, including nearly 900,000 in the United States, and could cost the global economy $12.5 trillion through 2024.For its study, the Harvard-led team reviewed mortality data for all emerging zoonotic diseases that killed at least 10 people dating back to the 1918 Spanish flu. It concludes that with today’s population, 3.3 million people are expected to die each year from virus outbreaks. This loss of life translates to between $350 billion to $21 trillion annually, depending on different monetary estimates for the value of an individual human life. On top of that, disease outbreaks cause an estimated $212 billion annually in direct economic losses, according to the study.By comparison, advancing techniques to avert future outbreaks, which the report identifies as “primary pandemic prevention,” would cost an estimated $20 billion annually. And it wouldn’t take much for this kind of global investment to pay off.“Even if we were to reduce the risk of a bad pandemic by 1%, these measures would be cost-effective,” Bernstein said. “These measures have to be very modestly effective to justify their value.”The study makes a clear case for shifting resources from pandemic preparedness and response to early prevention. The authors argue that the world is going about fighting emerging zoonotic diseases all wrong, focusing on vaccines, testing and other post-outbreak actions while largely ignoring ways to stamp out the next pandemic before it starts.“Prominent policymakers have promoted plans that argue the best ways to address future pandemic catastrophes should entail, ‘detecting and containing emerging zoonotic threats,’” the report states. “In other words, we should take actions only after humans get sick. We sharply disagree.”Stuart Pimm, a study author and ecology professor at Duke University, said it is obvious that the tools for battling COVID-19 are far from perfect.“Only 60% of Americans are vaccinated. We’re not getting vaccines anywhere near the numbers we need to to people in poor countries,” he said. “We need to start thinking about preventions. Those preventions are broadly things that we know how to do, and broadly things that we could implement quite quickly.”Deforestation and other land-use changes are the single biggest driver of zoonotic disease outbreaks that have occurred since 1940, a 2015 study found. At the United Nations’ climate conference last year in Scotland, more than 100 nations, including Brazil, the U.S., Canada and Russia, signed an initiative to halt deforestation by the end of the decade. But a similar pact in 2014 did little to slow the razing of the world’s forests.The new study notes that refocusing global pandemic efforts toward prevention would come with significant additional benefits, including preventing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, protecting water supplies and safeguarding biodiversity.Bernstein argues that the world’s current approach for dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases would be akin to confronting climate change solely through adaptation, without any mitigation.“If we were living on a planet with a stable climate and an intact biosphere, we might be able to afford waiting until disaster happens and trying to contain it,” he said. “But the reality is we don’t, and to operate on that premise is one of the greatest pieces of folly in modern times. To ignore the reality that the driver of disease emergence has to do with tumult in the living world and how we’re doing business with it, is really shocking in this day and age. And we simply cannot afford to take a post-spillover approach alone.”"}, {"title": "Winter Storm Prompts Warnings Of Thick Ice Across U.S., Leaves Thousands Without Power", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Americans were without power on Thursday as a fierce winter storm dropped snow and freezing rain on a wide swath of the country, prompting thousands of flight cancellations and warnings of dangerous ice accumulations across the Northeast.The Associated Press noted most of the power outages so far were linked to icy or downed power lines in Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas and Ohio, but the storm’s path threatened homes into the South and Northeast. The National Weather Service warned the Northeast that the storm was moving through the region, saying some areas in Pennsylvania and southern New England could see up to a foot of snow and others could get up to half an inch of ice.Parts of the Midwest, including the Chicago area, have already seen nearly a foot of snow, and the Arkansas Department of Transportation warned that any precipitation was expected to freeze overnight “and heighten the potential for black ice tomorrow.”“The freezing rain over the Mid-South will progress northeastward into the Northeast Thursday evening, where significant ice accumulation is possible from central Pennsylvania eastward into the Catskills in New York,” the National Weather Service said Thursday. “The snow/rain/freezing rain could make for difficult travel conditions along with some power outages and tree damage.”New York Gov.

Greg Abbott (R) said Thursday the storm was “one of the most significant icing events that we’ve had in the state of Texas in at least several decades,” although officials said the event wasn’t as severe as last year’s damaging deep freeze, which left many residents without power amid frigid temperatures for more than two weeks.The state’s energy grid appeared to be meeting demand into Thursday, a major test for Abbott and the state’s emergency response effort, The Dallas Morning News reported.More than 6,000 scheduled flights were canceled on Thursday and Friday, and 110 million people, almost a third of the country, were under winter weather warnings or advisories. Strong winds across parts of the South prompted weather officials to warn of severe thunderstorms and the potential for tornadoes.Alabama reported a tornado near Sawyerville on Thursday, which left at least one woman dead and several others injured."}, {"title": "Explosion Risk 'Greatly Diminished' At North Carolina Fertilizer Plant", "text": "The risk of an explosion at a North Carolina fertilizer plant that caught fire earlier this week has “greatly diminished,” but the community isn’t out of the woods yet, officials said Thursday.Flames have consumed enough of the combustible substances at the plant in Winston-Salem for firefighters to go in and begin “cooling operations,” said the city’s fire chief, William “Trey” Mayo, on Thursday after consulting with an expert on the explosives.When the Winston Weaver Company fertilizer plant caught fire on Monday evening, it held about 5,000 tons of finished fertilizer and 600 tons of ammonium nitrate — which can create toxic nitrogen oxide and ammonia when exposed to high temperatures, and may explode.That’s enough ammonium nitrate to cause “one of the worst explosions in U.S. history,” Mayo said Wednesday. Up until now, it’s been too dangerous for firefighters to approach the scene.The fire department now has about 500 gallons of water per minute flowing onto piles of fertilizer and ammonium nitrate at the facility. However, Mayo added, “We don’t know what may happen when we start, you know, getting in and poking around in the plant and moving things around with heavy equipment.”“At this point, the greatest risk is from a rapid fire condition due to moving stuff around and opening things that have the heat and the fuel, but they don’t have the air,” he explained.People are still advised to stay far away from the area, he added.Overnight rain helped reduce the explosion risk as well, but it also increased contaminated runoff water and pushed smoke closer to the ground, posing a greater health hazard. The Environmental Protection Agency is on site, monitoring those exposure risks to the community.“They’re measuring particulate matter, they’re measuring compounds of sulfur, they’re measuring ammonia, they’re measuring nitrogen dioxide,” Mayo said.Questions about fire safety at the facility have swirled in the days since the fire ignited. The Winston-Salem plant was built in 1939, the media has noted, allowing it to bypass current ordinances requiring sprinklers to be in place.“It’s difficult to speculate, but what we do know is, historically ... there’s never been a multi-death fire in America in a building that was properly equipped with fire sprinklers,” Mayo said Thursday when asked about the role sprinklers could have played.City council member D.D. Adams promised to find help for the 6,500 people who’ve incurred the costs of evacuating the area.“They don’t feel safe. They’re anxious. They’re nervous,” she said at Thursday’s press conference. “They don’t know when some of them are coming back home. And the hotel bills are killing them because most of everyone lives from paycheck to paycheck.”Mayo spoke through tears as he recalled the high-stakes decisions his department has had to make in response to the fire and the moment the ammonium nitrate expert he brought in told him they’d done exactly what was needed.“I can go to bed and sleep for the rest of my life being confident in the decisions we made this week,” Mayo said."}, {"title": "Wandering Hen Caught Sneaking Around Pentagon Security Area", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A wandering chicken was caught sneaking around a security area at the Pentagon, a local animal welfare organization said.The loose hen was found early Monday morning near the U.S. Department of Defense headquarters, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, Virginia, wrote on social media.“Apparently, the answer to ‘why did the chicken cross the road’ is to get to the Pentagon,” the group posted.The chicken was taken into custody by one of the league’s employees.Chelsea Jones, a spokesperson for the organization, said in an email that she couldn’t reveal the precise location where the bird was spotted.“We are not allowed to disclose exactly where she was found,” Jones said. “We can only say it was at a security checkpoint.”It’s also unclear where the chicken came from or how she got to the Pentagon.The hen — which has brown feathers and a red comb and wattles — is a Rhode Island Red.

Heavy snow was expected from the southern Rockies to northern New England, while forecasters said heavy ice buildup was likely from Texas to Pennsylvania.“We have a lot of real estate covered by winter weather impacts this morning,” Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, said early Thursday. “We do have an expansive area of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain occurring.”Parts of Ohio, New York and northern New England were expected to see heavy snowfall as the storm moves to the east with 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) of snow possible in some places through Friday, Orrison said.Along the warmer side of the storm, strong thunderstorms capable of damaging wind gusts and tornadoes were possible Thursday in parts of Mississippi and Alabama, the Storm Prediction Center said.More than 20 inches (51 centimeters) of snow was reported in the southern Rockies, while more than a foot of snow fell in areas of Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.Sleet and freezing rain were occurring early Thursday in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and in parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were without power, mostly in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas, according to the website poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports.“Unfortunately we are looking at enough ice accumulations that we will be looking at significant travel impacts,” Orrison said.Ice began accumulating Thursday in parts of West Tennessee including Memphis, Tennessee, causing power outages and dangerous road conditions during the morning commute. Trees sagged under the weight of ice, resulting in fallen tree limbs and branches. Parked cars had a layer of ice on them and authorities in several communities around Memphis warned of some cars sliding off slick roadways.Texas had about 70,000 power outages Thursday morning, far from the more than 4 million outages that paralyzed the state during the February 2021 freeze in one of the worst blackouts in U.S. history.The return of subfreezing weather and ice in Texas was unsettling to many residents after last year’s catastrophic outages. In San Antonio, where roughly 30,000 homes were without power Thursday morning, officials stressed the outages were local disruptions — such as downed power lines — and not grid failures.South Bend, Indiana, reported a record snowfall for the date on Wednesday with 11.2 inches (28.5 centimeters), eclipsing the previous record of 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) set on the date in 1908, said Hannah Carpenter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s office in Syracuse, Indiana.Once the storm pushes through, she said temperatures will see a big drop, with Friday’s highs mostly in the upper teens followed by lows in the single digits in northern Indiana, along with bone-chilling wind chills.“It’s definitely not going to be melting real quick here,” Carpenter said Thursday morning.The frigid temperatures settled into areas after the snowy weather, with Kansas residents awakening to dangerous wind chills of around 15 below zero (26 degrees Celsius below zero). In New Mexico, schools and nonessential government services were closed in some areas Thursday because of the icy roads.The disruptive storm began Tuesday and moved across the central U.S. on Wednesday’s Groundhog Day, the same day the famed groundhog Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter. The storm came on the heels of a nor’easter last weekend that brought blizzard conditions to many parts of the East Coast.Airlines canceled nearly 7,000 flights in the U.S. scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, the flight-tracking service FlightAware.com showed. More than 1,000 flights were canceled Thursday alone at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and more than 300 were canceled at nearby Dallas Love Field.___Bleed reported from Little Rock, Arkansas.

They get very aggressive,” said sponsor Raquel Regalado, whose district includes neighborhoods in Coral Gables and Miami where peacocks roam freely. “They lay their eggs, they build their nests, they peck the cars.”Neighbors often clash over the peacocks. Some love the colorful birds while others complain of droppings, noise and the damage they cause by roosting on cars or houses.“In my district, we learn to live with these peacocks,” said Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins, representing Palmetto Bay, which has designated itself a bird sanctuary. “They almost become a part of the community. I know our residents lose it when anyone harms any of these peacocks.”Non-native species have a tendency to wear out their welcome in sunny Florida, where the state wildlife commission has encouraged the killing of iguanas and Burmese pythons.The county’s 2001 peafowl ordinance was adopted following a petition drive to save a flock of peacocks in south Miami-Dade, forbidding their killing or capture. An exemption allowed homeowners to remove them, and one neighborhood did so in 2020 after an amendment allowed for removal of excess peacocks.State laws on non-native species prevent them from being released back into the wild, however, and many sanctuaries won’t take them.“We searched statewide for a sanctuary or zoo that would accept them,” said Assistant Director Kathy Labrada. “The alternative is humane euthanasia.”Regalado initially tried to repeal the ordinance entirely, but other commissioners resisted to avoid killing the birds, the Herald reported.“Are we talking about sentencing peacocks to death now?” asked Commissioner Oliver Gilbert.Commissioners finally agreed 5-4 to water down the law, allowing cities to opt out after submitting peafowl “mitigation” plans.Regalado said the challenge for municipal leaders will be finding places to relocate the peacocks, since euthanizing them likely won’t win support.“This really is not about killing,” she said. “This is about moving.”"}, {"title": "Punxsutawney Phil Makes His Groundhog Day Prediction: 6 More Weeks Of Winter", "text": "PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa.

(AP) — Seven years after Oregon voters legalized the regulated production and use of recreational marijuana, the state Legislature is set to consider a raft of measures to crack down on an explosion of illegal pot farms.Underscoring the industrial-size scale of the illegal marijuana farms, the Rogue Area Drug Enforcement, or RADE, announced this week it seized 52 tons of illegal marijuana last year. That was in southern Oregon alone.The amount of pot seized was greater than previous years, Grants Pass Police Department Detective Sgt. Doni Hamilton, a member of the RADE team, said in an email.Many of the growers are claiming to be legal hemp farmers but are instead cultivating plants with illegal amounts of THC, the component that creates the “high,” according to the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission.“A lot of people have been using hemp as a cover,” OLCC spokesperson Mark Pettinger said in an interview last year.One of the bills put forward for Oregon’s five-week legislative session that began Tuesday aims to financially punish those who are operating under the guise of growing hemp. Industrial hemp was legalized nationally by Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill.Under a bill sponsored by Sen. Bill Hansell, R-Athena, and Rep. Lily Morgan, R-Grants Pass, a building or other premises used for unlawful growing or handling of hemp would be subjected to lien and could be sold to pay all fines and costs.Another bill authorizes the Oregon Department of Agriculture to refuse to issue industrial hemp grower licenses, based on supply and demand for the product.Meanwhile, a bill sponsored by Sen. Tim Knopp, leader of the minority Republicans in the Senate, would have the Oregon State Police establish a unit to assist overwhelmed county sheriffs’ offices in uprooting the illegal pot farms.The state police would ensure that each county sheriff’s office receives at least $500,000 annually for the offensive on illegal pot growers, with more resources going to sheriffs who demonstrate a greater need. The Oregon Department of Revenue would transfer funds to the state police for these purposes.During this year’s short legislative session, lawmakers have numerous bills to push through committees and send to both the House and Senate for approval. Many will die along the way in the limited time period, especially those that haven’t been fine-tuned yet, leaders of the majority Democratic caucus said Tuesday.But Senate President Peter Courtney has said he’s very concerned about the surge in illegal marijuana farms in southern Oregon, and even suggested the Oregon National Guard be sent in to help, and so might favor legislation aimed at tackling the problem."}, {"title": "Virginia Senate Panel Rejects Trump EPA Chief For Top Virginia Environmental Post", "text": "Democratic state senators in Virginia took a first step Tuesday toward blocking Andrew Wheeler, Donald Trump’s controversial second head of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former coal lobbyist, from becoming the state’s top environmental official.A Senate committee that considers gubernatorial nominees voted 9-6 along party lines to remove Wheeler’s name from a resolution approving Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) Cabinet appointments.But, as The Virginian-Pilot reported, it may not be the end of the line for Wheeler’s nomination. His name could ultimately be added back to the resolution on the Senate floor. All it would take is a single Democrat in the narrowly divided state Senate voting with Republicans.Tuesday’s vote adds to what has proved to be a contentious confirmation process, in which scores of current and former EPA employees urged Virginia lawmakers to vote against Wheeler, citing his record of gutting environmental rules while at the helm of the federal agency.Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke called Wheeler’s nomination “dangerous for Virginia’s future.”“Governor Youngkin has said time and time again he would like to bridge the partisan divide and work together for Virginia’s next generation,” Locke said in a statement following the vote. “However, his choice of Trump alum Andrew Wheeler for the position of Secretary of Natural Resources proves his unwillingness to bring properly qualified officials into our government.”Youngkin tapped Wheeler to serve as his secretary of natural resources in January and, in the face of mounting public pressure, maintained he was “the most qualified person for this job.”Democrats, who hold a 21-19 majority in the state Senate, signaled last week that they were united in their opposition and had the votes to sink Wheeler’s nomination. But one member of the party, Sen. Joseph D. Morrissey, revived what seemed like a doomed nomination, telling The Washington Post after Wheeler’s appearance before a Senate committee last week that he was “very much open” to confirming Youngkin’s Cabinet pick.At that hearing, Wheeler defended his legacy and said he’d become a lightning rod because the press did not cover “positive things” during his tenure. He also blamed Congress for his own inaction on climate change, arguing he was “dealt a very limited hand” to confront the global threat since Congress hasn’t passed more stringent laws to curb greenhouse gas emissions.After listening to Wheeler’s testimony, Morrissey told the former EPA chief that he was “very articulate and persuasive.”Environmental groups accused Wheeler of trying to rewrite history.In Virginia, governors’ Cabinet nominees typically sail through confirmation. But Wheeler, who played an outsize role in the Trump administration’s industry-friendly deregulatory push, emerged as a uniquely controversial choice. More than 150 former EPA employees; dozens of environmental groups and AFGE Council 238, a union that represents more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, all sent letters calling for Virginia senators to oppose Youngkin’s choice.In response to mounting criticism, more than 130 of Wheeler’s former colleagues at EPA and elsewhere sent their own letter defending his record and dismissing previous letters as “highly biased and unsupported.”In a statement following Tuesday’s vote, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said the governor “is disappointed that the committee put partisan politics over the selection of an experienced public servant who would prioritize cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay and James River.”"}, {"title": "GOP Senate Hopeful: My Landscaping Means ‘I Do More For Climate Change Than Anyone’", "text": "Chuck Morse, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in New Hampshire, said owning a plant nursery and landscaping company means he has done “more for climate change than anyone,” despite a long record as a state lawmaker of opposing carbon-cutting policies.In a local television interview Sunday, Morse, the president of the New Hampshire state Senate, signaled his opposition to federal efforts to cut planet-heating pollution. He cast those who advocate for emissions cuts from the United States — which has cumulatively added more carbon to the atmosphere than any other country — as elitist hypocrites.“The part that bothers me most is these people that get on airplanes and fly on their little junkets and drink their wine and basically start to discuss how they’re going to change the world, and they do it only in the United States,” he told WMUR’s “CloseUp” program.By contrast, “I do more for climate change than anyone else out there,” said Morse, 61.“I mean, I own a nursery and garden center. I’ve been a landscaper,” he said. “I planted more trees than any of the candidates that are running together, you know, at any point in time.”Yet Morse, who hopes to take on Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in November, has routinely voted against measures to cut emissions during the nearly quarter-century he’s spent as a Granite State legislator.In 2020, he voted twice against net-metering policies to help provide financial incentives to utility ratepayers who produce their own clean electricity. In 2019, he opposed expanding protections for wetlands, came out against establishing a greenhouse gas rebate program, and voted down a bill to increase the state’s solar-energy targets. In 2011, he voted to withdraw New Hampshire from the regional cap-and-trade market, in which more than a dozen East Coast states set a limit on carbon emissions and allow companies to trade permits to pollute.“Senator Morse has a long voting record that contradicts his climate claims,” Catherine Corkery, the director of the Sierra Club’s New Hampshire chapter, said in an email. “He has adamantly opposed clean energy access and expansion. He has avoided addressing the climate crisis and the risks it presents to public health, infrastructure, and the underserved in the Granite State. That is a fact.”While newly planted trees do absorb carbon from the atmosphere, “a lot of landscaping comes from new construction, which involves clearing forest land, especially in northern New England,” said Jack Dibb, a tree farmer and research professor at the University of New Hampshire’s Earth Systems Research Center.“So the net is usually a lot less trees, and something way different than a healthy forest,” Dibb said over email. “Landscaping relatively small lots in a development really does not contribute in a significant way.”Morse did not respond to an email sent Monday night requesting comment.Morse is the third candidate to jump into the race against Hassan. National Republicans heavily recruited Gov. Chris Sununu to run. But in November, he held a press conference and surprised everyone by announcing that he instead was going to seek a fourth term as governor.Republicans see Hassan’s seat as a potential pickup opportunity in the tight battle for control of the Senate. Besides Morse, former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Gen. Don Bolduc are running for the GOP nomination."}, {"title": "Red States’ Wolf Decimation Campaign Hasn’t Worked", "text": "Idaho and Montana both passed controversial laws last year with the goal of sharply reducing their gray wolf populations. The Idaho law gained national attention over reports that the state aimed to eradicate up to 90% of its gray wolves.If that's the plan, it hasn’t worked yet.The number of gray wolves killed by hunters and trappers fell within the ranges documented for the last few years, according to data released by both states last week. Neither state showed an unusual spike in wolf deaths.In Montana, hunters and trappers have killed 189 wolves since the 2021-22 wolf-hunting season began — about average for this time of year. Idaho documented 300 wolf deaths by the end of December. That figure, which includes natural mortality and wolves killed for livestock predation, is higher than it was at the same time a year prior, but lower than in 2019.Idaho’s gray wolf population stood at 1,543 as of Aug. 1, according to a state estimate based on computer analysis of millions of trail camera images — about two dozen fewer wolves than at the same time in 2019.“We don’t know where it’s going to end up,” Idaho Fish and Game spokesperson Roger Phillips said. “There’s still plenty of hunting and trapping season out there. But so far, we’re not seeing it tracking differently than it has for previous years.”The Idaho legislature caused a major uproar last year by passing a law slashing restrictions on the state’s already-liberal regulations for hunting and trapping wolves. Hunters and trappers may now legally kill an unlimited number of wolves. They can hunt wolves at night and while using motor vehicles. The law allows the contracting of third parties to target wolves.Former wildlife officials criticized the legislature for usurping wildlife management from state agencies, while environmentalist and animal rights groups decried the law as an open wolf slaughter and urged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to put wolves in the Northern Rockies back under the protection of the Endangered Species Act.Montana also passed laws targeting wolves last year, though legislators left the state’s Fish, Wildlife and Parks agency largely in charge of regulating the wolf harvest, eliminating one of the Idaho law’s most contentious elements.Ranchers championed the Idaho bill, saying the growing wolf population was eating into their bottom line.Wolves kill only a small number of domestic cows each year. But in areas where they are present in large numbers, they tend to push and stress cattle herds, delaying their weight gain. Profit in cattle ranching depends on moving the livestock from birth- to slaughter-weight quickly.Nothing in the Idaho law specifies how many or what percentage of wolves hunters and trappers should kill.But Idaho agreed to maintain a minimum of 150 wolves when the federal government delisted wolves in the Northern Rockies from the Endangered Species Act. Critics who said the Idaho bill would result in the killing of 90% of the state’s wolves came up with that number by reasoning that 150 is 10% of the state’s total wolf population of 1,500.It takes more than legal changes, however, to kill that many wolves. Both states had already made it cheap for people to buy lots of the tags they needed to hunt or trap wolves, over lengthy seasons, especially on private land.But wolves roam huge swaths of unpopulated land in those states. They routinely cover distances of 20 miles, mostly at night. And the fur market doesn’t offer prices high enough to motivate significant numbers of people to specialize in trapping wolves. The result is that the vast majority of people who buy a tag allowing them to kill a wolf never fill it.While the Idaho law hasn’t yet decimated its wolf population, some of its backers view it as a minor victory that the state’s estimate shows the wolf population dropped by about two dozen in the last two years, after a period of rapid growth.“We are grateful to see that it’s declining slightly,” said Chyla Wilson, a spokesperson for the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, a major backer of the wolf bill. “It will be interesting to see where it goes in the next couple of years. We obviously don’t think the population will go down a substantial amount ― not even close to 90%. But we do want to see a slow decrease to reduce conflicts.”Last week’s numbers add a new dimension to the rekindled debate over whether the federal government should protect gray wolves in the Northern Rockies under the Endangered Species Act. USFWS is considering an emergency listing for gray wolves in Idaho and Montana, but will not likely rule for several months.Some suspect that the laws’ full effects remain unknown, partly due to harsh winter weather that might have kept some hunters and trappers from the field.“It’s extremely early to estimate how many wolves are going to be killed with these new laws in place,” said Andrea Zaccardi, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity. “The wolf killing numbers are still extremely high. They were high before these laws and I think they’ll remain high and even be higher.”While Montana’s overall wolf population didn’t nosedive, the new laws profoundly affected wolf populations near Yellowstone National Park.Montana wildlife officials had previously imposed a hunting quota of one wolf in each of the two hunting units where most of the park’s wolves have historically gotten killed. After the legal changes, the state replaced the unit-based quotas with a region-wide target of 82 wolves.That change hammered Yellowstone wolves. Hunters and trappers killed a total of 23 wolves on Yellowstone’s borders, reducing the park’s wolf population by 20% and eliminating one of its packs.Montana’s wildlife commission voted 7-0 on Friday to keep the hunting season open until meeting the 82-wolf threshold, over the objections of Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cameron Sholly.Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) also killed a Yellowstone wolf in February of last year, though that was before the legal changes and before the current hunting and trapping season began. Gianforte received a reprimand from a state agency he oversees for failing to complete a required course before doing so.A combination of commercialized hunting and government poisoning campaigns to protect livestock eradicated gray wolves from the West by the early 20th century. Yellowstone National Park served as the main site of their reintroduction to the Northern Rockies in 1995.The park does not permit hunting, and wolves have flourished there. Visitors hope to see them, and people have followed the wolves’ lives from afar through the animals’ biologist-assigned numbers.Park officials called the wolf deaths “a significant setback for the species’ long-term viability and for wolf research” in a statement to The Associated Press."}, {"title": "Dolce & Gabbana Will Drop Animal Fur Starting In 2022", "text": "MILAN (AP) — Dolce & Gabbana announced Monday that it would drop the use of animal fur in all its collections starting this year, and transition to eco-friendly faux fur.The Milan fashion house joins other luxury brands, including Armani, Gucci, Prada and Moncler, in adhering to guidelines set by the Fur Free Alliance, a network of animal rights groups around the world.“Dolce & Gabbana is working toward a more sustainable future that can’t contemplate the use of animal fur,” Dolce & Gabbana communications and marketing officer Fedele Usai said in a statement.PJ Smith, the fashion policy director of the Human Society of the United States and the Humane Society International, said “ending the use of fur creates a higher standard for what is acceptable in fashion.”Italy has banned fur farming from this year, joining about 20 countries that have either banned or limited fur farming over the last two decades."}, {"title": "Male Penguin Couple Doing 'Great Job' Raising Foster Hatchling, New York Zoo Says", "text": "Two male Humboldt penguins at a New York zoo who adopted an egg last year have become parents to a brand-new hatchling.The same-sex foster couple, Elmer and Lima, are a first for the Rosamond Gifford Zoo, which is based in Syracuse, though a number of other zoos around the world have also had same-sex penguins successfully incubate eggs and raise chicks.The Rosamond Gifford Zoo said on its website that it has had at least two breeding pairs of penguins accidentally break their fertilized eggs in the past. To improve the chances of hatching a chick, zookeepers may give an egg to a more successful pair.Zoo Director Ted Fox said that not all penguin pairs are good at incubating eggs: “It takes practice.”Elmer and Lima were given a dummy egg last year and “were exemplary in every aspect of egg care,” Fox said. That prompted zookeepers to give them an egg laid by another couple before Christmas.The penguin dads took turns incubating the egg until it hatched on New Year’s Day. They’ve been warming and feeding the chick ever since.“It continues to be brooded and cared for by both Elmer and Lima, who are doing a great job. And once they have experience doing this and continue to do it well, they will be considered to foster future eggs,” Fox said.Many other institutions have had good experiences with same-sex penguin foster couples in recent years. These include Electra and Viola, two female gentoo penguins at the Oceanogràfic València aquarium in Spain; Skipper and Ping, a pair of male king penguins at the Berlin Zoo; and Eduardo and Rio, both male Magellanic penguins, at the San Francisco Zoo.Fox said these examples show that the idea of “family” is not dependent on species and that many different kinds of families thrive at raising children."}, {"title": "Winter Weather Disappears From Winter Olympics And Athletes Worry", "text": "Ski racers settling into the start gate for Alpine World Cup events in the Rocky Mountains in early December squinted through sunshine that carried the temperature toward 50 degrees and glanced down at a course covered with pristine — and manufactured — snow.If they looked up and across the way, beyond the finish line, they saw adjacent hills that were brown and barren as can be, with nary a trace of powder or any indication that this was a setting for athletes who would be heading to the Beijing Olympics that begin Feb. 4.It is a troubling reality and — given their own reliance on the production of snow, continent-hopping flights powered by diesel fuel and other environment-unfriendly offshoots of their careers — hard-to-reconcile push-and-pull for many of those who will be competing in Alpine skiing or freestyle skiing or snowboarding or Nordic combined events or other outdoor sports that helped put the disappearing “Winter” in Winter Games.“Climate change is here. It’s happening. We’re living in it right now. It’s not something that’s going to be in the distant future. It’s here. And you see it with the fires in California, floods in Europe, higher snow levels, shorter winters, longer summers, droughts. It runs the whole gamut. Everywhere in the world is having some effect from it. And there’s not really any turning back,” said Travis Ganong, a 33-year-old from California going to China with the U.S. ski team.“Selfishly, I hope winters are here in the future,” he said. “But it’s not looking good.”Global warming is altering, and endangering, his and other sports, perhaps permanently, and not just at the elite level. It affects folks who just want to ski or snowboard for fun and those who make a living from places offering such activities.And, well, everyone on the planet, of course, because this affects far more than sports, of course.Just one example: In December, Colorado set a record that stood since the 1880s for most consecutive days without snow. After warm temperatures and just an inch of snowfall by Dec. 30, wind-fueled wildfires destroyed hundreds of homes in the state.The last eight years rank as the eight hottest on record for Earth, according to two U.S. science agencies, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“The glaciers are receding. The winter is starting later and ending sooner,” said John Kucera, the 2009 world champion in downhill who now is a coach for Canada’s Alpine team. “For a sport like ours, we might pay for it sooner than some others. We are dependent on the climate and the weather and that dictates what we’re able to do.”The fallout is widespread.It’s harder to find glaciers suitable for training, so athletes need to search for new locales — or even head indoors. It’s harder to hold World Cup events, because too much wind or too much snow or too little snow leads to postponements or cancellations.It’s harder to find real snow anywhere, so competition increasingly comes on machine-made snow, which has its own deleterious effects on the environment. While the high speeds, steep inclines and sharp angles make danger a constant presence in Alpine skiing, no matter what sort of stuff is underfoot, injury-causing crashes are increasingly common in Nordic skiing and biathlon because the snow created by people produces harder, slicker tracks.“We definitely have noticed a lack of snow everywhere. Places that, in December, November, used to be ‘winter wonderlands,’ we’re seeing them with less and less snow. And some years, they’re not getting any snow,” said Taylor Fletcher, who grew up in Colorado, is based in Utah, and made his fourth Olympic team in Nordic combined.Plenty of Winter Olympians share similar observations.“I’m no meteorologist,” Italy’s Marta Bassino, last season’s World Cup giant slalom discipline winner, said with a chuckle, “but I see it with my eyes.”Alexis Pinturault, a three-time Olympic medalist for France, recalls hitting the slopes at Tignes in his country’s Alps 20 years ago, but notes “it’s nearly impossible to ski there anymore.” U.S. aerials skier Winter Vinecki remembers an event in Belarus where, instead of a season-appropriate setting, she competed amid water puddles. Explains Taylor Gold, an American snowboarder who is part of Protect Our Winters, an athlete-driven environmental group: “The absolute ideal scenario would be to have a halfpipe made entirely of natural snow, but that’s just never possible anymore.”A study recently published in “Current Issues in Tourism” projected that without a dramatic reduction of global emissions of greenhouse gases, only one of the previous 21 Winter Olympics sites would be able to reliably provide fair and safe conditions by the end of this century.Researchers from Austria, Canada and the U.S. determined that even with emissions on the lower end of the scale, just three of 12 European cities that have hosted Winter Games would be a reliable site by the 2050s.“Part of what we do papers like this for is to get the message out that we have a large influence ... and so, if we act, (there is) hope of avoiding those worst-case scenarios,” said Daniel Scott, a professor at the University of Waterloo who co-authored the study, “Climate change and the future of the Olympic Winter Games: athlete and coach perspectives.”"}, {"title": "'Mr. Goodbar' Mexican Gray Wolf Thwarted By Trump's Border Wall Is Shot", "text": "A young Mexican gray wolf recently thwarted in his search for a mate by Donald Trump’s border wall has been shot, researchers have reported.The 2-year-old male, known to scientists as “Mr. Goodbar,” is expected to live but will likely have all or part of his right hind leg amputated, according to a statement from the nonprofit conservation organization the Center for Biological Diversity.An investigation has been launched to track Mr. Goodbar’s shooter. Mexican gray wolves are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. The maximum penalty for violating the law is a year in jail and a $50,000 fine.“Mr. Goodbar’s painful experiences illustrate the inhospitable world we’ve created for Mexican gray wolves and other vulnerable animals,” Michael Robinson, a senior conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “We hope the criminal who shot Mr. Goodbar will be brought to justice.”Mr. Goodbar’s injury was spotted during an annual count by helicopter of the Mexican gray wolves in the Southwest by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.He was tranquilized with a dart fired from a helicopter and transported for treatment to the Albuquerque BioPark Zoo, the Center for Biological Diversity reported.He made news earlier this month as the first tracked wolf to prove the Trump border wall is creating a problem for endangered species. Mr. Goodbar left his pack in eastern Arizona last year and roamed for months to strike out on his own to start his own family in new territory. He was finally stopped in southern New Mexico in late November — not by the challenges of the Chihuahuan Desert, but by Trump’s 30-foot-high border barrier.The young wolf trotted along the wall for days, likely looking for an opening, which would have provided the possibility of mating with Mexican gray wolves on the other side of the border. But he finally turned back north again, and ended up close to his old territory.The Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups are now battling to open up the border wall in “priority” areas identified as important for animals — not just wolves, but for pronghorn, cougars, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, bobcats, mule deer, kit fox and ringtail.The reintroduced Mexican gray wolf population numbered some 186 in Arizona and New Mexico in the last count in 2020 (there were 30 across the border in Mexico).This year, the tally will likely be higher, Robinson said. But the species risks extinction by inbreeding without more genetic diversity, which requires large swaths of unimpeded range for the animals to branch out.“These wolves are beautiful, intelligent, social animals that we should want to save just because of empathy,” Robinson told HuffPost. “And because we played a role in their decimation, we have an obligation to help them.”"}, {"title": "It Turns Out Orcas Can — And Do — Kill And Eat Blue Whales", "text": "Its sheer size apparently isn’t enough to save a blue whale from becoming dinner for a hungry pod of orcas (aka killer whales).In a paper published last week in the journal Marine Mammal Science, researchers shared “the first documentation of killer whales killing and eating blue whales: two individuals killed, 16 days apart in 2019, and a third in 2021.”In the past, there have been reports of orcas chasing blue whales, but this the first official scientific record of orcas successfully hunting, killing and eating them, according to The Guardian.The incidents all happened in Australia’s Bremer Bay, where female-led orca groups worked together to take down their large prey.In two of the three cases, the blue whales — which are the largest animals on Earth — weren’t fully grown: one was a young calf and one was a juvenile around a year old. But the third blue whale the orcas ate was a healthy adult between 60 and 70 feet long, more than twice the size of the largest orcas, which only get to be about 30 feet, according to National Geographic.“When we arrived about 14 killer whales were attacking the blue in [230-ft deep] waters, with the female killer whales leading the attack,” Isabella Reeves, a PhD candidate at Australia’s Flinders University and one of the study’s authors, told New Atlas.That attack involved some of the orcas repeatedly slamming into the blue whale and biting off chunks of its flesh, while others went for its head and still another took the liberty of going for the tongue ― a nutrient-dense organ that orcas apparently love. Ultimately, about 50 orcas joined in the smorgasbord.While you may have trouble convincing a blue whale of this, the researchers believe that the orca attacks may actually be a positive sign overall, indicating that blue whale numbers are rebounding after being driven to near-extinction by the whaling industry in the early 20th century.“Maybe what we’re starting to see now is how the ocean used to be before we took out most of the large whales,” Robert Pitman, an ecologist at Oregon State University and another of the study’s authors, told The Guardian. “As some of these populations continue to recover, we have a better chance to see how normal marine ecosystems function.”In the meantime, orcas aren’t the only animals enjoying the feast, Gizmodo reported. In the case of the adult whale, the carcass also became a buffet for sharks and scavenging seabirds."}, {"title": "Coal-Loving Australia’s Pledge To Protect Great Barrier Reef ‘Utter Bulls**t,’ Detractors Say", "text": "The Australian government on Friday said it would invest $700 million to protect the Great Barrier Reef, a natural crown jewel rapidly deteriorating due to climate change, but the plan prompted swift backlash from scientists and environmentalists who say the effort does little to address our warming world.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the new funding would be spent over the next nine years, bolstering a $1.4 billion effort, called the Reef 2050 Plan, through investments that would improve water quality, tackle outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish and invest in reef science.But the plan barely addresses the root cause of the Great Barrier Reef’s demise: Quickly warming waters linked to climate change. The landmark has been hit by five bouts of mass coral bleaching since 1998, including back-to-back events in 2016, 2017 and 2020 that left huge swaths of the structure sickened or dead.(Bleaching happens most often when warmer-than-usual waters sit atop delicate reefs, effectively cooking coral polyps.)Terry Hughes, a professor at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said the plan amounted to “utter bullshit,” calling it merely a Band-Aid “to protect fossil fuels.”“Australia is a laggard on climate change — still encouraging more fossil fuels, and scientists know that we CAN’T ‘build a healthy resilient reef in the face of climate change’ without tackling rising emissions,” he wrote on Twitter.Australia’s conservative government has drawn fierce criticism for its ongoing support of the fossil fuel industry, and a November report found 116 major coal and gas projects are in development across the country. The nation’s emissions strategies are currently ranked as “highly insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker, and Morrison has refused to update 2030 emissions reduction targets and vowed to support the coal industry for “decades to come.”“I make no apologies for Australia’s standing up for our national interests, whether they be our security interests or economic interests,” Morrison, who faces an election later this year, said in November at the United Nations’ climate conference in Glasgow. “We have a balanced plan to achieve net zero by 2050, but we’re not going to make rural and regional Australians pay for that.”Many scientists argue, however, that 2050 will be far too late to stop runaway climate change, especially for already vulnerable structures like the Great Barrier Reef. Reef advocates also point to the 64,000 jobs supported directly by tourism along the Australian coastline.(The $1 billion figure referenced in the tweets below is in Australian dollars.)Sussan Ley, the country’s environment minister, said Friday that Australia isn’t “sitting on our hands” when it comes to addressing climate change, and she pushed back on concerns that the nation wasn’t doing its fair share to address fossil fuel emissions.“Our focus for improving the long-term outlook of the reef is on three key areas, one of them is global emissions reductions... but of course it’s a global issue requiring a global response,” she said. Ley went on to say that critics try to claim “Australia’s emissions are the only emissions responsible for the state of the reef, and that’s clearly not the case.”“We know that we can help build a healthy, resilient reef in the face of climate change while playing our part.”Those statements were met with frustration from opposition lawmakers, who linked aggressive action on climate change to true protection for the reef.The damage and ongoing threats to the reef are so great that UNESCO, the United Nations body that monitors the world’s areas of great significance, threatened to downgrade the Great Barrier Reef to “in danger” status. Doing so would have been deeply embarrassing, but the Australian government successfully lobbied to prevent it from happening in the short term.A vote on the matter will be held later this year, after the Australian federal election."}, {"title": "Court Cancels Biden Administration's 'Carbon Bomb' Oil Lease Sale", "text": "A federal judge on Thursday vacated dozens of oil and gas leases that fossil fuel companies secured late last year in the Gulf of Mexico, concluding that the Biden administration failed to properly account for climate effects when it held its massive offshore auction.The ruling is a major win for environmental groups that sued to block what many described as a ticking “carbon bomb.”Judge Rudolph Contreras, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, sided with plaintiffs in the case, who argued that the Department of the Interior relied on a faulty analysis that underestimated the planet-warming greenhouse gases and associated environmental effects from future drilling and development of the leases.Interior “acted arbitrarily and capriciously in excluding foreign consumption from their greenhouse gas emissions calculation,” Contreras wrote.The offshore sale — the largest in U.S. history — offered up more than 80 million acres of the Gulf at auction. Companies ultimately bid more than $191 million for rights to drill across more than 1.7 million offshore acres — an area larger than the state of Delaware.“We are pleased that the court invalidated Interior’s illegal lease sale,” Brettny Hardy, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, which represented several environmental organizations in the lawsuit, said in a statement. “We simply cannot continue to make investments in the fossil fuel industry to the peril of our communities and increasingly warming planet.”Hardy added it is time for the administration to follow through on President Joe Biden’s campaign promises to ban new federal fossil-fuel leasing. “We can no longer afford to do anything less,” she said.The Biden administration has argued it had no choice but to move forward with the offshore sale after a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana struck down Biden’s executive order in January 2021 temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters.But environmental lawyers insisted that the administration had options for scaling back, delaying or halting it, including requesting that an appeals court stay — or suspend — the injunction.Melissa Schwartz, a spokesperson for the Interior Department, reiterated that the administration’s hands were tied.“To comply with the injunction imposed in the District Court of Louisiana litigation, we were compelled to proceed with Lease Sale 257 based on the previous administration’s environmental analysis and its decision to approve the lease sale,” she said via email. “We are reviewing the Court’s decision concerning deficiencies in that record.“Our public lands and waters must be protected for generations to come,” she added. “We have documented serious deficiencies in the federal oil and gas program. Especially in the face of the climate crisis, we need to take the time to make significant and long overdue programmatic reforms. Our work will be guided by the law, science and sound policy.”The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil and gas lobby and an intervening defendant in the case, called the judge’s decision “disappointing” and said it is considering its options.“Offshore energy development plays a critical role in strengthening our nation’s economy and energy security,” API spokesperson Scott Lauermann said via email.The now-revoked lease sale dwarfed the Trump administration’s final Gulf auction in 2020, when 518,000 acres went for $121 million, and threatened to lock in decades of future drilling and greenhouse gas emissions. By Interior’s own estimates, it was expected to lead to the production of an additional 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over several decades.“Today’s decision is a victorious outcome not only for the Gulf’s communities, wildlife, and ecosystem, but also for the warming planet,” Hallie Templeton, legal director at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement."}, {"title": "Ozzie, World's Oldest Male Gorilla, Dies At Atlanta Zoo At Age Of 61", "text": "ATLANTA, Ga.

Ozzie was 61.The cause of the gorilla’s death was not immediately known though Ozzie began showing signs of low appetite last week, the zoo said in a news release. The zoo’s veterinary team treated Ozzie for symptoms including facial swelling, weakness and inability to eat or drink fluids.Ozzie, a lowland gorilla, was the world’s oldest male gorilla and the third-oldest gorilla in the world.“This is a devastating loss for Zoo Atlanta,” said Raymond Kind, president and CEO of the zoo. “Ozzie’s life’s contributions are indelible, in the generations of individuals he leaves behind in the gorilla population and in the world’s body of knowledge in the care of his species.”A necropsy will be performed by the University of Georgia Zoo and Exotic Animal Pathology Service in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the news release said.Ozzie was the only surviving member of a generation brought to Zoo Atlanta with the opening of The Ford African Rain Forest in 1988. He became the world’s first gorilla in the world to participate in a voluntary blood pressure reading in 2009.The primate is survived by seven descendants at the Atlanta zoo and many other offspring at other zoos in the United States and Canada, the news release stated.Lowland gorillas are considered critically endangered because of poaching, habitat loss, and drastic population reductions from disease.

The IOC also noted that chemical additives are only being used to make snow in one of the four venues; the other three are sufficiently cold to naturally keep the snow from melting.Past Winter Olympics have struggled with less-than-ideal conditions as well, but never to this extent. A Bloomberg report found that 80% of the snow at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia, was man-made, and that 90% of the white stuff in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was fake. But both regions receive significantly more yearly precipitation than Beijing.Absent urgent steps to reverse climate change, we should expect winter sports to look more like this in the future, according to a report published Wednesday by an environmental group called Sport Ecology Group at Loughborough University in England and Protect Our Winters.Only 10 of the 21 venues used for the Winter Games since 1924 will have the “climate suitability” and snowfall levels necessary to host by 2050, the authors concluded.Snowmaking technology can be a useful stopgap, but it’s no substitute for the real thing, Peter Speight, a British freestyle champion and Winter Olympian, told the report’s authors.“It’s helpful for creating physical snow for people to use, but it uses large amounts of water and energy and does not help solve climate change,” Speight said. “We need to solve climate change at the source (reduce greenhouse gas emissions), rather than rely on mitigation focused solutions.”"}, {"title": "Leopard vs. Porcupine Showdown Does Not End Well For One Of Them", "text": "Curiosity quilled the cat.A young leopard hunting a porcupine in South Africa tried to play it cool, but got too aggressive and paid the price.

One of them was now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), whose successful grassroots campaign shook up the political landscape and put the party’s old guard on notice.As Lears was wrapping up the film, 2019’s “Knock Down the House,” she knew she wanted to keep following Ocasio-Cortez. Around that same time, in the fall of 2018, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its most sobering report yet, warning that world leaders were rapidly running out of time to prevent environmental catastrophe.So Lears turned her attention toward the politics of climate change, following Ocasio-Cortez as well as three Green New Deal activists and progressive leaders: Varshini Prakash of the Sunrise Movement, Alexandra Rojas of Justice Democrats and Rhiana Gunn-Wright of the Roosevelt Institute. The result is “To the End,” which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival.In a conversation with HuffPost, Lears talked about the significance of all four of the documentary’s protagonists being young women of color, how the COVID-19 pandemic made the themes even more grimly resonant, and why the activists maintain optimism and momentum in the face of so much defeat, intransigence, and being continually underestimated.After completing “Knock Down the House,” Lears said she wanted to continue exploring women and women of color in leadership. In particular, it became clear these new generations of leaders would come up against the tension of “how you leverage the power that you have while trying to build more at the same time, and confronting what the limits of the power that you have,” she said.“I was very interested in what it was going to look like, not only for Ocasio-Cortez to enter Congress and confront the realities of whatever she was going to find there in the institutions of our government,” Lears explained.“But once the Green New Deal started exploding, it also became clear that these other young women who are in positions of leadership in this movement were also going to be facing a similar challenge around leadership and power, and just what is it like to have one foot in the door of the halls of power, but not to have enough power to fully shape your own agenda.”In addition, as Lears pointed out, it’s “not a coincidence that these four leaders and many young leaders in the climate justice movement are women of color.”“Young people, women and people of color are, across the world, the most affected by the climate crisis at the front lines,” she said. “Women of color have been leading movements as long as there have been movements, but they don’t always get memorialized in the official histories. And that’s starting to change, obviously, but it’s incredibly important to recognize the work that these people are doing and to acknowledge their central role in this.”Lears’ prior film “Knock Down the House” was similarly noteworthy in how, unlike many campaign documentaries, its subjects were women and women of color. For the filmmaker, there are multiple reasons why this matters. On one level, it’s powerful and meaningful for people to see themselves represented.“On the other hand, I also think there’s a really interesting cultural shift that happens when people from dominant groups start to identify with people from marginalized groups as characters, because that’s the opposite of what I grew up with, identifying with male characters in movies and television because there just weren’t enough female characters,” she said.“So I’m trying to make movies that are constructed in a way to really draw people into empathy and identifying with this character-based narrative journey. And I think that can have really profound cultural implications when it’s cast this way.”The events in “To the End” span the last three years. Like everything else in the world, the COVID-19 pandemic presented a lot of logistical challenges for Lears, the documentary’s protagonists and the production team. At the same time, she discovered that narratively, the pandemic was all a “massive validation of the themes that we had already been exploring.”“We had already been exploring the way that crises play out along the lines of economic and racial inequality,” Lears said. “Boom, the pandemic hits. And that is just blatantly obvious to everyone that that’s what is happening.”One of the film’s major storylines is the push and pull between activists and elected officials. The activists recognize they’re dealing with a deeply flawed political system, but also understand the need to work within it in order to achieve real change. And Ocasio-Cortez plays a crucial role as a liaison between the activists and the old guard Democratic leaders.“To actually get what we demand requires us to work with institutions and established powers that we loathe,” Ocasio-Cortez says in the film. “Sometimes, I feel like my job is to get my hands dirty so that community organizers and activists don’t have to.”In another scene, Prakash similarly reflects on how it can be “too icky” to deal with flawed and corrupt institutions, and whether to engage with political power is a source of debate within the progressive movement.But “as mind-blowingly frustrating as it can be,” Lears said, there’s still a need to do so.“At the end of the day, we need both. We need electoral movements and community-based movements and labor movements,” she said. “Electoral politics isn’t the only arena for deciding these things. But it is important. And as Varshini says, our enemy, and she’s talking about the fossil fuel industry, is working out their political strategy and spending billions of dollars on it.”The documentary tells a compelling story about the challenges of progressive organizing and trying to remain steadfast when it’s hard not to feel cynical and demoralized. But as the climate crisis has grown direr and more people experience the effects of rising sea levels, worsening air and water pollution, and intensifying natural disasters, “we don’t have the luxury of cynicism,” Lears said. It’s something that clearly drives the protagonists in “To the End.”“That sort of visceral distaste for politics, I think it’s connected to the cynicism that so many people feel when they watch the gridlock and just the way that so many people in Congress will prioritize their donors or corporate interests above what the majority of working people in this country actually want to see,” Lears said.“I can see why people feel distaste for that. I do myself. But it’s really interesting to follow the story of people who are trying to walk that line and trying to stay true to their values while engaging within the system. And all of the people featured in this film are; they get tons of flack, literally from left, right and center.”“They’re being criticized from people on all parts of the political spectrum for being too much of this, too little of that. But they’re trying to be idealistic and pragmatic at the same time,” Lears continued. “I think watching these courageous young women really live through that is an incredibly emotional roller coaster.”"}, {"title": "Rihanna’s Foundation Donates $15 Million To Climate Justice", "text": "Rihanna is backing her belief that climate change is a social-justice issue by pledging $15 million to the movement through her Clara Lionel Foundation.The “We Found Love” singer on Tuesday announced the donation to 18 climate justice organizations doing work in seven Caribbean nations and the United States.They include the Climate Justice Alliance, the Indigenous Environmental Network, and the Movement for Black Lives.“Climate disasters, which are growing in frequency and intensity, do not impact all communities equally, with communities of color and island nations facing the brunt of climate change,” Rihanna, who is from the eastern Caribbean island of Barbados, said in a statement.She noted that disparity is the reason her foundation, which is named after her grandparents, prioritizes both climate resilience and climate justice work.The grants, made in partnership with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s #StartSmall philanthropic initiative, are focused on groups with female, LGBT, and Black and Indigenous leaders because their communities are at the greatest risk.“Funders must build partnerships with grassroots organizations, acknowledging their deep understanding of what is necessary to achieve climate justice in their own communities,” Justine Lucas, Clara Lionel Foundation’s executive director, said in a statement."}, {"title": "Endangered Wolf Thwarted In Love By Donald Trump's Border Wall", "text": "A lone endangered Mexican gray wolf likely seeking a mate has been thwarted by American politics — in the form of Donald Trump’s massive border wall.The male wolf, known as Mr. Goodbar to researchers, left his pack in eastern Arizona and roamed for months in a drive to start his own family. He was finally stopped in southern New Mexico in late November — not by the challenges of the Chihuahuan Desert, but by a 30-foot-high border barrier.Before Trump launched his wall campaign, the area was unbroken habitat, according to wildlife experts. Still, Mr. Goodbar sought an opening, and spent days trotting 23 miles along the wall, likely seeking a spot where he could resume his travels south. He eventually gave up and headed back north close to his old territory.His challenges were tracked by a GPS collar attached by staffers of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, providing some of the first concrete proof of border wall wildlife dangers that environmentalists had feared.“I wasn’t surprised because we had predicted it,” Michael Robinson, a senior conservation advocate for the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, told the National Geographic magazine this week. “But I was bummed out.”Mr. Goodbar is just one animal, but the border wall poses a challenge to countless other wolves — as well as to pronghorn, cougars, bighorn sheep, mountain lions, bobcats, mule deer, kit fox and ringtail.Fish and Wildlife Service officials insist the wall isn’t that big a deal for animals. But many wildlife experts say that a free range, allowing mating between different groups of animals, is crucial to genetic diversity.In the case of Mr. Goodbar, the border wall is “placing the recovery of an endangered species at risk,” said Myles Traphagen, a biologist with the Wildlands Network.The Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups are battling to open up the border wall in “priority” areas identified as important for animals.Robinson questions the value of a barrier to stop immigrants in areas that are largely in the middle of nowhere, like the spot where Mr. Goodbar was thwarted. U.S. agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service, he said, defend wrongheaded Trump policies and often serve the interests of the agricultural industry.The reintroduced Mexican gray wolf population numbered some 186 in Arizona and New Mexico in the last count in 2020 (there were 30 across the border in Mexico).This year, the tally could be higher, Robinson said. But the species will likely be doomed by inbreeding without more genetic diversity, which requires large swaths of unimpeded range for the animals to branch out.“These wolves are beautiful, intelligent, social animals that we should want to save just because of empathy,” Robinson told HuffPost. “And because we played a role in their decimation, we have an obligation to help them.”Wolves play a crucial role at the “center of the ecological system,” Robinson added. They cull prey animals that are injured, weakened or sick, and they keep larger animals like elk moving so they don’t wipe out large areas of vegetation that other species depend on. Wolves also leave food behind to be scavenged by species like rare wolverines.But “time is running out” to save the wolves, Robinson warned.“President Biden should knock down the wall,” he said. “Allowing Mexican gray wolves to roam freely would do right by the sublime Chihuahuan Desert and its sky-island mountains. We can’t allow [the wall], this stark monument to stupidity, to slowly strangle a vast ecosystem.”"}, {"title": "How To Reduce Food Waste By Composting And What You Need To Start", "text": "Starting this year, homes and business across the state of California will need to rethink the concept of food waste and the impact excess scraps have on the environment. In an effort to reduce the amount of materials going into landfills, a new California policy, which will take full effect by 2024, will require residents to collect their food scraps together along with their yard trimmings and place them into curbside collection bins used for composting.Robert Reed works with Recology, the San Francisco based waste management company responsible for heading California’s composting efforts. He told HuffPost the policy is an important step in sustainability and preservation because composting is equally and possible more beneficial than traditional recycling in our efforts to help protect the environment.″[It] saves landfill space and reduces greenhouse gases,” he added.In fact, “landfills are responsible for 12% of the global methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that is 34% more potent than CO2,” according to Seema Prabhu, program director of Trash Hero, an organization aimed at achieving a zero-waste future,Reed also noted composting has a direct effect in preserving precious top soils needed for water conservation, growing vegetation, protecting vital bee populations and even reducing wild fire risk.It’s not just California taking note of the benefits of composting. According to Reed, states like Vermont have already implemented similar measures along with over 150 cities and dozens of universities.You don’t have to give away your food scraps in municipals bins, however. With the help of at-home composting systems, you can give new life to all organic matter, from discarded banana peels to used coffee grounds, eggshells and apple cores.Using either electrical, outdoor or vermicomposting methods, you can break down food scraps into usable matter in the form of liquid (compost tea or bokashi, a Japanese term for fermented organic matter) and dry substances in order to create nutrient-rich fertilizer ideal for personal plants or community green spaces.Electrical indoor composters use heat and grinding elements to rapidly break down scraps, while vermicomposting utilizes worms to decompose vegetation, creating a byproduct called worm castings that makes a healthy soil additive filled with diverse microorganisms. Outdoor methods usually involve a vessel that traps heat to break down food scraps without the need for worms, however, both vermicomposting and outdoor non-electric composting can take up to six months to create a fertilizer.Even if you’re a city dweller with little access to green spaces, Prabhu said, at-home composting systems can still be a viable and easy option.“If you have a balcony, you can also grow your own veggies or herbs in a mix of compost, diluted bokashi and soil, which is not only satisfying but a great way to reduce the distance between your food and your table,” Prabhu said.The impact of composting goes much further when it comes to eliminating global waste as a whole.“We often see that once people start separating their trash, they become more aware of their consumption habits. It becomes obvious to them how much they are throwing away, both food and other items like packaging, and they naturally begin to develop habits to reduce this amount ― the ultimate goal,” Prabhu said.Whether you want start collecting your food scraps or create nutritious soil for your community garden, there are accessible means of composting that work for every budget and location. Read the list below to see a few main at-home composting systems as well what you will need to do in order to maintain them.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Glenn Youngkin (R) announced earlier this month that he had picked Wheeler for secretary of natural resources, a choice that enraged Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups.Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority in the Virginia Senate, meaning a party-line vote would sink Wheeler’s nomination. If a single Democrat supports Wheeler, however, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, would cast the tiebreaking vote.State Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D) is chair of the committee that considers gubernatorial nominees and submits resolutions confirming their appointment. In a statement late last week, he noted that he expects Wheeler’s nomination to be rejected.“I think the Democratic caucus is pretty united,” Deeds told HuffPost on Monday.Along with fielding phone calls from concerned constituents, Deeds said he and his colleagues read with interest a detailed letter from more than 150 former EPA employees sent earlier this month. In it, the group detailed much of Wheeler’s record at the agency and accused him of having “pursued an extremist approach, methodically weakening EPA’s ability to protect public health and the environment, instead favoring polluters.”“They provided a lot of information that I don’t know how you can rebut,” Deeds said. “Now, Wheeler tells me he can rebut it, that it’s not true. I assume he’s talking to the various Democratic members, that’s what I suggested to do. Everybody is an independent thinker.”Deeds and Wheeler spoke by phone shortly after his nomination and the two later met in Deeds’ office, the state senator said. On both occasions, Deeds told the former Trump official that he expected Democrats to vote down his nomination, he said.“I believe in working with the governor and working with the House where we can,” Deeds said. “Where we can’t, we’re going to stand firm on our ground. We’re not planning on going back on anything, and this nomination would be a step back.”Several other Democratic state senators, including some of the caucus’ more moderate members, have voiced concern about Wheeler or outright opposition to him. And like Deeds, some have expressed confidence that they will succeed in defeating the nomination.“We do,” state Sen. Joe Morrissey (D) told The Hill when asked if his party had enough votes to block Wheeler.In Virginia, governors’ cabinet picks typically sail through confirmation. The last time the Virginia General Assembly blocked a nomination was in 2006, when Republicans rejected Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine’s nomination of Daniel LeBlanc to serve as secretary of the commonwealth, as The New York Times reported.Wheeler ― fresh off his tenure in the Trump administration, where he played a key role in rolling back various climate and environmental rules ― has proven to be a particularly contentious choice for a powerful state environmental position. As HuffPost first reported last week, numerous current EPA staffers have come out forcefully against their old boss.Marie Owens Powell, president of the AFGE Council 238, a union that represents more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, wrote that Wheeler “destroyed or weakened dozens of environmental safeguards at EPA, with the sole intention of bolstering polluting industries’ profit margins.”“We believe he will do so again if you confirm his nomination,” Owens Powell wrote to Virginia state senators.Youngkin’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Last week, the governor’s office referred HuffPost to a previous interview Youngkin did with WTVR-TV in Richmond, in which he called Wheeler “the most qualified person for this job.”"}, {"title": "Experts Have 'Fingers Crossed' For Survival Of Rare Elephant Twins", "text": "Wildlife experts are cautiously hopeful following the birth of elephant twins at a reserve in Kenya.The two babies, a male and female, were born this week at Samburu National Reserve to a mother named Bora, the nonprofit Save the Elephants announced. The charity’s elephant researchers work within the park and it also trains guides to help monitor the animals.“Twins are rarely encountered in elephant populations — and form around only 1% of births,” zoologist and Save the Elephants founder Iain Douglas-Hamilton said in a statement. “Quite often the mothers don’t have enough milk to support two calves.”The quality of vegetation available for the mother elephant to eat, as well as the mother’s experience, are both big factors in the potential survival of a pair of twins, according to an Instagram post from the nonprofit. In this case, Bora has successfully already raised one calf that was born in 2017. Researchers with the charity plan to pay close attention to the elephant family and monitor the young elephants’ health.“The next few days will be touch and go for the new twins but we all have our fingers crossed for their survival,” Douglas-Hamilton said.African elephants are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with the biggest threats being poaching and habitat loss."}, {"title": "'Penguin Cam' Will Take You On A Soothing Dive Through A Cloud Of Sardines", "text": "Do you ever wish you could just be a penguin — sliding in the snow, diving among the fish, and maybe occasionally getting embroiled in a brutal love triangle?Whether or not you’ve ever had that oddly specific dream, you can now get a sneak peek into the penguin experience via “penguin cam:” footage from a special camera that researchers temporarily fitted on a foraging gentoo penguin in Argentina’s Beagle Channel.“We attached the device just for one foraging trip, and upon the penguin’s return we unattached the device and monitored the breeding success of the nest,” Andrea Raya Rey, associate researcher at Wildlife Conservation Society Argentina, said in a news release. “The Gentoo continued with its parental duties and taking care of the offspring.”The resulting video provides a penguin’s-eye-view of swimming straight into a large and presumably delicious school of sardines.Gentoo penguins more typically hunt near the seafloor for creatures that include squid and crustaceans, ScienceAlert noted. But the video serves as evidence that they’ll also go for small fish swimming closer to the surface (like sardines) if the opportunity presents itself.“We wrote in many papers that the seabird community in the Beagle Channel rely on sardines but this is the actual proof, and now it is confirmed and with a star behind the camera: the penguin,” said Raya Rey."}, {"title": "Wildfire Near California's Big Sur Forces Residents To Flee", "text": "BIG SUR, Calif.

Glenn Youngkin (R) announced Wheeler as his pick to serve as secretary of natural resources. The choice outraged state Democrats and environmental groups, who described Wheeler as “the absolute worst pick” for the post.​​AFGE Council 238, a union that represents more than 7,500 EPA employees nationwide, has joined the effort to block Wheeler’s nomination. In a letter to Virginia state senators on Thursday, Marie Owens Powell, the union’s president and a longtime EPA employee, wrote that Wheeler “destroyed or weakened dozens of environmental safeguards at EPA, with the sole intention of bolstering polluting industries’ profit margins.”They warned that Virginia could expect the same of him.“There are few who understand more acutely the threat Mr. Wheeler poses to [the Virginia Department of Natural and Historic Resources] and the natural environment that Virginians cherish than those of us who saw first-hand the impact of Mr. Wheeler’s misguided leadership at the EPA,” the letter reads.Public backlash to Youngkin’s nominee sets the stage for what is likely to be a contentious confirmation process. Democrats maintain a 21-19 majority in Virginia’s state Senate. As The Hill reported, two key moderate Democrats have signaled that they are unlikely to support Wheeler for the job.Wheeler served as the EPA’s deputy administrator before taking over for his scandal-plagued predecessor, Scott Pruitt, in 2019. Wheeler helped spearhead the Trump administration’s industry-friendly agenda, dismantling numerous pollution rules and other clean air and water safeguards to the benefit of the extractive industries that he once represented as a lobbyist. Along the way, he repeatedly downplayed the threat of global climate change and sidelined scientific advisory committees.Owens Powell, who has been with the EPA for nearly three decades and works as an underground storage tank inspector in its Philadelphia office, said the work environment at the federal agency during Wheeler’s tenure was “extremely hostile.”“The simple rejection of scientific principles was just so demoralizing to our staff,” she said.During Wheeler’s tenure, the EPA scrubbed climate change language from the agency’s website. And Wheeler questioned the results of a sobering federal climate assessment, saying some of its findings were “based on the worst-case scenario.”Owens Powell was surprised that Youngkin tapped Wheeler for the job given what she felt was a clear and well-documented record at the EPA. If he’s confirmed, she fears he will not only cause similar damage in Virginia, but negatively impact the EPA’s ability to collaborate with the state agency, ultimately making it more difficult to confront climate change and other environmental threats.“I couldn’t imagine that anyone would have thought he would be a good idea for this position,” she told HuffPost by phone. “It’s ​​AFGE Council 238’s sincere hope that someone in a position of authority will stand up for sound science and the enforcement of corresponding environmental laws and reject this nomination.”Youngkin’s office did not respond to specific questions Thursday, instead referring HuffPost to an interview the governor did with WTVR-TV in Richmond last week in which he called Wheeler “the most qualified person for this job.”A former private equity executive, Youngkin is the first Republican governor of Virginia since 2009. One of his first actions after being sworn in Jan. 15 was to sign an executive order aimed at withdrawing Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a program that several states joined to slash greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.It’s a move that Wheeler, who defended Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris climate agreement, would no doubt approve of, and one Owens Powell suspects Wheeler’s fingerprints are on. Wheeler was a member of Youngkin’s transition team.The EPA union’s letter comes less than a week after more than 150 former EPA staffers urged Virginia state lawmakers to vote down Wheeler’s nomination. In their own letter, the group said the Trump official “sidelined science” at the EPA and “pursued an extremist approach, methodically weakening EPA’s ability to protect public health and the environment, instead favoring polluters.”Sharon Bethune is a Virginia resident, longtime former EPA employee and past vice president for civil rights at AFGE Local 3331. She shares her former colleagues’ concerns. She told HuffPost that during Trump’s term, morale at the EPA was shot, and the “destruction” Wheeler caused factored into her decision to retire in 2019 after nearly four decades at the agency.“It’s mind-boggling how I have to see him again, at my back door this time,” Bethune said. “Right here at my back door.”“I’m thinking about the fact that my grandchildren may not be able to benefit from some of the things I benefit from, all because we put the wrong man in office.”Read the letter below."}, {"title": "Rare, Pristine Rose-Shaped Corals Found In Reef Off Tahiti Coast", "text": "Deep in the South Pacific, scientists have explored a rare stretch of pristine corals shaped like roses off the coast of Tahiti. The reef is thought to be one of the largest found at such depths and seems untouched by climate change or human activities.Laetitia Hédouin said she first saw the corals during a recreational dive with a local diving club months earlier.“When I went there for the first time, I thought, ’Wow — we need to study that reef. There’s something special about that reef,” said Hédouin, a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Moorea, French Polynesia.What struck Hédouin was that the corals looked healthy and weren’t affected by a bleaching event in 2019. Corals are tiny animals that grow and form reefs in oceans around the world.Globally, coral reefs have been depleted from overfishing and pollution. Climate change is also harming delicate corals — including those in areas neighboring the newly discovered reef — with severe bleaching caused by warmer waters. Between 2009 and 2018, 14% of the world’s corals were killed, according to a 2020 report by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Project.The newfound reef, stretching 2 miles (3 kilometers), was studied late last year during a dive expedition supported by UNESCO. Unlike most of the world’s mapped corals, which are found in relatively shallow waters, this one was deeper — between 115 feet (35 meters) to 230 feet (70 meters).Exploring such depths posed a challenge: the deeper a diver goes underwater, the shorter amount of time can be safely spent at each depth. The team was equipped with special tanks and did 200 hours of diving to study the reef, including taking photographs, measurements and samples of the coral.The reef is in a spot where many researchers haven’t spent a lot of time in, said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer Mark Eakin.“We’ll be seeing more of these discoveries as the technology is applied to these locations,” said Eakin. “We may find some bigger ones somewhere, but I think this is always going to be an unusual reef.”The recent volcanic eruption in Tonga that triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific has not affected the reef off Tahiti, said Hédouin.Hédouin hopes the research can help experts understand how the reef has been resilient to climate change and human pressures, and what role these deeper corals might play in the ocean ecosystem. More dives are planned in the coming months.“We know very little about the ocean, and there’s still so much that needs to be recorded, needs to be measured,” said Julian Barbière, the head of UNESCO’s marine policy and regional coordination.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Threats to the Sumatran species include hunting and the destruction of the forests and peat swamps where they spend nearly all their time in trees.Twelve-year-old Menari gave birth to the baby on Christmas Eve; a twin brother was stillborn. Days later, the baby was showing signs of weakness and lack of nursing.Veterinarians examined Menari, a first-time mother, and discovered the lactation problem.Since then the infant has had round-the-clock care from zoo staffers wearing furry vests that the baby can cling to. Until the feeding tube was removed, their duties included making sure he didn’t pick or pull at the thin tube inserted through his nose.He’s been eating well and now weighs 1.98 kilograms (4.35 pounds), Audubon Nature Institute Vice President and general curator Bob Lessnau said in a statement sent by Matherne.Since Jan. 8, six to seven hours a day has been spent in front of the other orangutans so they can get to know him, Lessnau said.“Care staff have noticed that the group is most intrigued when there is a diaper change or a bottle feed happening!” a Jan. 13 update said.Bulan, at age 2 the oldest of father Jambi’s three New Orleans offspring, “is especially interested in the new little guy,” the statement said. Madu, the second, was born in February 2021.Experts from Children’s Hospital of New Orleans have helped out, including a speech pathologist brought in to suggest ways to stimulate the baby’s suckling, Lessnau said.Menari is getting a drug that can help maintain lactation, said Bob MacLean, the zoo’s senior veterinarian.“We don’t know if she will maintain or restart lactation if we have a successful reintroduction of the infant to her,” he said Wednesday.But there’s hope in Menari’s history: She also was hand-raised.“Her mother, Feliz, did start lactating for Menari when she was finally successfully reintroduced to her and started suckling at around 8 months of age,” MacLean said in a statement.A recent video shows Dr. Daniel Cutler, the zoo’s associate veterinarian, gently pulling the baby’s hands from hospital keeper Amy Jones’ fur vest, saying, “He’s ... probably not going to like it — he wants to be nice and close and cuddle.”The baby clung to Cutler’s index fingers as it was raised into the air. Looking around, he pulled himself up until the top of his head was almost even with the fingers he gripped.“He’s starting to say, ‘I don’t like where I’m at ... put me back down.’ Which is exactly what we want him to do,” the veterinarian said."}, {"title": "Menstrual Cup Steamers And Sterilizers To Clean Reusable Period Products", "text": "Sustainability efforts have made their way into many aspects of the modern lifestyle, including that less-than-enjoyable biological function, menstruation. Global Citizen, a collective action organization aimed at reducing world poverty, reported that single-use menstrual products are responsible for more than 200,000 tons of metric waste annually.Conversely, a recent study conducted by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that people who have periods heavily lean toward switching to reusable period products like menstrual cups, discs and period panties rather than using pads and tampons.Jasmine Pedroso, a board-certified OB-GYN at Kindbody fertility clinic in San Francisco, told HuffPost that she thinks the reason for this shift is largely attributed to the fact that there are more brand and sizing options among reusable products than ever before. Additionally, younger generations are more eco-conscious and people are becoming aware of how cost-effective reusable period products are compared to single-use options (one menstrual cup, for example, can last up to six years).This also means that caring for these long-term use products has become part of the conversation. Pedroso said there are potential risks associated with incorrectly disinfecting and storing reusable menstrual products, which are often made of body-safe yet porous silicones.″Washing the cup or disc with harsh chemicals may break down or degrade the material it’s made of, rendering it less effective, and furthermore may irritate and change the acidity of the vagina in ways that may increase your risk of getting a vaginal bacterial or yeast infection,” she said.Instead, many people sanitize their cups or discs by boiling them in a pot of water for about five to 10 minutes. However, this can lead to scorched outcomes when boiling cups are accidentally left unattended for too long.“Steamers and sanitizers made specifically for reusable menstrual cups or discs can make the sanitizing process easier, but they are not 100% necessary,” Pedroso said.Automated steamers and sanitizers are a “set it and forget it” option. They work by holding a small amount of water in the basin, then generating a high temperature steam to disinfect period products without affecting the integrity of silicone. There are also ultraviolet light versions available on the market.“At the completion of each cycle and after sanitization, it is usually recommended that you store [the cup or disc] in a secure, clean, dry place until your next cycle,” Pedroso added. This is another added benefit of automated sanitizers, as many of them double as a clean storage place for cups and discs.If you want a way to effectively care for, disinfect and store your reusable period products, check out the list of sanitizers below.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

With no tourists, many businesses shut down entirely for the season.But visitors have flocked here in recent weeks, braving frigid temperatures for a chance to glimpse Boothbay’s newest resident: a rare bird of prey that has no earthly business in this part of the world.The Steller’s sea eagle, a giant raptor native to parts of Asia and Siberia, has been bouncing around Maine’s midcoast since Dec. 30 — its latest stop on an epic journey across North America. While the species occasionally turns up in western Alaska, this is the first time one has been documented in the Lower 48.“I would say that this is the most exciting rare bird that’s ever been in the United States,” Nick Lund, the advocacy and outreach coordinator for Maine Audubon, told HuffPost.Several factors brought Lund to that conclusion. “Its rarity — there are only 4,000 of them in the entire world,” he said. “Its physical impressiveness. It’s the largest eagle in the world, it’s huge, it’s identifiable. And the fact that it is so far from its home.”The stunning bird, which author Thomas Hynes aptly described as a “muppet,” has a large, cartoonish yellow-orange beak and distinctive white plumage along its upper wings that resembles a splattered snowball. Steller’s sea eagles are significantly larger than bald eagles, with a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, and weigh up to 20 pounds.For whatever reason, the bird seems to have taken a liking to Boothbay, frequenting a number of sites along the water. It is unclear whether it is a male or female.The scene on Sunday felt like a sporting event. That morning, the bird had been spotted near a seasonal inn at Spruce Point, south of town. The sighting was reported on a 1,700-member GroupMe account created to track and discuss the wayward bird. The news traveled fast. By the time HuffPost made it to Spruce Point at 11:30 a.m., the parking lot and road were lined with cars from Maine, Connecticut and New York. But the bird, perhaps startled by the growing crowd, had been flushed from its perch and headed west, toward Mouse Island.Dozens of bird enthusiasts gathered in small groups along the two-lane road, binoculars and spotting scopes aimed across the harbor. Someone thought they’d found it but was disappointed when it was merely a mundane bald eagle.Then one woman, who’d been viewing the bird from a different vantage point, described its location for other anxious birders.“Oh, my God!” another woman shouted after catching a glimpse. “I want to give you a big hug,” she told the woman who’d helped point it out.There, on the north end of the island, the eagle’s white wing bars popped against a backdrop of evergreen branches. Every once in a while, it flashed its brightly colored beak.Louis DeMarco, of Brooklyn, New York, was dropping off a kayak for repair in the town of Bath when a friend and fellow birder told him he wasn’t far from the famous bird. Instead of heading home to New York, DeMarco detoured 45 minutes to Boothbay. The decision didn’t disappoint.“Holy moly! HOLY MOLY!” DeMarco said repeatedly after someone let him use this scope to view the eagle from across the harbor.“These are distant views. I think what they usually say is, ‘Better view desired,’” he said, referencing a saying among birders for when you see a bird but wish you’d been closer. “I didn’t think I had any chance of it, so I’ll take a ‘better view desired.’”This Steller’s sea eagle first surprised the birding world when it turned up along the Denali highway in southeastern Alaska in August 2020. Since then it has continued a slow journey east, popping up in Texas, eastern Canada and now New England. Before arriving in Maine late last month, it spent a week or so mingling with bald eagles along the Taunton River in southeastern Massachusetts.Many have understandably taken to describing the animal as “lost,” but experts say all indications are that it is healthy and content in its travels.“This eagle is right at home,” Lund said. “It’s on a different continent, but it is in a place that is very much like its native range. I choose to sort of celebrate it as an explorer, as someone living its best life and going out on its own and making its way in the world.”Birds turning up outside their normal range, known as avian vagrancy, is not uncommon. Some do get lost or are blown off course in inclement weather, typically during migration. And raptors, particularly younger ones, have been known to venture out in search of new territory.Lund noted that sightings of rare and vagrant birds tend to spark everything from joy and excitement to concern.Laurie Ireland, a lifelong birder and resident of Belfast, Maine, said she found herself in tears thinking about how the eagle might not survive or make it back home. Of all the birds Ireland has observed over the years, the Steller’s ranks high on her list.“I would never get to Russia,” she said. “Never.”A few years ago, a great black hawk, a tropical species native to Central and South America, turned up in Maine and later had to be euthanized after suffering frostbite on its legs. The birding community mourned the loss.Unlike the black hawk, which wasn’t built to survive Maine winters, the Steller’s sea eagle appears to be thriving here, Lund said.As for how long it will stick around Boothbay, it’s anyone’s guess.“Getting into the spring will be very interesting, because that’s when these birds look for mates and territories,” Lund said. He noted it could possibly settle down and even breed with a bald eagle. (An apparent hybrid of the two eagle species was seen on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, in 2004.)“Everyone’s sort of waiting to see what might happen,” Lund said."}, {"title": "Tonga Volcano Relief Complicated By Communications Cutoff, Virus Fears", "text": "Tonga is reeling after a devastating volcanic eruption that caused a tsunami and left the island nation shrouded in ash and without internet service to coordinate urgent clean-up and relief operations.The Tongan government said Tuesday at least three people were confirmed dead after the eruption on Saturday and that some islands were heavily damaged by tsunami waves that neared 50 feet. Every home on one outer island with a few dozen residents was destroyed, and only two houses remained on another, home to about 100 people, officials added.There were few updates on the eruption until now because an undersea cable was severed in the eruption, cutting off the internet and many domestic phone calls, the government said. Officials were only able to reach outlying islands hit hard by the tsunami on Monday using satellite phones.The huge eruption — estimated by NASA to be about 10 megatons — didn’t appear to cause the widespread devastation feared in some heavily populated areas. Officials are primarily worried about heavy levels of ash that have fallen over many islands and the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.Many people remain unaccounted for after the eruption due to the limited communications networks.Tonga has, so far, largely escaped the coronavirus surge that has affected nearly every other nation on the planet: The country has reported just one case and zero deaths from the disease, and all incoming travelers are required to quarantine for 21 days to prevent any new infections.Jonathan Veitch, a United Nations coordinator for the region based in Fiji, said aid workers were urgently working to determine how to deliver needed supplies to Tonga while minimizing any threat from the coronavirus.Australia and New Zealand, some of the country’s nearest neighbors, have loaded up supply planes, but the Tongan airport is unusable due to ash. Aerial images released this week show homes and buildings blanketed in gray drifts.Ships carrying equipment and relief supplies to help clear the runway are en route, but they are still days away, and it’s unclear how they plan to deliver any supplies without making direct contact.Veitch said he was deeply concerned about the availability of water across the nation’s islands, which rely mainly on rain for drinking needs. Volcanic ash has spoiled those water supplies.“The biggest thing that I’m concerned about is water,” Veitch told the BBC this week. “The vast majority of Tongans rely on rainwater for their supply and they can’t use it right now because it’s contaminated. … Any rainwater is acidic.”"}, {"title": "Volcanic Ash Delays Aid Deliveries To Tonga As Scale Of Damage Emerges", "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Thick ash on an airport runway was delaying aid deliveries to the Pacific island nation of Tonga, where significant damage was being reported days after a huge undersea volcanic eruption and tsunami.New Zealand’s military is sending much-needed drinking water and other supplies, but said the ash on the runway will delay the flight at least a day. A towering ash cloud since Saturday’s eruption had prevented earlier flights. New Zealand also sent a navy ship to Tonga Tuesday with another planned to leave later in the day and pledged an initial 1 million New Zealand dollars ($680,000) toward recovery efforts.Australia sent a navy ship from Sydney to Brisbane to prepare for a support mission if needed.Communications with Tonga have been extremely limited, but New Zealand and Australia sent military surveillance flights to assess the damage on Monday, with aerial photos showing the vibrant Tongan landscape transformed by the ash into a gray moonscape.U.N. humanitarian officials and Tonga’s government “report significant infrastructural damage around Tongatapu,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.“There has been no contact from the Ha’apai Group of islands, and we are particularly concerned about two small low-lying islands — Mango and Fonoi — following surveillance flights confirming substantial property damage,” Dujarric said.New Zealand’s High Commission in Tonga also reported “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu, including to resorts and along the waterfront area. The commission said Tonga police had confirmed two deaths from the tsunami, including one who was a British national.Satellite images captured the spectacular eruption, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a giant mushroom above the South Pacific. Tsunami waves of about 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) crashed into Tonga’s shoreline, and crossed the Pacific, causing minor damage from New Zealand to Santa Cruz, California. The eruption set off a sonic boom that could be heard as far away as Alaska.Two people drowned in Peru, which also reported an oil spill after waves moved a ship that was transferring oil at a refinery.Family said British woman Angela Glover, 50, died after being swept away by a wave in Tonga.Nick Eleini said his sister’s body had been found and that her husband survived. “I understand that this terrible accident came about as they tried to rescue their dogs,” Eleini told Sky News. He said it had been his sister’s life dream” to live in the South Pacific and “she loved her life there.”The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano, about 64 kilometers (40 miles) north of Nuku’alofa, was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions. In late 2014 and early 2015, eruptions created a small new island and disrupted air travel to the Pacific archipelago.Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island after a new vent began erupting in late December. Satellite images showed how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga.The U.N. World Food Program is exploring how to bring in relief supplies and more staff and has received a request to restore communication lines in Tonga, Dujarric said.One complicating factor is that Tonga has managed to avoid outbreaks of COVID-19. New Zealand said its military staff were vaccinated and willing to follow Tonga’s protocols.New Zealand’s military said it hoped the airfield in Tonga would be opened either Wednesday or Thursday. The military said it had considered an airdrop but that was “not the preference of the Tongan authorities.”Communications with the island nation is limited because the single underwater fiber-optic cable that connects Tonga to the rest of the world was likely severed in the eruption. The company that owns the cable and repairs could take weeks.Samiuela Fonua, who chairs the board at Tonga Cable Ltd., said the cable appeared to have been severed about 10 to 15 minutes after the eruption. He said the cable lies atop and within coral reef, which can be sharp.Fonua said a ship would need to pull up the cable to assess the damage and then crews would need to fix it. A single break might take a week to repair, he said, while multiple breaks could take up to three weeks. He added that it was unclear yet when it would be safe for a ship to venture near the undersea volcano to undertake the work.A second undersea cable that connects the islands within Tonga also appeared to have been severed, Fonua said. However, a local phone network was working, allowing Tongans to call each other. But he said the lingering ash cloud was continuing to make even satellite phone calls abroad difficult.___Associated Press journalist Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Snow, Ice Blasts Through South With Powerful Winter Storm", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) — A dangerous winter storm combining high winds and ice swept through parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, knocking out power, felling trees and fences and coating roads with a treacherous frigid glaze.Tens of thousands of customers were without power in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. More than an inch of snow fell per hour in some parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, according to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center.The storm was making air travel extremely difficult in some parts of the South. The nation’s hardest-hit airport ― Charlotte Douglas International ― remained open around dawn Sunday, the airport said in a weather briefing. But more than 1,000 Sunday flights in Charlotte have been cancelled – more than 80% of the airport’s Sunday schedule, according to the flight tracking service flightaware.com. Charlotte is a major hub in the South for American Airlines.In Atlanta, where Delta Air Lines operates it main hub, more than 300 Sunday flights have been canceled.Conditions were expected to continue to deteriorate later Sunday, and possible ground stops were possible at airports in the Washington, D.C. area, the Federal Aviation Administration said in its air traffic control plan for Sunday.Parts of North Carolina were under a winter storm warning until Monday morning. Raleigh was experiencing a mix of frozen precipitation.Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said to expect a “significant ice storm across portions of the central Carolinas,” including the Charlotte metropolitan area.In the Asheville area, local television footage showed snow accumulation covering the streets with white. Buncombe County closed all parks, libraries and solid waste facilities through Monday. In Boone to the northeast, Appalachian State University suspended many operations on Sunday and told all but certain essential workers to remain away from campus until at least Monday morning.By early Sunday, more than 100,000 customers were without power in Georgia but the vast majority of them were northeast of the metro Atlanta area, in the northeast Georgia mountains, according to poweroutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide. Rabun County, in Georgia’s northeast corner, was hardest hit with more than half the customers there without power. About 50,000 customers were without power in South Carolina; and 11,000 customers in North Carolina had no power.Crews pretreated roadways in Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia but officials still urged people to stay off them unless travel was necessary. The Tennessee Highway Patrol said in a tweet that some roads in East Tennessee were snow-covered and that troopers were working several accidents due to ice.In Greenville, South Carolina, an out-of-the-ordinary snowfall coated roads before changing to ice. Much of the state was under a winter storm warning, with winds as high as 40 mph (64 kph).The National Weather Service confirmed that a tornado struck southwest Florida, with local media reporting some damage of unknown severity. The Florida Highway Patrol reported that a large tornado crossed Interstate 75 near Naples, causing a semi-truck to overturn. Minor injuries were reported. Florida Power and Light reported that about 16,000 customers in southwest Florida were without power.Lee County firefighters told WINK-TV that 20 homes were destroyed at the Tropicana Mobile Home Resort and one person was injured.After lashing the South, weather forecasters say the Northeast can expect similar conditions.While New York City was expected to be spared from most, if not all, of the snowfall from the winter storm, coastal areas on Long Island and Connecticut were expecting high winds and gale conditions, and upstate New York was projected to get hit with up to a foot of snow to go along with high winds. The National Weather Service forecast winds of up to 60 mph across Long Island and widespread coastal flooding there and in Connecticut by Monday morning. In upstate New York, temperatures in the single digits were projected to rise into the 20s and bring heavy snow beginning Sunday night and lasting until Monday night.Six to 12 inches of snow was expected in parts of east-central Ohio and western Pennsylvania from Sunday afternoon, resulting in slick and hazardous road conditions. In parts of eastern Pennsylvania, forecasters expected three to five inches of snow early changing to a wintry mix including sleet and freezing rain or completely rain."}, {"title": "A Massive Icefish Breeding Colony Existed In Secret In Antarctica — Until Now", "text": "A polar research exploration has discovered a previously unknown breeding colony of millions of fish in an icy Antarctic sea.Believed to be the world’s largest known fish breeding ground, the expanse of about 60 million Jonah’s icefish nests stretches across 92 square miles of the Weddell Sea floor, according to The New York Times.Icefish have no red blood cells ― which gives them transparent blood ― and skulls that you can see through. Their clear blood also contains a special protein that stops it from freezing.The scientists who made the discovery, researchers from Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute aboard the RV Polarstern, weren’t looking for icefish nests in particular. But when they came across the nest site, they knew they’d found something special.“I’d never seen anything like it in 15 years of being an ocean scientist,” researcher Dr. Autun Purser told CNN. “After that dive, we emailed the experts on shore who know about fish like this. They said, yep, this is pretty unique.”A typical nest had around 1,500 to 2,000 eggs, New Scientist reports. Purser told the publication that it’s unclear how many of those eggs ultimately hatch and survive, and that in general, a lot about icefish is still unknown.Most of the nests were guarded by an adult fish, but in some cases, one fish guarded multiple nests. Still other nests were empty, or contained the carcass of a fish who died at its post. Fish who died in the middle of the nest field tended to just rot in place, while those who died closer to the edges were scavenged by animals like starfish and octopuses.Another animal that enjoys dining on the icefish is the Weddell seal, a plump, carnivorous mammal that can dive up to 2,000 feet into the ocean.The researchers who discovered the icefish nests took a look at satellite tracking data on the seals and found that the nest site is a major destination for Weddell seal dives.“They’re having a nice dinner,” Purser told the Times."}, {"title": "Undersea Volcano Erupts In Pacific, Islanders Rush To Escape Tsunami", "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — An undersea volcano erupted in spectacular fashion Saturday near the Pacific nation of Tonga, sending tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground. Tsunami advisories were issued for Hawaii, Alaska and the U.S. Pacific coast.There were no immediate reports of injuries or on the extent of the damage because all internet connectivity with Tonga was lost at about 6:40 p.m. local time, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for the network intelligence firm Kentik.Tonga gets its internet via an undersea cable from Suva, Fiji, which presumably was damaged. Southern Cross Cable Network, the company that manages the connection, does not know yet “if the cable is cut or just suffering power loss,” chief technical officer Dean Veverka said. He said he assumed the eruption was responsible.The Fiji-based Islands Business news site reported that a convoy of police and military troops evacuated King Tupou VI from his palace near the shore. He was among the many residents who headed for higher ground.In Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported waves that measured half a meter (1.6 feet) in Nawiliwili, Kauai and 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) in Hanalei. The National Weather Service said there were reports of boats getting pushed up in docks, but the hazard diminished as the morning went on.“We are relieved that there is no reported damage and only minor flooding throughout the islands,” the tsunami center said, describing the situation in Hawaii. The tsunami advisory for the islands was lifted about 11 hours after the eruption more than 4,828 kilometers (3,000 miles) away.On Tonga, home to about 105,000 people, video posted to social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas, swirling around homes, a church and other buildings. Satellite images showed a huge eruption, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters.New Zealand’s military said it was monitoring the situation and remained on standby, ready to assist if asked.The Tonga Meteorological Services said a tsunami warning was declared for all of the archipelago, and data from the Pacific tsunami center said waves of 80 centimeters (2.7 feet) were detected.A Twitter user identified as Dr. Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau posted video showing waves crashing ashore.“Can literally hear the volcano eruption, sounds pretty violent,” he wrote, adding in a later post: “Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.”The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions.Earth imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent there began erupting in late December.Satellite images captured by the company show how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga.“The surface area of the island appears to have expanded by nearly 45% due to ashfall,” Planet Labs said days before the latest activity.Following Saturday’s eruption, residents in Hawaii, Alaska and along the U.S. Pacific coast were advised to move away from the coastline to higher ground and to pay attention to specific instructions from their local emergency management officials, said Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska.“We don’t issue an advisory for this length of coastline as we’ve done - I’m not sure when the last time was - but it really isn’t an everyday experience,” Snider said.He said the waves slamming ashore in Hawaii were just under the criteria for a more serious tsunami warning.“It looks like everything will stay below the warning level, but it’s difficult to predict because this is a volcanic eruption, and we’re set up to measure earthquake or seismic-driven sea waves,” Snider said.The first waves to hit the continental United States measured about 33 centimeters 1 foot in Nikolski, Alaska and 59 centimeters (1.9 feet) in Adak, Alaska. A wave of about 79 centimeters (2.6 feet) was observed in Monterey, California, according to the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center.Beaches and piers were closed across Southern California as a precaution. The National Weather Service tweeted there were “no significant concerns about inundation.” Strong rip currents were possible, however, and officials warned people to stay out of the water.On California’s central coast, the National Weather Service reported tsunami waves up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) and flooding in beach parking lots at Port San Luis. About 200 miles (320 km) down the coast, the waves were much smaller at Southern California’s Seal Beach, according to Michael Pless, the owner of M&M Surf School.“The waves are looking pretty flat,” Pless said. “We’re hoping they reopen the beach in a couple hours.”Crowds gathered at the Santa Cruz Harbor in California to watch the rising and falling water strain boat ties on docks. Law enforcement tried to clear people away when big surges started at around 7:30 a.m.About an hour later, a surge went over the back lip of the harbor, filling a parking lot and low-lying streets and setting some cars afloat. In 2011 after the Japanese earthquake a series of surges cost $20 million of damage in the harbor.Although experienced surfers would consider the waves reaching the West Coast barely high enough to qualify as swells, the National Weather Service warned that tsunamis cause deceptive water surges powerful enough to pull people out to sea.Residents of American Samoa were alerted of a tsunami warning by local broadcasters as well as church bells that rang territory-wide Saturday. An outdoor siren warning system was out of service. Those living along the shoreline quickly moved to higher ground.As night fell, there were no reports of any damage and the Hawaii-based tsunami center canceled the alert.Authorities in the nearby island nations of Fiji and Samoa also issued warnings, telling people to avoid the shoreline due to strong currents and dangerous waves. In New Zealand, officials warned of possible storm surges from the eruption.New Zealand’s private forecaster, Weather Watch, tweeted that people as far away as Southland, the country’s southernmost region, reported hearing sonic booms from the eruption. Others reported that many boats were damaged by a tsunami that hit a marina in Whangarei, in the Northland region.Earlier, the Matangi Tonga news site reported that scientists observed massive explosions, thunder and lightning near the volcano after it started erupting early Friday. Satellite images showed a 5-kilometer (3- mile) -wide plume rising into the air to about 20 kilometers (12 miles).The Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano is located about 64 kilometers (40 miles) north of the capital, Nuku’alofa. In late 2014 and early 2015, a series of eruptions in the area created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days.There is not a significant difference between volcanoes underwater and on land, and underwater volcanoes become bigger as they erupt, at some point usually breaching the surface, said Hans Schwaiger, a research geophysicist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory.With underwater volcanoes, however, the water can add to the explosivity of the eruption as it hits the lava, Schwaiger added.Before an explosion, there is generally an increase in small local earthquakes at the volcano, but depending on how far it is from land, that may not be felt by residents along the shoreline, Schwaiger said.In 2019, Tonga lost internet access for nearly two weeks when a fiber-optic cable was severed. The director of the local cable company said at the time that a large ship may have cut the cable by dragging an anchor. Until limited satellite access was restored people couldn’t even make international calls.Southern Cross Cable Network’s Veverka said limited satellite connections exist between Tonga and other parts of the world but he did not know if they might be affected by power outages.Associated Press writers Jennifer McDermott in Providence, Rhode Island, Martha Mendoza in Santa Cruz, California, Frank Bajak in Boston, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Fili Sagapolutele in Pago Pago, American Samoa, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report."}, {"title": "#BettyWhiteChallenge Raising Money And Awareness For Animals", "text": "The late Betty White was a tireless lifetime advocate for animals, from caring for those without homes to launching her own weekly TV show, “The Pet Set,” dedicated to her celebrity friends and their pets.Her most far-reaching contribution, though, may be yet to come: On Monday, fans of White will be poised to donate to animal welfare charities and shelters as part of what’s been dubbed the #BettyWhiteChallenge. And animal welfare nonprofits are gearing up to capitalize on the viral tribute to the star of “The Golden Girls” and “Hot in Cleveland” on what would have been her 100th birthday.“I’ve had many conversations with Betty about animal welfare, and I know she’s looking down from heaven and really smiling,” said Robin Ganzert, who leads American Humane, an animal welfare organization that White was involved with for more than 60 years.“She’ll be smiling on her birthday,” she said. “And she’ll be smiling about the lives she’s changed.”It isn’t exactly clear who started the #BettyWhiteChallenge on social media shortly after White’s death on Dec. 31. However it began, the idea — to donate $5 to a local animal rescue organization in White’s name on her birthday — quickly took off and drew support from celebrities like actors Mark Hamill and George Takei on Twitter.Traffic to American Humane’s website spiked after White’s passing. Ganzert said donations, too, have increased. The nonprofit is waiting to reveal by how much until more gifts flood in, including sizable donations it’s expecting from some donors.During the decades in which White was involved with the organization, she made fundraising appeals and served on its board and as a presenter and judge on its televised show featuring “hero” dogs. During tapings of “The Pet Set” in the early 1970s, Ganzert said, White would have American Humane representatives on set to ensure that animals were safe. In 2012, the nonprofit honored her with its highest award, the National Humanitarian Medal.Ganzert would also give White a photo book each year of the animals the organization helped.“She kept those out on her coffee table,” Ganzert said. “And (it) always touched me whenever we would visit.”Best Friends Animal Society, a Utah-based animal welfare organization, has raised $25,000 in donations made in White’s name, according to the group’s chief mission officer Holly Sizemore. The group has promoted the #BettyWhiteChallenge broadly across its social media channels to drum up support both for its work and other organizations.“That’s the beauty of animal welfare,” Sizemore said. “There’s something for everyone to support.

(AP) — The Biden administration said Wednesday it will hold its first offshore wind auction next month, offering nearly 500,000 acres off the coast of New York and New Jersey for wind energy projects that could produce enough electricity to power nearly 2 million homes.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said the Feb. 23 auction in the New York Bight region will allow offshore wind developers to bid on six lease areas, the most ever offered in an auction for offshore wind and wind energy projects.“The Biden-Harris administration has made tackling the climate crisis a centerpiece of our agenda, and offshore wind opportunities like the New York Bight present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fight climate change and create good-paying, union jobs in the United States,” Haaland said.The auction comes after the administration announced a flurry of clean energy actions Wednesday, such as steps to speed up reviews of clean energy projects on public lands, including solar, onshore wind and geothermal energy. The Interior Department has approved 18 onshore projects during Biden’s first year in office. The projects are set to deliver more than 4 gigawatts of clean energy.The administration also said it is accelerating the deployment of new transmission lines, as enabled by the new bipartisan infrastructure law, to make the grid more reliable and resilient in the face of intensifying extreme weather. Last year was the deadliest weather year for the contiguous United States since 2011, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A total of 688 people died in 20 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters that cost a combined $145 billion, the agency said.President Joe Biden has set a goal to install 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030, generating enough electricity to power more than 10 million homes. The administration has approved the nation’s first two commercial-scale offshore wind projects in federal waters: the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind project off the Massachusetts coast and the 130-megawatt South Fork wind farm near New York’s Long Island.Haaland has said the Interior Department hopes to conduct as many as seven offshore wind lease sales by 2025, including the New York Bight and sales offshore in the Carolinas and California later this year.Democratic Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York and Phil Murphy of New Jersey hailed the New York Bight lease sale, saying it would help their states chart an ambitious path toward a clean energy economy. The projects there could produce up to 7 gigawatts of electricity.“Today’s milestone further highlights New York’s commitment to reaching its offshore wind goals,″ Hochul said in a statement.“Offshore wind holds the tremendous promise for our future in terms of climate change, economic growth and job creation,” Murphy added. “New Jersey is already committed to creating nearly one-quarter of the nation’s offshore wind-generation market and these transformative projects are proof that climate action can drive investments in infrastructure and manufacturing while creating good-paying, union jobs.″The decision to move forward with the lease comes after commercial fisheries and other stakeholders weighed in, resulting in a reduction of the size of the lease area by 72%, according to the Interior Department.The closest distance to New Jersey among the parcels is 27 nautical miles offshore, while the nearest to New York is 20 nautical miles away, the department said.The project carries several stipulations, including the requirement of project labor agreements and planned incentives for using components like blades, turbines and foundations made in the United States.——Daly reported from Washington."}, {"title": "EPA Moves To Crack Down On Dangerous Coal Ash Storage Ponds", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency is taking its first major action to address toxic wastewater from coal-burning power plants, ordering utilities to stop dumping waste into unlined storage ponds and speed up plans to close leaking or otherwise dangerous coal ash sites.Plants in four states will have to close the coal ash ponds months or years ahead of schedule, the EPA said Tuesday, citing deficiencies with groundwater monitoring, cleanup or other problems.Coal ash, the substance that remains when coal is burned to generate electricity, contains a toxic mix of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and other heavy metals. It can pollute waterways, poison wildlife and cause respiratory illness among those living near massive ponds where the waste is stored.The actions mark the first time the EPA has enforced a 2015 rule aimed at reducing groundwater pollution from coal-fired power plants that has contaminated streams, lakes and underground aquifers.U.S. coal plants produce about 100 million tons (90 million metric tons) annually of ash and other waste.The Obama administration regulated the storage and disposal of toxic coal ash for the first time, including a requirement to close coal-ash dumping ponds that were unstable or contaminated groundwater. The Trump administration weakened the Obama-era rule in 2020, allowing utilities to use cheaper technologies and take longer to comply with pollution reduction guidelines that are less stringent than what the agency originally adopted.EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the actions announced Tuesday will ensure that coal ash ponds meet strong environmental and safety standards and that operators of industrial facilities are held accountable.“I’ve seen firsthand how coal ash contamination can hurt people and communities,″ said Regan, a former North Carolina environmental regulator who negotiated with Duke Energy what state officials say was the largest cleanup agreement for toxic coal ash.“For too long, communities already disproportionately impacted by high levels of pollution have been burdened by improper coal ash disposal,″ Regan said. “Today’s actions will help us protect communities and hold facilities accountable. We look forward to working with our state partners to reverse damage that has already occurred.″In separate letters sent Tuesday, EPA denied requests for extensions of coal ash permits by the Clifty Creek power plant in Madison, Indiana; James M. Gavin plant in Cheshire, Ohio; and the Ottumwa plant in Ottumwa, Iowa.The Greenidge Generation plant in Dresden, New York, was ruled ineligible for an extension. The former coal plant now uses natural gas.The H.L. Spurlock plant in Maysville, Kentucky, will be required to fix groundwater monitoring as a condition for continued operation of its coal ash pond, the EPA said.Lisa Evans, a senior attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, said the enforcement action “sends a strong message to industry that (compliance with the EPA rule) is not a paperwork exercise. It requires them to clean up these toxic sites.″Frank Holleman, a lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center who has battled Duke Energy and utilities over coal ash disposal, said the enforcement action offers significant protections for clean water nationwide.“The EPA has sent a clear message that (power plant operators) cannot leave coal ash sitting in primitive, polluting ponds across the country,″ he said.Utilities in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and other states that are still storing coal ash in leaking, unlined pits sitting in groundwater and next to waterways are among those affected by the decision, Holleman said.Coal ash disposal ponds date back decades. Data released by utilities in 2018 showed widespread evidence of contamination at coal plants from Virginia to Alaska.Coal ash storage and disposal went largely unregulated until a 2008 spill at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant in Kingston, Tennessee. A containment dike burst and flooding covered more than 300 acres (121 million hectares), dumped waste into two nearby rivers, destroyed homes and brought national attention to the issue.In 2014, an estimated 39,000 tons of coal ash spewed into the Dan River after a drainage pipe running below a waste dump collapsed at a Duke Energy plant in Eden, North Carolina. The toxic sludge turned the river gray for more than 70 miles (112 kilometers).The EPA on Tuesday reiterated its “consistently held position that surface impoundments or landfills cannot be closed with coal ash in contact with groundwater.″ Limiting contact between coal ash and groundwater after closure is critical to minimizing contaminants released into the environment and will help ensure communities near the sites have access to safe water for drinking and recreation, the EPA said."}, {"title": "Hyena Pulls Ultimate Scavenger Move On Python And Its Baby Impala Prey", "text": "A hungry hyena in Botswana was in no mood to abide by the finders-keepers rule of the wild as a python constricted a young impala.

About every 3 to 5 years, a spike in the population of lemmings, their chief food source, results in a larger number of surviving owl chicks. In those “irruption” years, more birds migrate and head farther south.“A lot of the snowy owls we’re seeing now in the East and Upper Midwest are young birds, on their first migration,” he said. “In these irruption years, they tend to go farther south than they usually would.”On eBird, a nonprofit platform used by birdwatchers, snowy owls have been reported this winter in Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, North Carolina and Maryland.Since it was first seen, the Capitol Hill owl has attracted a few dozen birdwatchers each night hoping to spot the same owl species that delivers messages to Harry Potter.The onlookers have included new birdwatchers and those who have been doing it for decades, like Swiss ambassador to the U.S., Jacques Pitteloud, many hoping for a “lifer” — the first time a birdwatcher has seen a particular bird.Last Thursday, the owl perched on a bronze eagle atop a flagpole. Then it soared, its 5-foot white wingspan silhouetted against the inky night sky, to land on a large stone orb held by carved birds, part of an ornate fountain.Ambassador Pitteloud picked up his camera tripod and ran through the grass to get a better view. When he later posted on Facebook, the 50-year veteran birdwatcher wrote, “The Superstar of Union Station! Snowy owl, a lifer for me in a very, very unlikely setting!”Kerry Snyder, who lives in Washington, said she recently became an avid birdwatcher. “I got into birding during the pandemic – it’s a great way to connect with people outdoors, when that’s been the safest place to be.”She reminded other onlookers not to use flash photography, or approach the owl too closely, lest the bird feel startled or threatened — good practices for viewers observing any bird of prey.Scientists consider snowy owls to be “ vulnerable ” to extinction and estimate the total global population to be less than 30,000 birds.Weidensaul said that threats to snowy owls include urban hazards — in particular, vehicle collisions and poisons used to kill prey animals like rats, which can also kill raptors — as well as climate change.“The climate is changing more dramatically in the Arctic than anywhere else on Earth,” he said, and that may make sightings like this one even rarer. In some parts of the Arctic, thinning ice is already reducing the number of boom years for lemmings.After decades studying snowy owls, Weidensaul still feels awe: “This is a piece of the Arctic in downtown DC — you’re not going to see a polar bear walking in front of the White House.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

It took rescue boats several trips back and forth to collect everyone.No one was injured and no one required medical attention, though the sheriff’s office called the situation “extremely dangerous.”“Although the chunk of ice remained fairly stable, its condition was deteriorating rapidly (and) cracking up as it moved with the open water pounding at the edge of it,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.The sheriff’s office initially reported that 27 people had been rescued, but later raised that number to 34.Although ice is typically solid along the shore in January, a passing barge “may have disrupted” it, said Lt. John Bain.Shane Nelson and his friend Robert Verhagen told WLUK Fox 11 that they were ice fishing for the first time ever and heard what sounded like a large gunshot when the ice cracked.“We thought it was interesting, got out of our shanty, took a look and people were yelling on the ice we’re separating,” said Nelson.“Didn’t catch any fish, ran out of propane early and got stranded on the ice,” he added."}, {"title": "Snow Leopard Dies After Contracting COVID-19, Illinois Zoo Says", "text": "An 11-year-old snow leopard, who was one of five big cats to test positive for COVID-19 at an Illinois zoo last month, has died from complications from the virus, the zoo said.Rilu, whose photo was once projected on New York City’s iconic Empire State Building to highlight the need to protect endangered animals, died after “struggling with COVID-induced pneumonia,” the Miller Park Zoo in Bloomington announced Thursday.The spotted mountain cat, which has an estimated population of a few thousand according to the extinction-tracking group International Union for Conservation of Nature, had tested positive for the virus on Dec. 3. This test result came two weeks after the cat, along with three other snow leopards and a Sumatran tiger, first showed symptoms of the virus, the zoo had said.The four other cats that tested positive for the virus continue to show mostly minor symptoms, a zoo representative told HuffPost Sunday.“Rilu’s personality and beauty will be missed by guests and staff, but he will not be forgotten,” the zoo said in an Instagram post.In captivity, snow leopards have been known to live as long as 22 years, according to the animal conservation group Snow Leopard Trust.Wildlife photographer Joel Sartore, whose larger-than-life photo of Rilu was showcased on the 102-story New York building in 2015, shared a video of the big cat on his Instagram page on Friday, while urging people to get vaccinated against the virus.“Snow leopards are proving extremely susceptible to the disease, and it’s often fatal. If you haven’t received a vaccination and booster yet, please do so. It’s more than just human lives that are at stake,” he wrote.As Sartore noted, Rilu, who produced seven living offspring while with the zoo, is not the first known snow leopard to die after contracting the virus.Three other snow leopards died from complications from COVID-19 at a zoo in Nebraska in November. Their deaths also came about a month after testing positive for the virus. Two Sumatran tigers also tested positive for the virus at that zoo but were said to have made a full recovery.It’s possible for humans to infect cats with the coronavirus and for cats to spread it to other felines, though it’s less likely that they can spread the virus to humans, according to the Cornell Feline Health Center.The center and federal health officials recommend that feline caretakers diagnosed with COVID-19 quarantine themselves and leave the care of their cats to someone else or avoid contact with the cats as much as possible.Miller Park Zoo’s animal building, where the snow leopards were being held, had been closed for two weeks prior to the cats testing positive for the virus and “any issue has been isolated,” the zoo said last month.The building was closed again last week due to a rise in COVID-19 cases throughout Central Illinois, a park official told local station WMBD.The zoo requires all guests to wear masks, for the safety of the animals, when entering a building that houses an animal habitat, according to the zoo’s website."}, {"title": "Animals Are Being Named After Betty White In Honor Of Her Charity Work", "text": "The late Betty White is getting one honor she surely would have appreciated ― a bunch of animal namesakes.The “Golden Girls” icon was outspoken about her love of animals, and regularly donated to and volunteered for animal-related organizations. While some of this work was public at the time, other acts of charity largely flew under the radar during White’s life and are only becoming more widely known about now, like the time she paid to fly animals from a storm-stricken aquarium to safety after Hurricane Katrina.After White’s death on New Year’s Eve at the age of 99, stories have been bubbling up about animal shelters and other organizations honoring the actor by naming some of their four-legged residents after her.In some cases, these are nonprofits that White benefited directly. The Texas-based Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue received tens of thousands of dollars over the years in checks signed by “Betty White-Ludden.” (White’s late husband was game show host Allen Ludden.)“A lot of people said it could be any Betty White, but the checks came from her house under her name and then started coming from her management company,” Peaceful Valley Executive Director Mark Meyers told the San Angelo Standard-Times. “It was the real deal Betty White.”So when the rescue group was struggling to come up with a name for a fuzzy foal who had been born on Christmas, they made a decision after learning about the actor’s death. The foal’s full name is now Betty White-Ludden, though most just call her Betty. The rescue also dedicated its recently renovated nursery to White.And Guide Dogs for the Blind, which trains guide dogs and provides them at no cost to people who are blind or have low vision, named one of its new puppies BettyRose, a reference to her “Golden Girls” character Rose Nylund, CEO Christine Benninger told TMZ.White appeared in public service announcements for the nonprofit and also donated annual “generous gifts,” Benninger told Today. She even adopted a golden retriever, Pontiac, who turned out not to be cut out for guide dog work.Even organizations without a direct connection to White are still getting in on the naming trend. Staff at All4Paws Animal Rescue in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, felt that Betty was a perfect name for a sweet puppy who was hit by a car and found around the same time that White died.“Betty our little puppy, our little broken puppy girl, she is an absolute sweetheart,” All4Paws spokesperson Amelia Cummings told WPDE. “So just the correlation between the two, the timing, it was just perfect. Like absolutely, this has to be Betty.”And Texas’ Houston Humane Society bestowed her name on a little white dog found wandering the streets in the cold.“We named her after the legendary and the beautiful, resilient Betty White,” spokesperson Olivia Valdez told KHOU.The animal shelter was also using this canine Betty White to help spread the word about a campaign that sprung up on social media in the days following the actor’s death, the “Betty White Challenge.” The “challenge” encourages fans to donate $5 to an animal rescue or shelter on Jan. 17, which would have been White’s 100th birthday.Another spokes-animal for the challenge had been named after the actor ― or at least, her most iconic role ― while White was still alive. A cat named Rose Nylund has been available for adoption at Hawaii’s Maui Humane Society for more than 100 days, Hawaii News Now reported.

He also helped mentor two other dogs at the zoo who took on similar duties.Pairing cheetah cubs with puppies is a relatively common practice for zoos, especially in cases when cubs have come separated from their siblings or were born without them. The puppies and cubs mutually benefit from socialization and exercise, and the timid cubs end up taking a cue from the dogs and become less fearful of their surroundings.“We want them to have confidence,” the Columbus Zoo’s Suzi App told The Wall Street Journal in 2019. “When we raise them with dogs, they have all the confidence.”Though the animals may become less close as they get older, they typically remain friendly companions.Coby’s duties extended beyond cheetahs.

One says to the other, “OK, you man the guns and I’ll drive.”That classic dad joke may not be so absurd to scientists who recently trained six goldfish to drive what they call a “fish operated vehicle,” or FOV.The aim of the study, conducted by researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, was to find out whether a goldfish’s navigational ability is universal, or whether it’s restricted to the fish’s home environment. In other words, they wanted to see whether a goldfish’s underwater navigational skills work, say, on land.Since goldfish need to be underwater to breathe, the scientists had to use a creative method to test their land skills. That’s where the FOV came in. A small goldfish tank was placed on a set of wheels, and the vehicle used a camera and remote sensing system that moved the whole apparatus in whatever direction the goldfish swam.This video shows the process in action:To test the animals’ ability to find their way around on land, the researchers successfully trained the fish to move the FOV toward various targets for a food reward. They then amped up the difficulty by making the task harder ― for instance, by changing the starting point of the FOV.The goldfish “indeed were able to operate the vehicle, explore the new environment, and reach the target regardless of the starting point, all while avoiding dead-ends and correcting location inaccuracies,” the researchers wrote.That means the fish were pretty good drivers. And it suggests goldfish may be smarter than many people give them credit for.“The study hints that navigational ability is universal rather than specific to the environment,” Ph.D. student and lead researcher Shachar Givon said in a press release issued by the university. “Second, it shows that goldfish have the cognitive ability to learn a complex task in an environment completely unlike the one they evolved in. As anyone who has tried to learn how to ride a bike or to drive a car knows, it is challenging at first.”"}, {"title": "Trump EPA Chief Andrew Wheeler Tapped For Virginia's Top Environmental Post", "text": "Incoming Virginia Gov.

Shortly after being confirmed as head of the EPA in 2019, for example, Wheeler falsely claimed that “most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.”Wheeler has served on Youngkin’s transition team since November. News of his appointment to the secretary post, which Politico first reported Wednesday, drew swift backlash from state Democrats and environmental groups.“As head of EPA under former President Trump, Wheeler did nothing more than cater to corporate polluter interests time and time again, putting their welfare ahead of our environment and Americans’ health,” Michael Town, executive director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. “This is hands down the most extreme nomination for an environmental post in Virginia’s history and the absolute worst pick that the Governor-elect could make.”U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) slammed Wheeler as “an anti-environment ideologue” and “one of the worst people the Governor-elect could have chosen for this job.”“He led the Trump Administration’s efforts to dismantle environmental protections, selling out the American people and the EPA’s very mission to benefit corporate polluters,” Beyer said in a statement.Beyer noted Wheeler’s silence in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. As HuffPost previously reported, Wheeler wrote in an email to agency staffers the day after Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol that he was “completely disgusted” by the event, but planned to stay on at the EPA until President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. He did not publicly condemn the attack.Unlike other Trump officials who resigned following the insurrection, Wheeler “stood by Trump and refused to criticize him,” Beyer said.It remains to be seen if Wheeler’s nomination can survive the confirmation process.

She did not ask for fanfare; she just wanted to help.”The aquarium didn’t know about White’s contribution until after the fact. Spokesperson Annie Matherne confirmed to HuffPost that White paid for “a portion” of the rescue mission, but the organization does not know the exact amount because Audubon didn’t handle the transaction directly.Audubon Aquarium is built on high ground, with strong concrete walls and windows designed to withstand high winds. Aquarium staff had taken measures to prepare for the approach of Katrina.But in the aftermath of the storm, the aquarium’s generators faltered and filters in the marine tanks stopped working, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time. Most of the facility’s 10,000 fish died.“It was unknown before the storm of just how extensive the damage would be to New Orleans, as is the case with many hurricanes,” Matherne said. “Our hurricane plan does not include evacuating animals ahead of a storm because storms can shift and we do not want to unnecessarily stress the animals in our care. There are also a number of logistics ... that make an evacuation difficult.”Katrina turned out to be a historic storm that left nearly 2,000 people dead, millions homeless and caused $125 billion in damages. The entire city of New Orleans lost power for weeks, which made evacuating the aquarium’s surviving animals necessary. Those survivors included, among others, all of the aquarium’s 19 penguins and two sea otters named Buck and Emma.Tom Dyer, who local news station WWL identified as a caretaker for the aquarium’s birds when Katrina hit, recalled in a Twitter thread that Monterey Bay Aquarium in California agreed to take the penguins and otters. Those animals flew on a private plane out of Baton Rouge, Dyer said.At the time, he knew only that an anonymous donor paid for the flight. It “leaked” years later that the benefactor had been White, Dyer said.The animals later returned to the Audubon Aquarium, Matherne said.

The cleaning service had been hired by the zoo to clean areas like bathrooms and the gift shop, not animal enclosures, according to the sheriff’s office.At some point after the zoo had closed for the day, the man climbed a 4.5-foot fence that separated the tiger, named Eko, from the public, the Naples Daily News reported. He then put his hand through a second fence, at which point the 8-year-old tiger bit his hand and pulled the man’s arm toward him into the enclosure.Someone called deputies to the zoo around 6:30 pm. The sheriff’s office ― which has released graphic body camera footage of the incident ― said a deputy initially kicked at the fence and attempted to get Eko to release the man’s arm.

In February 2020, the zoo published a blog post welcoming Eko to the zoo and discussing the plight of critically endangered Malayan tigers, of which there are an estimated fewer than 200 adults in the wild.“Eko is a great ambassador for his species,” the zoo wrote. “When guests see him, we hope they fall in love and want to learn how they can do their part to save his cousins in the wild.”The zoo frequently posted photos and videos of the charismatic tiger on Facebook, including wishing him a happy eighth birthday in November and, just Tuesday, sharing a “Tongue Out Tuesday” photo of the big cat licking his nose."}, {"title": "This Year's Record-Breaking Climate Disasters Usher In A Horrific New Normal", "text": "This year’s devastating climate disasters, while breaking records, are only a glimpse at the worsening heat, fires, storms and floods expected in years to come.Over the past year, we’ve seen the hottest July ever recorded on the planet (again), the largest ever single wildfire in California history (again), and deadly hurricanes and flooding along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coasts (again).This year’s United Nations climate report repeated what similar reports have been saying for years, with even greater certainty: Humans are the “unequivocal” cause of climate change, and the window to avoid catastrophic living conditions worldwide due to global warming is rapidly closing.“We’re looking at a long-term, undeniable trend,” said Astrid Caldas, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She noted that the last seven years have been the hottest on record, adding, “Imagine what we’re in for if warming continues unabated.”“Climate change is here now, and we need to act now to keep it in check.”Climate experts have repeated calls to governments and corporations to reduce fossil fuel emissions to stave off the worst of the climate crisis’s effects.The communities most vulnerable to climate change — including those going through slower recoveries after disasters — are disproportionately poor, Black and Latinx.Here are some of this year’s historic climate disasters — which we can expect more of in the future.In July, Earth’s hottest month ever recorded, temperatures soared above 100 degrees in California and the Pacific Northwest, causing hundreds to die from heat-related causes, with some of the victims being undocumented farmworkers.“2021 once again highlights the narrative that it is no longer a ‘new normal’ but normal,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric sciences program. “The bigger concern now is the next phase — continued acceleration of the pace of such extremes.”A report by the Adrienne-Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center forecast that extreme heat could kill tens of thousands of Americans each year in the coming decades unless significant action is taken to combat the climate crisis. Nearly all U.S. counties will be affected by extreme heat in the coming years, disproportionately harming Black and Latinx people.In California — which is under a drought emergency after recording its driest year in nearly a century — wildfires have continued to worsen. This July, the Dixie fire in Northern California grew to the largest single fire in state history. Eight of the 10 largest fires in California history took place in just the last five years.Only two fires in California history have ever crossed the Sierra Nevada — and both took place this year, just a month apart.“There is fire activity in California that we have never seen before,” Thom Porter, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said in August as the Caldor fire near Lake Tahoe showed an “unprecedented” spread of more than 20,000 acres in one day. “Every acre can and will burn in this state,” the Cal Fire chief warned.This year was the third most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was the first time that two hurricane seasons in a row had so many storms that the agency ran beyond its list of 21 storm names.Hurricane Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast in September as a Category 4 storm, making it one of the strongest ever to make landfall in the state. It caused more than two dozen deaths in the state before moving to the Northeast, where its heavy rainfalls brought the first-ever flash flood emergency to New York City and caused at least 50 deaths in the area.The previous month, floods in Tennessee killed at least 21 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. The following month, floods in Alabama killed at least four people, including a child.In mid-December, Typhoon Rai slammed into the Philippines, leaving over 375 people dead and forcing hundreds of thousands to evacuate.Conservation psychologist Susan Clayton said that “thanks to climate change, we can expect to see more of these ‘unusual’ climate events in the future,” adding that there will also be “increasing disparities, such that disadvantaged communities, who often live in areas that are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, are more severely impacted.”Jeff Masters, a meteorologist writing for Yale Climate Connections, echoed that “the extreme weather events of 2021 were a reminder that the climate of the 20th Century — which society’s infrastructure was designed for — no longer exists.”The scientist urged governments to prepare for “more intense downpours, higher storm surges, and more intense droughts, heat waves, and fires,” adding that “above all, we must support the transition to a clean-energy economy and stop burning fossil fuels.”"}, {"title": "Thomas Lovejoy, Biologist Who Studied Biodiversity And Extinction, Dies At 80", "text": "FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — Thomas E. Lovejoy, a leading conservation biologist who is credited with popularizing the term “biological diversity,” has died. He was 80.His death on Saturday was announced by George Mason University, where he was director of the Institute for a Sustainable Earth, and the Amazon Biodiversity Center, which he founded.Lovejoy began referring to biological diversity — the rich variety of life on Earth — in the late 1970s. Later shortened to biodiversity, it has become one of the most important themes of the age of climate change.A leading extinction researcher, Lovejoy found that habitat destruction, pollution and global warming were snuffing out species around the world. He called for restoring forests to encourage the regrowth of native plants and animals and for protecting large tracts of water and land.Lovejoy also was involved in the founding of U.S. public television’s “Nature,” the venerable show featuring stunning video from ecosystems around the world. At the time of the show’s inception in 1982, he was working for the World Wildlife Fund.Lovejoy’s research brought him to the Amazon in the 1960s and he became a passionate advocate for tropical rainforests. He helped run a project in Brazil to protect and restore threatened forest fragments.The National Geographic Society gave Lovejoy a grant in 1971 to study rainforest birds in the Amazon and he played various roles with the society in the five decades that followed.“To know Tom was to know an extraordinary scientist, professor, adviser and unyielding champion for our planet,” Jill Tiefenthaler, National Geographic’s chief executive officer wrote in a blog post.He also served stints at the Smithsonian Institution, at the World Bank and as a science and environment adviser under several different presidents."}, {"title": "Major Snowstorm, High Winds Shut 111-Mile Stretch Of California Highway In Sierra Nevada", "text": "A blizzard with winds up to 100 mph in the Sierra Nevada closed down a 111-mile stretch of a California highway Sunday, making a mess of ski and holiday travel.Highway 50 from Placerville to Meyers in northern California was shut with “no estimated time of reopening,” Caltrans officials warned.Meanwhile, a 70-mile stretch of Interstate Highway 80, which was shut Christmas Day, also remained closed Sunday from Colfax in north central California to the Nevada border due to “zero visibility” caused by the storm, officials announced.Caltrans officials posted a brief video to show the dangerous conditions on I-80.The California Highway Patrol also posted an I-80 white-out video Saturday.The two highways are the key routes between the Lake Tahoe ski resorts close to the Nevada border and the San Francisco Bay area. Other sections of state highways have also been closed, along with a number of ski resorts.On the border at Reno, Nevada, weather officials warned Sunday in a tweet: “If you have the luxury of staying home and not having to drive today, take advantage. Currently gusting to 52 mph and a wind chill of 6 degrees at the office. It’s very icy out with dangerous driving conditions.”A 20-car pileup in Nevada closed Highway 395 in Washoe County on Sunday. California firefighters assisting in the accident called weather conditions “extreme.”The National Weather Service on Sunday issued a continued winter storm warning for the Sierra Nevada to Tuesday morning with “difficult to impossible travel conditions.” Meteorologists predicted up to eight feet of snow over the mountains in that time.Travelers were advised to pack tire chains, warm winter clothes and extra food and water.While dangerous, the snow is good news for California’s long-running drought. The state in October recorded its driest year in nearly a century.The snowpack in the Sierra was at dangerously low levels, but the state Department of Water Resources reported Friday that it was between 114% and 137% of normal across the range with more snow expected.In other bad news in the state, Highway 1 in southern California was closed due to a rock slide."}, {"title": "High Wind Postpones Launch Of NASA’s Newest Space Telescope", "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

They have large, cartoonish orange beaks and distinctive white plumage along their upper wings that resembles a splattered snowball.News of the sighting sent birders flocking to the area. One of them, Nick Lund, the advocacy and outreach coordinator for Maine Audubon, blogged about the experience on his website, called “The Birdist.” Lund had been participating in a Christmas bird count in southern Maine when he received a text from a colleague that said “Steller’s was just found.”Lund abandoned the organized bird count, hopped in the car with some fellow birders and drove the two hours south.“We pull up to the tiny, private beach where the bird was last seen to the dreaded ‘you just missed it!’” Lund wrote on his blog. “A birder’s nightmare. It flew upriver somewhere and no one knows where it is.”With their car nearly out of gas, the group drove off in hopes of catching a glimpse. Eventually, they received word that the bird had been spotted at Dighton Rock State Park.“We go, park haphazardly, and there it is, across the river with a bunch of Bald Eagles. Holy shit. We’re screaming,” Lund wrote. “An absolute dream to be all of a sudden standing in this random park in southern Massachusetts looking at a wild, rare Russian monster.”On their way home, the group stopped to purchase a bottle of Russian vodka to “honor our visiting Russian comrade.”This bird of prey’s odyssey thousands of miles from home has captivated scientists and enthusiasts. As The New York Times reported in November, the lost eagle has been slowly makings its way east across North America. It was first spotted along the Denali highway in southeastern Alaska in August 2020, and more recently in eastern Canada. It is even believed to have been sighted in Texas in the spring.“We’ve never had one here in this area of the world: the Northeast coast of North America or Massachusetts,” Andrew Vitz, a state ornithologist, told The Boston Globe. “This is like the bird of the decade for people around here.”Birds turning up outside their normal range, known as avian vagrancy, is relatively common, often the result of an animal getting lost or blown off course in a storm.Vitz told the Globe that the eagle appears to be in good health and there is no plan to tag or capture it.“It’s probably trying to find some familiar faces out there — others of its own species,” he said.The total population of Steller’s sea eagles is estimated at 4,000 to 7,000 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the bird as “vulnerable.”"}, {"title": "California Sues Walmart Over Disposal Of Hazardous Waste", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Retail giant Walmart illegally dumps more than 1 million batteries, aerosol cans of insect killer and other products, toxic cleaning supplies, electronic waste, latex paints and other hazardous waste into California landfills each year, state prosecutors alleged Monday in a lawsuit that the company labeled “unjustified.”“As we shop the brightly packed aisles there are products that will never make it into the cart — returned, damaged or pulled from the shelves for a variety of reasons,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta.“When a big box store disposes of unwanted goods, just like the rest of us, they need to do so properly. Unfortunately, Walmart — the largest company in the world by revenue — has failed to do that on a grand scale here in California,” Bonta said.The attorney general’s office settled a previous similar lawsuit in 2010 in which Walmart, which operates more than 300 stores in California, paid $25 million and agreed to stop the dumping into local landfills that are not equipped to contain the hazardous products.It paid $1.25 million to Missouri in 2012 to settle a similar lawsuit.And in 2013, the company pleaded guilty to six federal misdemeanors of negligently discharging a pollutant into drains in 16 California counties, part of an $81 million deal that also included charges in Missouri.Company spokesman Randy Hargrove said Walmart will fight the “unjustified lawsuit” filed Monday.“The state is demanding a level of compliance regarding waste disposal from our stores of common household products and other items that goes beyond what is required by law,” Hargrove said. He said a judge was ready to sign off in 2018 on Walmart’s compliance under the 2010 settlement until the attorney general’s office started a new investigation with “new rules” in a bid to force a new settlement.More than 3,800 audits overseen by the attorney general’s office since 2010 found that Walmart’s trash compactors “contain at most 0.4% of items of potential concern,” compared to a statewide average of 3%, Hargrove said: “Our compactors are far cleaner than the state average.”Bonta said Walmart’s own inspections show it illegally disposes of nearly 80 tons of such waste each year, which his office estimated amounts to more than 1 million individual items.“Pesticides, electronics, household hazardous waste must be disposed of properly, or they can be released into our air, our water and soil resulting in a number of negative health outcomes — including cancer, neurological disorders, asthma, or learning disabilities,” California Department of Toxic Substances Control Director Meredith Williams said at a news conference announcing the lawsuit.The state did 58 inspections in 13 counties of trash compactors taken from Walmart stores from 2015 to this year. In every case they found dozens of products that count as hazardous waste, medical waste or customer records with personal information, Bonta said.The attorney general’s office was joined in the lawsuit by Williams’ agency and the district attorneys of Alameda, Fresno, Monterey, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Joaquin, Solano, Tulare, and Yolo counties in filing the lawsuit.By contrast with Walmart, Bonta said other large retailers have disposal practices that comply with state laws “to different degrees, some with great compliance.”“It’s not rocket science,” he said. “You can’t be sending these hazardous waste products into the general stream of sanitation. It’s dangerous, it’s unhealthy.”Williams added that “other companies manage to comply with those laws,” while Walmart has even more means and incentive based on its prior violations.“So it’s really quite astounding that they continue to violate these hazardous waste control laws,” she said."}, {"title": "EPA Reverses Trump’s Fuel Mileage Rules On New Cars", "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency tightened fuel mileage rules on new cars and light-duty trucks Monday, reversing a Trump-era policy and signaling how Joe Biden’s administration may end up cutting emissions while its efforts to pass a climate law stall in Congress.The new rule will require automakers to achieve an average of at least 55 miles per gallon fleetwide by 2026, a sizable increase over the standard of 40.4 mpg set during Donald Trump’s presidency.Though that two-digit difference seems small, the Trump-era rule — itself a rollback finalized during the pandemic last year of the standards set under Barack Obama’s administration — took a 10-digit toll on the climate. The standard set the stage for American automobiles to pump an additional 1 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere over their life spans on the road. That nearly equals the annual emissions of Japan, the world’s fifth-largest source of planet-heating carbon dioxide.Automobile tailpipes spew the largest share of the United States’ climate-changing pollution, in addition to loads of fine particulate matter that trigger breathing problems and shorten lives particularly in neighborhoods near highways.“We followed the science, we listened to stakeholders, and we are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet — and save families money at the same time,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.The EPA estimates that by midcentury, the new standards will avert more than 3 billion tons of planet-warming emissions — more than half of the total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in 2019.The rule serves as a sort of stopgap measure, meant to make vehicles as efficient as possible through the next four years before enacting more aggressive regulations aimed at decarbonizing the U.S. auto fleet by the mid-2030s. The rule was pushed forward at an unusually hasty pace to ensure that the regulation was complete by December, allowing it to come into force for 2023 vehicle models.“You can never go back and get the reduction I’d helped set for 2021 and 2022. We lost those two years under Trump,” said Jeff Alson, a former senior engineer and policy adviser to the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, who had helped write the Obama-era regulations. “This rulemaking recaptures what would have been the lost year of 2023.”The final rule is actually slightly stronger than what the EPA initially outlined in August, with standards for 2026 models about 6% higher than what the agency first proposed. It’s also forecast to deliver deeper cuts than what the original Obama regulation would have achieved.Still, it’s only a first step, Alson said. He said he expects the EPA to complete another, far more aggressive automobile standard for vehicles made after 2027 by the end of 2022 or the start of 2023.“The agency got about as much as they could get under these four years, and the real key will be in that second rulemaking for 2027,” Alson said. “That’s the chance the Biden administration has to go way beyond what Obama did and start to seriously achieve the type of levels we need.”Monday’s announcement comes as Biden faces mounting pressure to take unilateral action to confront the climate threat. Over the weekend, after months of contentious negotiations, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced he would not vote for Biden’s social spending package, putting a dagger through what many see as a rare opportunity for Democrats to pass meaningful climate legislation. Although key climate provisions had already been stripped from Biden’s Build Back Better Act during negotiations, it still included more than $550 billion in clean energy and climate investments.“I hope that Congress will one day pass laws to slow the climate crisis,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement Sunday. “Until then, it’s up to the administration to take every action possible, as quickly as possible.”CORRECTION: This story was updated to correct the misspelling of Jeff Alson's name."}, {"title": "Leather Jackets That Are Ethically Sourced, According To Experts", "text": "The fashion industry is responsible for more than 4% of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions and is one of the largest contributors to planetary waste. It’s also notorious for operating a supply chain that’s incredibly opaque and riddled with unethical labor conditions, poverty wages and toxic product sourcing.This is all according Remake and their 2021 Fashion Accountability Report, an annual initiative that consults and scores fashion companies on rigorous criteria such as traceability, environmental justice and diversity.Katrina Caspelich is the director of marketing for Remake, a nonprofit organization that empowers citizens to advocate for fair wages and eliminate environmental injustice in the fashion industry. Caspelich spoke with HuffPost about what sustainable fashion really means and what it needs to look like in order to be truly ethical.“Sustainable fashion usually means eco-friendly practices in the fashion industry, referencing the approach of designing, producing and consuming clothes that respect the planet by causing little to no damage, and therefore sustaining the environment,” Casepelich said. “We define this term holistically by looking at both the planetary and human impact. We look at the industry’s practice of sustaining the healthy lives of the people who make our clothes through living wages, safe work conditions and maker well-being.”For us consumers, this means gaining a better understanding of the oft complex supply chain and taking the initiative to know where our clothes come from at every step of its process, from the raw materials being used to make a garment to the moment an item gets into your hands. But according to Orsola de Castro, the founder and global creative director of Fashion Revolution (one of the largest initiatives that campaigns for fashion industry accountability) this can be more difficult than it seems.“Understanding the supply chain implies transparency and public disclosure. The fashion industry is deregulated, meaning that it has no obligation to actually give its customers the information on the provenance, contents and materials,” de Castro said.De Castro described leather as one of the most problematic materials. It also happens to be largely in demand.“Leather is linked to deforestation. It’s also by far the most polluting processes when it comes to treating and dyeing, and one of the biggest supply chain offenders. For instance, in Bangladesh, the leather tanneries are extraordinarily dangerous for the people who work in them,” de Castro said.The complexity and sheer size of these systemic problems can seem nearly impossible to fix. But de Castro and Caspelich encourage us to push beyond the apathy that we may feel about something that seems larger than ourselves for the exact reason that environmental devastation does affect more than just us.“We are all in the supply chain. The minute we buy something, we take responsibility for that object and the history it will have for itself after,” de Castro said.“A single clothing item’s footprint indelibly molds our land, our water, our air — and each other,” Caspelich agreed.So what then are practical steps we can make when consuming fashion moving forward?“When you think about it, we already take quite a bit of time when looking for a product. We look for the size, color, style. What we now need to do as consumers is input a new kind of information: our research.”De Castro told us what to look for in this research process.“In my opinion, leather has to be 100% traceable, vegetable-dyed and treated without the use of chromium sulfate. But, nothing beats secondhand when it comes to leather because there’s so much around.”Casepelich also said to be wary of greenwashing, a tactic that uses vague terms to appear more ethical to consumers.“Unfortunately with the rise in popularity of the term ‘sustainable,’ many fashion brands have taken the public’s movement to invest in sustainable companies as an opportunity to cash in on people’s concern for the environment and the makers sewing their clothing. Here are a few ways to avoid the trap:Is the brand using language in a way that markets itself as being environmentally and socially concerned without offering detailed stats and information to back it up?In terms of ethical leather jackets that are on the market now, Casepelich recommends Reformation as a good place to start.“We love Reformation’s leather jackets ― they’re cool, classic and definitely made to last. While on the pricier side, they are an investment piece,” Caspelich said.If you have more questions or want to know ways that you can support the sustainable fashion movement, Remake offers a guide and resources to assist. You can also see how well fashion brands are rated in their brand directory.In the meantime, if you’re on the hunt for a leather jacket that you won’t feel guilty about adding to your collection, keep reading for the list below that includes jackets made from alternative materials, recycled leather and truly one-of-a-kind vintage pieces.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

The toll was expected to increase because several towns and villages remained out of reach due to downed communications and power outages although massive clean-up and repair efforts were underway.Many died due to falling trees and collapsing walls, flash flood and landslides. A 57-year-old man was found dead hanging from a tree branch and a woman was blown away by the wind and died in Negros Occidental province, police said.Governor Arlene Bag-ao of Dinagat Islands, among the southeastern provinces first hit by the typhoon, said Rai’s ferocity on her island province of more than 130,000 was worse than that of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful and deadliest typhoons on record and which devastated the central Philippines in November 2013 but did not inflict any casualties in Dinagat.“If it was like being in a washing machine before, this time there was like a huge monster that smashed itself everywhere, grabbed anything like trees and tin roofs and then hurled them everywhere,” Bag-ao told The Associated Press by telephone. “The wind was swirling north to south to east and west repeatedly for six hours. Some tin roof sheets were blown away then were tossed back.”At least 14 villagers died and more than 100 others were injured by flying tin roofs, debris and glass shards and were treated in makeshift surgery rooms in damaged hospitals in Dinagat, Bag-ao said. Many more would have died if thousands of residents had not been evacuated from high-risk villages.Like several other typhoon-hit provinces, Dinagat remained without electricity and communications and many residents in the province, where the roofs of most houses and buildings were ripped off, needed construction materials, food and water. Bag-ao and other provincial officials traveled to nearby regions that had cellphone signals to seek aid and coordinate recovery efforts with the national government.More than 700,000 people were lashed by the typhoon in central island provinces, including more than 400,000 who had to be moved to emergency shelters. Thousands of residents were rescued from flooded villages, including in Loboc town in hard-hit Bohol province, where residents were trapped on roofs and trees to escape from rising floodwaters.Coast guard ships ferried 29 American, British, Canadian, Swiss, Russian, Chinese and other tourists who were stranded on Siargao Island, a popular surfing destination that was devastated by the typhoon, officials said.Emergency crews were scrambling to restore electricity in 227 cities and towns, officials said. Power has been restored in only 21 areas so far. Cellphone connections in more than 130 cities and towns were cut by the typhoon but at least 106 had been reconnected by Monday, officials said. Two local airports remained closed except for emergency flights, but most others have reopened, the civil aviation agency said.Bag-ao and other officials were concerned that their provinces may run out of fuel, which was in high demand due to the use of temporary power generators, including those used for refrigerated warehouses with large amounts of coronavirus vaccine stocks. Officials delivered vaccine shipments to many provinces for an intensified immunization campaign, which was postponed last week due to the typhoon.At the Vatican, Pope Francis expressed his closeness Sunday to the people of the Philippines, referencing the typhoon “that destroyed many homes.”About 20 storms and typhoons annually batter the Philippines, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. The Southeast Asian archipelago also lies along the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” region, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."}, {"title": "A ‘Green’ Energy Project Leaves A Mississippi Town Gasping For Air", "text": "GLOSTER, Miss. — Carmella Wren-Causey knew something was wrong as soon as she returned to her hometown last year, a place where she’d slept on her grandmother’s screened porch to smell the sweet, crisp fragrance of longleaf pines on summer evenings. Though it had been years since Wren-Causey, 60, had smoked her last cigarette, she was having a harder and harder time breathing.Within months of moving into a small, prefabricated home on property her great-grandparents first bought nearly a century ago, even just tending her garden left her so dizzy she felt faint. Dragging the garbage the short walk up to the road required at least three breaks to catch her breath. Hoisting herself into her Nissan pickup became a process: one leg, a gargled inhale, a lean, then the other leg. She could barely sleep at night and recently started going to bed hooked up to an oxygen tank.She had struggled with breathing problems before. But now her doctor had to increase her medication. She joked that her inhaler had become her best friend. When her two beloved spunky pugs Rayray and Tiny – her “babies” she took everywhere – died suddenly, just three weeks apart, it became a little too true. The dogs had also struggled to breathe, wheezing with anguish shortly before dying.“The truth is, you got people around here that stay sick. You got people around here that has to use asthma pumps that didn’t have respiratory problems before,” Wren-Causey said, weeping.“I go to bed, my lungs hurt,” she said. “I wake up, my lungs hurt. It’s horrible.”Wren-Causey lives less than a mile from the mill where the British utility giant Drax turns towering tree trunks into wood pellets the size of vitamin capsules, which are then shipped to the United Kingdom to be burned in power plants. When the company opened the mill here eight years ago, tiny Gloster, with its shrinking population of about 800, became part of the $52 billion global supply chain for wood-fired electricity. The industry is on pace to grow 6% or more per year this decade.To some lifelong residents of Gloster, the Drax plant was a godsend, the first sign of life since 2002, when the lumber mill that was once the town’s economic heart closed and left a once-thriving main street a ghost town.To others, the facility was a curse. Feeding it meant reducing local forests that once teemed with deer and squirrels to plantations of wimpy saplings. And many in this mostly Black community, where median incomes barely hit $10,000 a year, say it has polluted the air with disease-causing gases called volatile organic compounds without delivering them promised new jobs.Perhaps counterintuitively, the push to build the Drax mill and feed it with Southern forests is the product of policies meant to stop global warming.European Union and British regulators decided that emissions from wood-fired power plants would not count the same as pollution from fossil fuel generators, making companies like Drax eligible for billions in subsidies for green energy. The firm received nearly $1.1 billion in clean power subsidies last year alone.Seeing how quickly the industry grew off government funding meant to cut emissions, scientists and activists mobilized to stop its expansion, complaining that the whole thing was built off faulty premises: Trees regrow, but it takes decades to centuries, and burning wood can release more planet-heating gases than coal because you need much more to generate the same amount of power. But it was too late: A multi-billion-dollar industry had already put down roots and cultivated powerful political allies.In the U.S., federal incentives to build wood-burning power plants are much smaller, and their share of the country’s electricity generation has declined over the past seven years. But states, particularly in the South, have lavished tax breaks on firms that harvest and process wood to send it across the ocean. And the industry has boosters inside the Biden administration such as Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and a spurious but catchy new sales pitch promising that new technologies will render it capable of pulling more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.“When the industry claims it’s carbon neutral, it’s saying we recognize there’s CO2 coming out of the smokestacks, but it was instantaneously offset by CO2 uptake somewhere else, and therefore it’s not in the atmosphere,” said Mary Booth, an ecologist and founder of the Partnership for Policy Integrity, an environmental research and advocacy nonprofit. “But that’s not what’s happening. If you burn a tree, it emits carbon right away. And if you grow a tree, it takes up carbon over a long time.”Burning plant matter for energy predates even Homo sapiens, as studies show earlier species of hominids used it for fire. But the modern biomass industry, which burns plants or plant-based synthetic fuels to power generators and produce power, did not gain prominence until the 1970s, as the oil crisis spurred interest in alternatives to fossil fuels.The wood-fired power sector really started booming in the second decade of the 21st century. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had, for decades, advised countries to attribute carbon from chopping down trees to the land-use sector, not energy, to avoid double counting. That meant countries didn’t have to report the emissions from wood-burning power plants as part of their overall carbon footprint.There were various justifications for doing so that have shifted wildly over the years. But one of the more straightforward, if perhaps too ecologically simplistic, explanations was this: Scrap wood or dead trees left to rot would emit carbon anyway, so turning that biomass into fuel that could supplant fossil fuels would balance out the atmospheric pollution ledger.In reality, it set the stage for creating an accounting convention that would allow some of the richest nations that contributed the most to the cumulative carbon mess in the atmosphere to boost their struggling timber industries and inflate their green bona fides.The methodology reflected the long-standing view in Europe, where wood-burning furnaces and stoves are common, that wood was a renewable resource. So when the European Union adopted its 2009 Renewable Energy Directive — a plan to reach 20% renewable energy by 2020 to help the bloc adhere to the world’s first climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol — it followed a long tradition of giving wood-fired power plants the same emissions-free status as wind and solar. As a result, coal-dependent countries like Britain and Germany began heavily subsidizing wood burning.This was despite the fact that burning freshly cut wood chips, which are wet and far less energy-dense than fossil fuels, can emit between 40% and 60% more carbon per megawatt-hour of electricity than coal. Wood pellets like those the Drax plant produces are dried and therefore more efficient, and generate fewer emissions when they’re burned despite spewing more gases where they’re produced.“Sustainable biomass is renewable because of the closed carbon cycle created when trees grow and take CO2 from the atmosphere. Whether the wood is used for bioenergy or these trees naturally decompose, the same amount of CO2 is released into the atmosphere,” said Ali Lewis, a Drax spokesperson, in a lengthy email. “The cycle remains in balance because the working forests which supply the low-grade wood used for biomass are replanted and these growing trees absorb more carbon.”The problem, the industry’s critics say, is that cycle’s timeframe. It takes at least 82 years for a biomass plant’s regrown forests to lower that facility’s carbon footprint to that of a coal plant. And that’s the best-case scenario outlined by a peer-reviewed emissions calculator tool created by Natural Resources Canada, a government agency. Even after 100 years, wood-fired electricity could not close the emissions gap with a natural gas plant, the calculator data show.Yet by the time this became clear enough to build some kind of political momentum, biomass had not only grown into an industrial heavyweight, it had split the traditional green voting bloc in the EU, attracting support from the usually climate-conscious Scandinavians who also have large timber industries.The reporting metric also allowed Europe to credit its existing wood-burning operations as renewable energy, effectively juicing its green energy numbers to make the continent look much more ecologically balanced than it actually was.Biomass had an extra appeal that has become a more prominent industry talking point in recent years. Unlike wind and solar, which can operate sporadically, wood-fired plants can run as long as there’s something to burn, providing the reliable baseload electricity we expect from fossil fuels.The EU embraced wood at the same time the U.S. leaned into the Northeast’s hydraulic fracturing boom and replaced its coal plants with cheap and abundant natural gas. This presented an opportunity for states across the forested South to revive the timber industry, then on the decline, by welcoming companies that would feed Europe’s growing appetite for pellets.Gloster’s Drax plant became one of the largest pellet mills in the U.S. when it opened eight years ago.In 2013, when wood pellet exports from the U.S. doubled from the previous year to 3.2 million tons, Drax chopped down the pines and oaks that once covered the hill behind Blackmon Hole, a small Black-owned trailer park five minutes from downtown Gloster.“I used to go hunting up there,” said Pete, a Blackmon Hole resident who declined to give his last name as he sipped a Bud Lite and tinkered with a new transmission in an old gray Ford Crown Victoria. “Now ain’t nothing coming around with all that noise.”On that late Wednesday afternoon in early December, the maze of towering metal chutes that make up the mill was clanking and humming, a cacophony occasionally joined by the roar of semi-trucks carrying flatbeds of pine logs. A grayish-white cloud billowed from a smokestack.Air pollution from wood pellet plants comes from various sources. There’s the exhaust from a steady convoy of trucks. And, perhaps worst of all, the kiln that dries chipped trees to turn them into wood pellets, spewing loads of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, that contribute to smog and ozone pollution; aggravate asthma and other lung conditions; cause cancer; and trigger itchy eyes and skin. In between, too, there are additional VOCs sent into the air when the hammermills shred trees and the pellets are fully processed.The wood pellet industry and regulators almost never account for that pollution in permitting, according to a landmark 2018 study by the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group.In the middle of the gravel driveway that cuts through Blackmon Hole is a yellow sign that reads: “Slow: Children Playing.” Once school let out, at least half a dozen kids chased each other around the lawn between the trailers.Heading up the hill toward the chainlink fence between the homes and the Drax facility, the air takes on a sharp, peppery flavor. It stung the inside of my nostrils before the smell even registered. My eyes watered and I sneezed; later on, my lungs felt heavy, like an occasional smoker might feel after a rare cigarette.Jasmine Jenkins lives at the edge of the park, with her daughters, 8 and 3, and her son, 5.“They’ve had allergies ever since they were born,” Jenkins, 28, said while standing on the steps of her home one night after returning from work. “One of my kids breaks out in hives every two to three months.”Several feet away stood her neighbor Shirley Bland, who, after 30 years living here, said she only started finding a daily layer of residue on her car once the plant opened.“It must be what they put up in the air,” said the 57-year-old grandmother. “I keep feeling out of breath.”The Environmental Integrity Project report found that Drax’s plant was emitting more than three times as many VOCs as the company was legally permitted to emit.Last fall, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality fined Drax $2.5 million and demanded the company install new catalyzing technology to help disintegrate more of the pollution before it enters the atmosphere. An agency spokesperson sent a link to the fine but did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about whether Drax had fully fulfilled the regulators’ demands.Drax declined my request to visit the plant but said it installed catalytic oxidizers in Gloster and two plants in Louisiana this past summer.It was the highest fine any wood-pellet plant in the U.S. has incurred, according to the Dogwood Alliance, a North Carolina-based nonprofit that advocates against expanding the biomass industry. But such penalties are not widely publicized, particularly by the states promoting the industry, making it difficult to confirm. It took months for watchdog groups that track the industry, including Dogwood Alliance, to put out a press release about the fine.Organizers from the Dogwood Alliance came to Gloster in June to hold a town-hall meeting with residents. Upward of 80 people showed up, many complaining about breathing and skin problems.The gathering drew backlash from local officials. In a post on Facebook, Mayor Jerry Norwood warned that rabble-rousing could drive Drax out of town and take its purchasing power, which helped offset the cost of water, gas and electricity in Gloster, with it.“If by some chance a big lawsuit should happen and Drax decides to close [its] gates please be prepared for your utility rates to triple,” Norwood wrote.The warning seems to have resonated. When organizers Erniko Brown and the Rev. Michael Malcom returned months later, about four people came to their information session, expressing fear about their bills going up.“It’s bullying,” said Malcom, a pastor and environmental justice advocate in Birmingham, Alabama. “I hate a bully. And that’s what this is.”The turnout to the activists’ Dec. 3 town hall meeting was higher, with about a little over a dozen attendees. But at least six of them, including the mayor, came to express concerns that the campaign against Drax threatened Gloster’s economic future.“I’ve been a Gloster resident all my life. I grew up here. And I don’t want my town to go to dirt,” said Cissy Fenn, 68, a former school teacher.Brandy Hamilton, one of the Dogwood Alliance’s lead organizers, said her group had no intention of shutting down Drax and told Fenn to lower her voice, asking her to be “mindful that everyone has high emotions.”“You’ve been in Gloster all your life,” she told Fenn, who is white. “I’ve been Black all my life.”Fenn looked shocked by the implication that racism had anything to do with the Drax plant. Her husband, Reggie Fenn, 67, spoke up: “Look, we all bleed red.”“We all have things that make us sensitive to things,” Hamilton said.“It’s not a Black and white issue at all for me,” Cissy Fenn said. “It’s survival for us.”“It’s survival for everybody,” Hamilton replied.Doug Iverson, who once ran a mill that turned grain into feed pellets for livestock, asked Hamilton where she was from. She told him Charlotte, North Carolina. He questioned how the air here could be worse than in such a big city.“You know, I grew up in this little town, and there was always dust around,” he said. “Once a week I had to dust every piece of furniture you could wipe your hand on.”“I know you’re not dusting the houses over in Blackmon Hole,” Hamilton said.Once Norwood, the mayor, joined in, the argument quickly devolved into shouting. Reggie Fenn walked out, then Iverson. Brown, pulling rank, asked her colleague Hamilton to leave and cool off.Jerry White, 75, the president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he doesn’t think “race was the main issue,” but hoped Drax would take additional steps to reduce pollution and help those living in Blackmon Hole.“We can still find common ground,” he said, visibly drained after the meeting. “I’m trying to look forward to the future. I think about the children, especially in Blackmon Hole.”On another evening this month in Blackmon Hole, Brown stopped Bland’s grandson — the only person that anyone in or near the trailer park seemed to know who had gotten a job with Drax, working as a janitor — as he drove his car away from his grandmother’s trailer. Brown confronted him about the air pollution.“To me, it could be pollen,” said Bland’s grandson, who declined to give his name.“This ain’t pollen season,” Brown said, gesturing to the silhouette of the plant in front of a pink dusk sky. “We know where it comes from.”Others in the community have sought employment at the plant, but say they were repeatedly rejected.“They said people could get jobs there, but I keep putting in applications and I don’t get no job,” said Debra Blackmon-Butler, 61, who is related to the families living in Blackmon Hole but lives about a mile away. Instead she drives to Baton Rouge for work, more than an hour south.In an interview after the heated debate at the town hall, Mayor Norwood said those complaining about the plant were probably unqualified to work there and accused them of trying to extort Drax for money.“This is a very uneducated town,” he said outside the meeting. “They were talking about the number of people from Gloster that work at Drax. But has anybody asked them how many of them can pass a drug test? You have to be drug-tested to get a job there.”Drax said one-fifth of its 63-person workforce at the facility lives in Gloster.Drax, he said, has helped keep this tiny town afloat. The company paid “almost half a million dollars” to the school district this year, and paid nearly $83,000 for gas, providing the town a surplus that prevented it from raising utility rates when the price of natural gas spiked this fall, the mayor said. Drax did not confirm how much it pays in utilities but said its local taxes amount to about $1 million and listed a series of regional charities and schools to which it donates.“Where do we get this environmental racism from, and why is that always the narrative? Why isn’t it that these companies picked this poor town and tried to help?” said Norwood, who is Black. “That’s all I’ve seen them do.”He said he has talked to another timber-related company about restarting another mill that first closed 19 years ago when Georgia-Pacific left town (the manufacturing giant briefly reopened the lumber plant in 2005 to help process wood debris from Hurricane Katrina, then shuttered for good in 2008).If Gloster’s reputation is as a place with “Black-white racial issues,” Norwood said, “they’re gonna say there’s no way we’re coming down with this foolishness going on.”Attracting companies to Gloster, a town in one of just two Mississippi counties without the four-lane highways trucks need to get products to market, does come at a price, Norwood admitted. Drax received a 10-year tax break from both the town and county. Such incentives are typical for municipalities trying to lure corporations, but they have yielded unfavorable outcomes once the credits end and the corporation relocates.Drax declined to say whether it would consider leaving town after the tax deal expires, but noted it plans to dramatically increase its production in the coming years.Norwood said that, even if Drax leaves after another few years, “they still would have helped the town.”Yet the company could end up causing an exodus, too. After years of taking her now-teenage daughter to a clinic for allergy shots every Thursday, Chiquita Cain, 33, moved last month to Baton Rouge, where she’s closer to work and further from the environment she said has sickened her kids and left her with constantly irritated skin.“It’s just itchy all day, every day,” Cain said. She said she wasn’t alone: “My cousin has asthma real bad. My mom has bronchitis. My sister gets bad, bad headaches, so bad she needed to see a neurologist.”Robert Weatherspoon, 64, broke into tears describing how it takes him an hour and a half each morning to clear the mucus from his chest.“You’re coughing, you’re coughing, you’re coughing, like something hanging up there,” he said. “I thought I’d get used to the pain. But every morning, honest to God, I don’t think I’m going to make it.”While U.S. exports of wood pellets have roughly doubled since 2014, the amount of electricity Americans generated from wood has fallen steadily since peaking that year. Today, biomass makes up just over 1% of U.S. electricity.The largest wood-burning power plant in the U.S. opened in Gainesville, Florida, in 2013, and almost immediately caused a public scandal over costs. The deal to buy power from the 103-megawatt Deerhaven Renewable Generating Station proved so controversial — at roughly $70 million per year over three decades, electricity bills quickly rose – that the city spent $750 million to buy out the remainder of the contract.In the U.K., by contrast, the 4,000-megawatt Drax Power Station — a massive coal- and wood-burning complex in northeastern England — supplies about 7% of the U.K.’s electricity with millions of tons of wood, much of which comes from forests in the American South.This week, Drax unveiled plans to spend over $53 million to start work on new carbon capture machines that the company said will catch and store 8 million metric tons of CO2 per year. Already, the company calls its plant the “largest decarbonization project in Europe” because it had swapped much of its coal-fired production for wood.The investment news came just a few months after Drax announced a deal with the U.S. engineering firm Bechtel on projects that would equip wood-burning power plants across North America with carbon capture technology.Will Gardiner, Drax’s chief executive, said the deals demonstrate “Drax’s commitment to deliver a vital technology which is urgently needed to address the climate crisis.”“It’s no longer enough to reduce emissions,” he said in a statement. “The world has got to start removing carbon from the atmosphere if we are to avert this climate crisis.”Since trees suck up huge amounts of carbon naturally, Drax and others in the industry say that equipping their plants with technology to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks and store it underground will make biomass power a potential source of negative emissions. As governments set net-zero targets — points at which the amount of carbon their countries absorb equals or exceeds the CO2 they emit — demand for quantifiable ways to pull carbon from the atmosphere is growing.But the U.N.’s IPCC itself acknowledged in its most recent report that the concept of bioenergy with carbon capture “rests on the premise that bioenergy production is carbon neutral.”That, Booth said, renders Drax’s claims “bogus.”“Burning trees and using CCS can no more deliver negative emissions than burning trees without CCS can deliver carbon-neutral emissions,” she said. “It’s the same problem. Trees don’t grow back that quickly.”Drax’s negative-emissions effort may instead be a play for more subsidies. In a recent blog post, the Forest Defenders Alliance, a European environmental group, noted that Drax’s existing subsidies — totaling nearly $2.7 million per day — are set to phase out in five years. So the company, the post stated, is looking for a new “expensive scam” to get “more money out of the public.”A report Drax commissioned and published in March proposes that the U.K. government continue providing subsidies both for power generation and carbon capture after 2027.There are other issues to relying on wood energy at scale. If the world were to supply just another 2% of its electricity demand with wood, it would require doubling the annual harvest of wood, according to Timothy Searchinger, a senior researcher at Princeton University. Providing 3.5% of America’s energy demand would require doubling the number of trees cut down.Other ways to provide negative emissions, such as direct air capture technology or soil management techniques, wouldn’t require felling forests that are actively sucking carbon as it is. Searchinger compared the proposition to exercise.“If you eat lots of sugar but work out, you could be reasonably healthy,” he said. “But if you don’t eat lots of sugar and work out, you’ll be healthier.”If the cost of capturing carbon with technology comes down, he said, you’d be better off burning coal or gas at a power plant than wood, since then you’d get a lot more energy per unit anyway.Investors seem to be doubting Drax’s claims, too. In October, the S&P dropped the company from its Global Clean Energy Index. This month, Citi downgraded its stock from “buy” to “hold.”There are some potential places where limited biomass energy could be useful, such as in California, where dead trees in drought-stricken forests need to be cleared anyway to reduce the harmful effects of wildfires, said Holly Jean Buck, a researcher at the University at Buffalo who studies negative emissions and decarbonization.“The best case for biomass is waste biomass,” Buck said. “We should think more about using waste biomass streams and less about for-purpose crops that could be used for other things, whether those be lumber to build houses or land that could be dedicated to other things.”(Drax, for its part, said about 40% of its wood does come from sawmill waste, citing data in its own annual report, and insisted the rest of its wood comes from trees that are “not suitable for other uses.”)Searchinger said the biomass industry’s tree plantations could only contribute to a negative emissions target if the world was actively reducing the amount of land used for agriculture. Instead, in most countries, old-growth woodlands such as the Amazon or Borneo’s rainforests are being felled to make way for cattle ranches and palm oil plantations.“The only way biomass becomes a potentially [carbon] negative contribution is in a world where we are actively reducing agricultural land and you have a choice as to whether you reforest that land or plant fast-growing woody plantations,” he said. “It’s entirely speculative, but depending on the assumptions you make, you could arguably get more benefit from the fast-growing biomass plantations.”He added: “There are these theoretical scenarios in which maybe this could be useful, but they’re sufficiently far in the future that they’re irrelevant right now.”The biomass industry is set to experience its fastest growth in East Asia during the second half of this decade. A report published last year found South Korea was so heavily subsidizing biomass plants that the industry was crowding wind and solar out of the power market. Japan, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with plans to burn residues from palm oil for electricity, threatening even further deforestation.In a February 2021 letter addressed to Biden, European, British, Japanese and Korean leaders, more than 500 scientists urged them “not to undermine both climate goals and the world’s biodiversity by shifting from burning fossil fuels to burning trees” and to “end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood.”“Trees are more valuable alive than dead both for climate and for biodiversity,” the letter read. “To meet future net zero emission goals, your governments should work to preserve and restore forests and not to burn them.”Wren-Causey feels like she can relate.“I want to live,” she said.And she has much to live for. She has her husband and young nieces she adores. She cares for an abandoned pony. She’s hoping to start a charity to help local kids, and once a week, she takes elderly women who can’t drive to the post office and bank.“But every night I’m in bed,” she said. “I’m praying and asking God to please let me wake up in the morning.”"}, {"title": "Rebuilding Tornado-Ravaged Kentucky Town Could Take Years", "text": "MAYFIELD, Ky. (AP) — Although his birthday is still a few days away, 60-year-old Harley Kelso knows what he’s getting from his sister.The retired truck driver, whose home and car were battered by last week’s tornado — one of dozens that ripped across the South and Midwest, killing at least 90 people — said his sister is bringing chainsaws and her two sons to his home in hard-hit Mayfield to cut apart a tree that’s resting on his family’s minivan.“I lost my car and the corner of my porch,” Kelso said, sporting a T-shirt that read World’s Greatest Papa. “I’m just glad everyone in the neighborhood survived.”Such gratitude may sound odd in the aftermath of a long-track tornado that demolished huge parts of Mayfield, but it’s a common refrain these days in this tight-knit community of 10,000 people.Even with his minivan crumpled under a giant tree, most of his front yard hanging from its roots, smashed windows and a home with no power or running water, Kelso says he’s well aware that things could have been worse — and resolute if not downright upbeat about the task ahead.“I’m going to bring a hot breakfast to my daughter,” he said with a smile, clutching a bag of breakfast tacos dropped off by one of the dozens of volunteers combing the neighborhood, offering a hot meal or a cold drink.President Joe Biden, who visited the community Wednesday and described the damage as some of the worst he’s seen, vowed the full support of the federal government to help the town rebuild.“I intend to do whatever it takes as long as it takes to support your state, your local leaders, as you recover and rebuild, and you will recover and rebuild,” the president said, standing before a decimated town center.Among the biggest and most pressing challenges facing Mayfield and other devastated communities is removing the mountains of debris that the storms turned homes and businesses into, Kentucky Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett said.“This is going to be one of the largest pieces of the recovery,” Dossett said Thursday during a press conference at the state Capitol in Frankfort. “Debris removal is one of the most important pieces because it is part and parcel to rebuilding not just the city infrastructure, but for all of our homeowners.”In neighborhoods across the city, yards and streets are filled with debris: downed tree limbs, shingles, mangled children’s toys, mud-caked clothes. Trees that haven’t been uprooted completely have had upper branches shorn off. Others have crashed into cars or homes.Many houses have had roofs torn off or been pulled from their foundations. Others have been reduced to nothing more than a massive pile of bricks, insulation and splintered lumber.In the center of town, heavy equipment operators rumbled through the back-and-forth task of clearing piles of rubble that covered entire blocks. At what was once a steam-cleaning business, volunteers sifted through piles of debris to salvage what they could. Several steam cleaners stood at the edge of the pile.The damage and devastation in Mayfield is so severe that it could take years before the community returns to normal, said Chris Chiles, disaster response coordinator for the Danville, Virginia-based God’s Pit Crew, which has been aiding storm-ravaged communities for more than two decades.“There’s a ton of work that needs to be done,” Chiles said. “I’ve been doing this for 14 years all over the country, and it’s hard to get much worse than this.“It’ll take a long time. Years, unfortunately.”When a town that has lived through such a catastrophic event does finally get rebuilt and back on its feet, Chiles said, it’s often stronger and more close-knit than before.“The loss of life is horrific, but sometimes neighbors don’t know each other and things like this bring people together,” he said.Still, not everyone is prepared to rebuild.Chris Eigenrauch, 49, whose home was among those badly battered by the storm, said the prospect of rebuilding an entire community is simply too daunting. He said he’s considering moving to neighboring Illinois, where several of his relatives live.“It’s going to take months, if not years,” he said. “I just plan on leaving. For the ones who are staying, I hope God helps them rebuild.”Kelso, who works 20 hours a week as a short-order cook, isn’t sure how long it will take to get his own home back to normal, let alone the devastated community. But his confidence is unwavering.“This is a tough community,” he said. “We’ll come together.”___Associated Press reporter Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report from Louisville, Kentucky."}, {"title": "Workers Sue Tornado-Hit Candle Factory For Not Letting Them Leave", "text": "MAYFIELD, Ky. (AP) — Survivors of a tornado that leveled a Kentucky candle factory, killing eight workers, have filed a lawsuit claiming their employer demonstrated “flagrant indifference” by refusing to allow employees to go home early as the storm approached the western Kentucky town.The lawsuit filed in state court accuses the company of violating Kentucky occupational safety and health workplace standards by keeping its staff at work. It seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Mayfield Consumer Products.A spokesman for the company has previously insisted that employees were free to leave anytime. The spokesman did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Thursday.The lawsuit claims the factory had “up to three and half hours before the tornado hit its place of business to allow its employees to leave its worksite as safety precautions.” The factory showed “flagrant indifference to the rights” of the workers by refusing to do so, the lawsuit said.An employee of the factory told The Associated Press on Tuesday that a supervisor threatened her with written disciplinary action if she went home early because storms were approaching.The employee, Haley Conder, also questioned why the company did not encourage workers to go home — or at least give them a better understanding of the danger — between a first tornado siren around 6 p.m. Friday and another one around 9 p.m., shortly before the tornado hit.The lawsuit was filed less than a week after the storms that began Friday night destroyed lives and property from Arkansas to Illinois and in parts of neighboring states, carving a more than 200-mile (320-kilometer) path through Kentucky alone.More than 100 people were working on candle orders when the twister flattened the Mayfield facility. The scale of the damage initially stoked fears that scores of workers could be found dead in the rubble. The company later said many employees who survived left the site and went to homes with no phone service, adding to the confusion over who was missing.Since then, all workers have been accounted for, according to state and local officials who have spoken to the company.Gov. Andy Beshear has said that Kentucky’s workplace safety agency would look into the eight deaths. That kind of investigation is routine whenever workers are killed on the job. The company has signaled that it welcomes a review by the state and will cooperate."}, {"title": "Unusual Hurricane-Force Winds Sweep Midwest, Leaving 5 Dead", "text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — At least five people died as a powerful and extremely unusual storm system swept across the Great Plains and Midwest amid unseasonably warm temperatures, spawning hurricane-force winds and possible tornadoes in Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota.In southeastern Minnesota, Olmsted County Sheriff’s Lt. Lee Rossman said a 65-year-old man was killed Wednesday night when a 40-foot tree blew onto him outside his home. In southwestern Kansas, blinding dust kicked up by the storms Wednesday led to two separate crashes that killed three people, Kansas Highway Patrol trooper Mike Racy said. And in eastern Iowa, a semitrailer was struck by high winds and rolled onto its side Wednesday evening, killing the driver, the Iowa State Patrol confirmed.The storm shifted north of the Great Lakes into Canada on Thursday, with high winds, snow and hazardous conditions continuing in the upper Great Lakes region, the National Weather Service said. More than 400,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Kansas, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks utility reports.A tornado was reported in southern Minnesota on Wednesday and, if confirmed, would be the state’s first on record in December. The small community of Hartland, Minnesota, might have been the hardest hit, with a reported 35 to 40 homes sustaining minor damage and a few businesses severely damaged, county Emergency Management Director Rich Hall said.The destructive weather system developed amid unprecedented warmth for December in the Plains and northern states. That included temperatures that rose to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) across southwestern Wisconsin on Wednesday evening. The Weather Company historian Chris Burt compared the heat to that of a “warm July evening.”“I can say with some confidence that this event (the heat and tornadoes) is among the most (if not THE most) anomalous weather event ever on record for the Upper Midwest,” Burt wrote in a Facebook post.The winds knocked down trees, tree limbs and nearly 150 power lines in northern and western Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. In the western Michigan village of Fruitport, high winds peeled back a portion of Edgewood Elementary School’s roof, leading officials to close all district schools Thursday.There were more than 20 tornado reports Wednesday in the Plains states, scattered mostly through eastern Nebraska and Iowa, based on preliminary reports to the Storm Prediction Center. The storm system led to the most reports of hurricane-force wind gusts — 75 mph (120 kph) or higher — on any day in the U.S. since 2004, the center said.“To have this number of damaging wind storms at one time would be unusual anytime of year,” said Brian Barjenbruch, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Valley, Nebraska. “But to have this happen in December is really abnormal.”The governors of Kansas and Iowa declared states of emergency.The system came on the heels of devastating tornadoes last weekend that cut a path through states including Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Illinois and Kentucky, killing more than 85 people.On Wednesday, there were at least 59 reports of hurricane-force wind gusts regionwide, which exceeded the 53 recorded on Aug. 10, 2020, when a rare derecho wind storm struck Iowa, the Storm Prediction Center said. The destruction on Wednesday, however, was far less severe than from last year’s derecho, which caused billions of dollars of damage.The winds also whipped up dust that reduced visibility to zero in parts of Kansas and caused at least four semitrailers to blow over, leading officials to temporarily close much of Interstate 70, as well as all state highways in nine northwestern Kansas counties.Kansas deployed helicopters and other firefighting equipment to help smother at least a dozen wind-fueled wildfires in western and central counties, officials said Thursday.That dust and smoke was carried north by the storm and concentrated over parts of Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa, causing a dramatic drop in air quality in those areas late Wednesday. That spawned a glut of calls to already-taxed emergency dispatchers from people reporting the smell of smoke.The system blew into the Plains from Colorado, sending gale-force winds across a swath from New Mexico to Minnesota, Wisconsin and upper Michigan. The weather service recorded a gust of 107 mph (172 kph) Wednesday morning at Lamar, Colorado, and gusts of 100 mph in Russell, Kansas.Scientists say extreme weather events and warmer temperatures are more likely to occur with human-caused climate change. However, scientifically attributing a storm system to global warming requires specific analysis and computer simulations that take time, haven’t been done and sometimes show no clear connection.“I think we also need to stop asking the question of whether or not this event was caused by climate change,” said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. “We need to be asking, `To what extent did climate change play a role and how likely was this event to occur in the absence of climate change?’”The unusually warm temperatures on Wednesday were due in part to record high ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, which wouldn’t have happened without global warming, said Jeff Masters, a Yale Climate Connections meteorologist who cofounded Weather Underground."}, {"title": "Biden Pledges To Do 'Whatever It Takes' To Help Tornado Victims", "text": "DAWSON SPRINGS, Ky. (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday pledged to do “whatever it takes, as long as it takes” to help Kentucky and other states after a series of deadly tornadoes that he said left a trail of unimaginable devastation. “You will recover and rebuild,” he said.“The scope and scale of this destruction is almost beyond belief,” he said as he stood before a home reduced to a few walls and piles of rubble in Dawson Springs, one of two Kentucky towns he visited.Biden spoke of the stress felt by victims of natural disasters such as the weekend storms that swept across eight states and said it was urgent that people be moved from emergency shelters in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. At the same time, the president praised the outpouring of support from reeling communities and said the federal support he has committed will keep flowing.“Something good has to come out of this,” Biden said. “In so many places, destruction was met with compassion.”More than 30 tornadoes tore through Kentucky and seven other states over the weekend, killing at least 88 people. Thousands of residents have lost their houses or are without power.“I intend to do whatever it takes as long as it takes to support your state, your local leaders, as you recover and rebuild, and you will recover and rebuild,” Biden said.In Dawson Springs, Biden walked through mounds of debris. Shattered Christmas decorations were tangled up with shards of furniture and strewn clothing. Trees were uprooted among homes reduced to rubble. Over the sounds of heavy machinery engaged in cleanup just blocks away, the president stopped to speak with storms victims, including a young girl clutching an American flag.Biden came over to a family sitting before a home without a roof or windows, and also spoke to a group of police officers. He offered hugs to an older couple. And at one point he joked with woman wearing Green Bay Packers apparel that she should tell star NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers that “he’s gotta get the vaccine” — a reference to Rodgers’ stand  against the COVID-19 shot.Earlier, in Mayfield, the president held hands in prayer with Graves County Executive Jesse Perry and a pastor. A family that had gathered in front of a destroyed home talked with Biden, who told reporters he was “impressed how everybody is working together” on the recovery. On Mayfield’s main street, Biden spoke with two women in a shattered building. They had a sign that said, “God is good. Beaten but not defeated.”Biden also took an aerial tour of the damage and held a briefing with officials in an airport hangar. “I’m here to listen,” he said. This kind of tragedy, Biden said, “either brings people together or it knocks them apart.”He added, “There’s no red tornadoes and blue tornadoes.”Despite the president’s push for unity in the face of disaster, his visit to the strongly Republican county, which Donald Trump won by a nearly 4-to-1 margin in 2020 — brought out some detractors. Scattered protesters offered up “Let’s go Brandon” chants, used by some conservatives to represent a more vulgar epithet against the president, as Biden arrived.But Biden’s stop was met with optimism by many residents, who said they hoped the president would help get their communities back on their feet.“I want to see if he’s going to help individuals who have been affected by this,” said Michelle Anderson, 68, who took cover in her bathtub with her cat when the tornado ripped the roof off the second floor of her apartment building in Mayfield. “I hope he does.”While congressional business kept him in Washington during the tour, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell leader has spoken about his appreciation for Biden’s response to the disaster. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she is talking to Kentucky lawmakers about what’ is needed for the state — a nod to a possible disaster relief bill with supplemental funds for recovery.Across the United States, it’s been a year marked by a notable increase in extreme weather occurrences driven primarily by climate change. Only a month after he was sworn into office, Biden went to Houston to survey the damage wrought by a historic storm. He was in Idaho, Colorado and California to survey wildfire damage during the summer. After Hurricane Ida struck, Biden went to Louisiana as well as New Jersey and New York in September.The disasters have offered Biden evidence of what he says is the pressing need for America to do more to combat climate change and prepare for future disasters — a case he made to help push for passage of his spending proposals.The $1 trillion infrastructure bill, signed into law last month, includes billions for climate resilience projects aimed to better defend people and property from future storms, wildfires and other natural disasters. His proposed $2 trillion social spending package, still pending in Congress, includes billions more to help shift the nation away from oil, gas and coal and toward widespread clean energy and electric vehicle use.The White House has spent much of the week engaging with lawmakers on the latter. Biden talked with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic holdout, in hopes of smoothing over some of his issues in time to pass a package before year’s end.Five tornadoes hit Kentucky, including one with an extraordinarily long path of about 200 miles (322 kilometers), authorities said.Besides the deaths in Kentucky, the tornadoes also killed at least six people in Illinois, where the Amazon distribution center in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri.___Associated Press writers Sean Murphy and Bruce Schreiner in Mayfield, Kentucky, contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Zebras On The Run For Months In Maryland Have Been Captured", "text": "UPPER MARLBORO, Md.

There is currently no plan for how the supply would be managed should Lake Mead drop below 1,025 feet (312.42 meters) above sea level. Modeling suggests that could likely happen as soon as 2024 if the 500+ Plan is not adopted.Every foot of elevation lost in Mead reduces Hoover Dam’s hydropower generation by about 6 megawatts — it’s currently running around 75% capacity. If levels ever fall below 950 feet (289.56 meters), the dam’s turbines, which generate power for 1.3 million people in three states, would stop running altogether.For California, which receives more than half the hydropower, the deal is particularly urgent, says Adel Hagekhalil, general manager of Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.“As levels drop at Lake Mead, it’s basically strangling everything,” Hagekhalil said.Ultimately, Mother Nature is in charge, says Kathryn Sorensen, research director at the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University.“It’s all based on modeling that may or may not be correct,” Sorensen said. “Whether even the 500+ plan is enough, I just don’t think people know.”Next year marks 100 years since the Colorado River Compact was signed, apportioning the river’s water among seven states, and later Mexico, during an unseasonably wet era.In the years since then, federally subsidized water projects allowed cities and farms to balloon, and 40 million people now rely at least in part on the Colorado River’s water. As scientists say climate change is making  the West warmer and more arid, far less water is available in the system to meet demands of all users.___Follow Brittany Peterson on Twitter: @brittanykamalei___The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Eight people were confirmed dead and eight remained missing at the factory as of Sunday, but more than 90 others had been located.However, several employees say their supervisors and team leaders told them they could lose their jobs if they left the factory to seek safety, according to NBC News.Elijah Johnson said that when he asked to leave, one of his supervisors told him he’d be fired.“Even with the weather like this, you’re still going to fire me?” the 20-year-old asked.Johnson told NBC News the manager responded, “Yes.”Mayfield Consumer Products spokesperson Bob Furguson told NBC News that the allegations were “absolutely untrue” and that “employees can leave any time they want to leave and they can come back the next day.” But five employees told the network they were either told they couldn’t leave or weren’t verbally told they had the option.In addition, company CEO Troy Propes said workers were told to shelter inside the factory’s bathrooms, which had windowless concrete walls and a steel roof, because management didn’t want to send workers out into the storm, according to Kentucky.com.“Everyone was aware of bad weather. But as we’re all taught, even as children, the first thing you do is, don’t go get in your car,” Propes said. “This is a manufacturing facility. You would never believe that — you would have thought that this would have been one of the more safest places to be. And yet this storm proved differently.”However, after team leaders mistakenly thought the tornado was no longer a danger, they sent everyone back to work.When the tornado hit, forklift operator Mark Saxton told NBC News, the factory tiles and concrete started falling.“Everyone started running, so I just dropped to the ground. I got in a fetal position, and the concrete slab fell on top of me.”Saxton said he was then picked up by the twister and ended up on the building’s collapsed roof. He survived with minor cuts and bruises.But he said he’s still haunted by the way he was treated by higher-ups.“It hurts, ’cause I feel like we were neglected,” Saxton said."}, {"title": "Photo From Tornado-Damaged Home Lands Almost 130 Miles Away", "text": "When Katie Posten walked outside Saturday morning to her car parked in her driveway, she saw something that looked like a note or receipt stuck to the windshield.She grabbed it and saw it was a black and white photo of a woman in a striped sundress and headscarf holding a little boy in her lap. On the back, written in cursive, it said, “Gertie Swatzell & J.D. Swatzell 1942.” A few hours later, Posten would discover that the photo had made quite a journey - almost 130 miles (209 kilometers) on the back of monstrous winds.Posten had been tracking the tornadoes that hit the middle of the U.S. Friday night, killing dozens of people. They came close to where she lives in New Albany, Indiana, across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. So she figured it must be debris from someone’s damaged home.“Seeing the date, I realized that was likely from a home hit by a tornado. How else is it going to be there?” Posten said in a phone interview Sunday morning. “It’s not a receipt. It’s well-kept photo.”So, doing what any 21st century person would do, she posted an image of the photo on Facebook and Twitter and asked for help in finding its owners. She said she was hoping someone on social media would have a connection to the photo or share it with someone who had a connection.Sure enough, that’s what happened.“A lot of people shared it on Facebook. Someone came across it who is friends with a man with the same last name, and they tagged him,” said Posten, 30, who works for a tech company.That man was Cole Swatzell, who commented that the photo belonged to family members in Dawson Springs, Kentucky, almost 130 miles (209 kilometers) away from New Albany, as the crow flies, and 167 miles (269 kilometers) away by car. Swatzell on Sunday didn’t respond to a Facebook message seeking comment.In Dawson Springs — a town of about 2,700 people 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Paducah — homes were leveled, trees were splintered and search and rescue teams continued to scour the community for any survivors. Dozens of people across five states were killed.The fact that the photo traveled almost 130 miles is “unusual but not that unusual,” said John Snow, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma.In one documented case from the 1920s, paper debris traveled 230 miles from the Missouri Bootheel into southern Illinois. The paper debris rides winds, sometimes reaching heights of 30,000 to 40,000 feet above the ground, he said.“It gets swirled up,” Snow said. “The storm dissipates and then everything flutters down to the ground.”Posten wasn’t alone in finding family photos and school pictures that had traveled dozens of miles in the tornadoes’ paths. A Facebook group was set up after the storms so people could post photos and other items like an ultrasound image they had found deposited in their yards.Posten plans to return the photo to the Swatzell family sometime this week.“It’s really remarkable, definitely one of those things, given all that has happened, that makes you consider how valuable things are — memories, family heirlooms, and those kinds of things,” Posten said. “It shows you the power of social media for good.

(AP) — Workers on the night shift at Mayfield Consumer Products were in the middle of the holiday rush, cranking out candles, when a tornado closed in on the factory and the word went out: “Duck and cover.”Autumn Kirks pulled down her safety goggles and took shelter, tossing aside wax and fragrance buckets to make room. She glanced away from her boyfriend, Lannis Ward, and when she looked back, he was gone.Gov. Andy Beshear initially said Saturday that only 40 of the 110 people working in the factory at the time were rescued, and that “it’ll be a miracle if anybody else is found alive in it.” But on Sunday, the candle company said that while eight were confirmed dead and eight remained missing, more than 90 others had been located.Dozens of people in several Kentucky counties are still believed to have died in the storms, but Beshear, after saying Sunday morning the state’s toll could exceed 100, said that afternoon it might be as low as 50.“We are praying that maybe original estimates of those we have lost were wrong. If so, it’s going to be pretty wonderful,” the governor said.Kentucky was the worst-hit state by far in an unusual mid-December swarm of twisters across the Midwest and the South that leveled entire communities and left at least 14 people dead in four other states.At the candle factory, rescuers had to crawl over the dead to get to the living at a disaster scene that smelled like scented candles.But by the time churchgoers gathered Sunday morning to pray for the lost, more than 24 hours had elapsed since anyone had been found alive in the wreckage. Instead, crews recovered pieces of peoples’ lives — a backpack, a pair of shoes and a cellphone with 27 missed messages were among the items.Layers of steel and cars 15 feet deep were on top of what used to the factory roof, the governor said.“We’re going to grieve together, we’re going to dig out and clean up together, and we will rebuild and move forward together. We’re going to get through this,” Beshear said. “We’re going to get through this together, because that is what we do.”Four twisters hit the state in all, including one with an extraordinarily long path of about 200 miles (322 kilometers), authorities said. The outbreak was all the more remarkable because it came at a time of year when cold weather normally limits tornadoes.Warren County coroner Kevin Kirby said the death toll from the storms in an around Bowling Green grew by one on Sunday to 12.“I’ve got towns that are gone, that are just, I mean gone. My dad’s hometown — half of it isn’t standing,” Beshear said of Dawson Springs.He said that going door to door in search of victims is out of the question in the hardest-hit areas: “There are no doors.”“We’re going to have over 1,000 homes that are gone, just gone,” the governor said.With afternoon high temperatures forecast only in the 40s, tens of thousands of people were without power. About 300 National Guard members went house to house, checking on people and helping to remove debris. Cadaver dogs searched for victims.Kirks said she and her boyfriend were about 10 feet apart in a hallway when someone said to take cover. Suddenly, she saw sky and lightning where a wall had been, and Ward had vanished.“I remember taking my eyes off of him for a second, and then he was gone,” she said.Later, she got the terrible news — that Ward had been killed in the storm.“It was indescribable,” Pastor Joel Cauley said of the disaster scene. “It was almost like you were in a twilight zone. You could smell the aroma of candles, and you could hear the cries of people for help. Candle smells and all the sirens is not something I ever expected to experience at the same time.”The outbreak also killed at least six people in Illinois, where an Amazon distribution center in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri.Debris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted sheet metal, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows were blown out and roofs torn off the buildings that were still standing.In the shadows of their crumpled church sanctuaries, two congregations in Mayfield came together on Sunday to pray for those who were lost. Members of First Christian Church and First Presbyterian Church met in a parking lot surrounded by rubble, piles of broken bricks and metal.“Our little town will never be the same, but we’re resilient,” Laura McClendon said. “We’ll get there, but it’s going to take a long time.”___Associated Press writers Kristin Hall and Claire Galofaro in Mayfield; Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Alabama; Seth Borenstein in Washington; and Travis Loller in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report."}, {"title": "FEMA Chief: Magnitude Of Recent Tornadoes ‘New Normal’ Due To Climate Crisis", "text": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s administrator said Sunday that the swarm of deadly tornadoes that hit the Midwest and the South this weekend will be the “new normal” in the era of a worsening climate crisis.On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Deanne Criswell told Jake Tapper that her agency sent a federal urban search-and-rescue team to Kentucky, one of six states hit by the twisters that landed on a mid-December night with springtime temperatures. The team will help localities with ongoing rescue efforts ― as officials already count dozens dead ― while FEMA will work with states and the American Red Cross to support short-term shelter and long-term housing needs.“You know, I think it’s incredibly unusual. We do see tornadoes in December, that part is not unusual. But at this magnitude, I don’t think we have ever seen one this late in the year,” she said. “But it’s also historic. Even the severity and the amount of time this tornado or these tornadoes spent on the ground is unprecedented.”Tornadoes usually last only a few minutes when thunderstorm updrafts lose energy. But once Friday night’s storms formed, experts said unprecedented strong wind shear appeared to have prevented the twisters from dissipating ― resulting in a disaster that lasted hours and traveled more than 200 miles at over 50 miles per hour.Scientists are still trying to figure out many complicated factors about whether human-caused climate change is resulting in more common and intense tornadoes, The Associated Press reported. An average of 1,200 tornadoes hit the U.S. yearly ― a number no other country has experienced ― according to the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.Less than 10% of severe thunderstorms produce tornadoes, which makes it tricky for scientists to conclude climate change’s level of influence on the twisters, tornado scientist Harold Brooks told the AP. Brooks said the U.S. will likely see more tornadoes occur in the cool season as warm weather in the winter becomes more common as the planet warms.“This is going to be our new normal. And the effects that we’re seeing from climate change are the crisis of our generation,” Criswell said. “We’re taking a lot of efforts at FEMA to work with communities to help reduce the impacts that we’re seeing from these severe weather events and help to develop systemwide projects that can help protect communities.”“And so we will continue to work on helping reduce the impacts,” Criswell continued, “but we’re also prepared to respond to any community that gets impacted by one of these severe events.”Jason Furtado, a professor with the University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology, told the AP that tornado alley ― which describes the region where many twisters hit ― is moving eastward from its original Kansas-Oklahoma area, into the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio River Valley, where Friday’s tornadoes took place. He said the shift is due to the increases in temperature, moisture and wind shear.Kentucky was the worst-hit state by far in the swarm of twisters that leveled entire communities and left a steadily increasing number of people dead. Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN on Sunday that the disaster was “the deadliest tornado event we’ve ever had,” confirming more than 80 Kentuckians dead and estimating the number will exceed 100.“I’ve got towns that are gone, that just, I mean gone. My dad’s hometown ― half of it isn’t standing,” he said, saying the list of people unaccounted for in that town of 2,700, Dawson Springs, “was about eight pages single-spaced.”“It is hard for me to describe. I know people can see the visuals, but that goes on for 12 blocks or more in some of these places. And it’s going to take us time. I mean, you think you go door-to-door to check on people and see if they’re OK,” he continued. “There are no doors. The question is, is somebody in the rubble of thousands upon thousands of structures? I mean, it is devastating.”"}, {"title": "Explainer: Was Deadly Tornado Storm System Related To Climate Change?", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The calendar said December but the warm moist air screamed of springtime. Add an eastbound storm front guided by a La Nina weather pattern into that mismatch and it spawned tornadoes that killed dozens over five U.S. states.Tornadoes in December are unusual, but not unheard of. But the ferocity and path length of Friday night’s tornadoes likely put them in a category of their own, meteorologists say. One of the twisters — if it is confirmed to have been just one — likely broke a nearly 100-year-old record for how long a tornado stayed on the ground in a path of destruction, experts said.“One word: remarkable; unbelievable would be another,” said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini. “It was really a late spring type of setup in in the middle of December.”Warm weather was a crucial ingredient in this tornado outbreak, but whether climate change is a factor is not quite as clear, meteorologists say.Scientists say figuring out how climate change is affecting the frequency of tornadoes is complicated and their understanding is still evolving. But they do say the atmospheric conditions that give rise to such outbreaks are intensifying in the winter as the planet warms. And tornado alley is shifting farther east away from the Kansas-Oklahoma area and into states where Friday’s killers hit.Here’s a look at what’s known about Friday’s tornado outbreak and the role of climate change in such weather events.WHAT CAUSES A TORNADO?Tornadoes are whirling, vertical air columns that form from thunderstorms and stretch to the ground. They travel with ferocious speed and lay waste to everything in their path.Thunderstorms occur when denser, drier cold air is pushed over warmer, humid air, conditions scientists call atmospheric instability. As that happens, an updraft is created when the warm air rises. When winds vary in speed or direction at different altitudes — a condition known as wind shear — the updraft will start to spin.These changes in winds produce the spin necessary for a tornado. For especially strong tornadoes, changes are needed in both the wind’s speed and direction.“When considerable variation in wind is found over the lowest few thousand feet of the atmosphere, tornado-producing ‘supercell thunderstorms’ are possible,” said Paul Markowski, professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University. “That’s what we had yesterday.”There’s usually a lot of wind shear in the winter because of the big difference in temperature and air pressure between the equator and the Arctic, Gensini said.But usually, there’s not a lot of instability in the winter that’s needed for tornadoes because the air isn’t as warm and humid, Gensini said. This time there was.WHAT CONDITIONS LED TO STORMS OF THIS SCALE?A few factors, which meteorologists will continue to study.Spring-like temperatures across much of the Midwest and South in December helped bring the warm, moist air that helped form thunderstorms. Some of this is due to La Nina, which generally brings warmer than normal winter temperatures to the Southern U.S. But scientists also expect atypical, warm weather in the winter to become more common as the planet warms.“The worst-case scenario happened. Warm air in the cold season, middle of the night,” said John Gordon, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Louisville, Kentucky.Once the storm formed, exceptionally strong wind shear appears to have prevented the tornadoes from dissipating, experts say. Tornadoes are thought to die off when thunderstorm updrafts lose energy.Tornadoes typically lose energy in a matter of minutes, but in this case it was hours, Gensini said. That’s partly the reason for the exceptionally long path of Friday’s storm, going more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) or so, he said. The record was 219 miles (352 kilometers) and was set by a tornado that struck four states in 1925. Gensini thinks this one will surpass it once meteorologists finish analyzing it.“In order to get a really long path length, you have to have a really fast moving storm. This storm was moving well over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour for a majority of its life,” Gensini said. That’s not the speed of the winds, but of the overall storm movement.“You’re talking about highway-speed storm motions,” Gensini said.HOW RELATED IS CLIMATE CHANGE TO TORNADO OUTBREAKS?It’s complicated. Scientists are still trying to sort out the many conflicting factors about whether human-caused climate change is making tornadoes more common — or even more intense. About 1,200 twisters hit the U.S. each year — though that figure can vary — according to the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. No other country sees as many.Attributing a specific storm like Friday’s to the effects of climate change remains very challenging. Less than 10% of severe thunderstorms produce tornadoes, which makes drawing conclusions about climate change and the processes leading up to them tricky, said Harold Brooks, a tornado scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory.Scientists have observed changes taking place to the basic ingredients of a thunderstorm, however, as the planet warms. Gensini says in the aggregate, extreme storms are “becoming more common because we have a lot warmer air masses in the cool season that can support these types of severe weather outbreaks.”The U.S. is likely to see more tornadoes occur in the winter, Brooks said, as national temperatures rise above the long-term average. Fewer events will take place in the summer, he said.Furtado of the University of Oklahoma said tornado alley, a term used to describe where many twisters hit the U.S., has shifted eastward into the Mississippi River Valley. That shift is because of increases in temperature, moisture and shear.“Bottom line: The people in the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio River Valley are becoming increasingly vulnerable to more tornadic activity with time,” he said.___Follow Suman Naishadham on Twitter @sumannaishadham and Seth Borenstein at @borenbears___The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Rescuers were able to get some, but not all, of the rope off of her before she left the bay.More attempts were made to free her in May and June, but Snow Cone resisted their efforts and was “evasive and strong,” Mackie Greene of the New Brunswick-based Campobello Whale Rescue team told CBC News.No one knew at the time that Snow Cone was pregnant. But earlier this month, scientists spotted Snow Cone ― still dragging thick, heavy rope from her mouth ― with a newborn calf off the coast of Georgia.NOAA scientists were both “surprised and concerned” that Snow Cone had managed to give birth while entangled, the agency’s statement said.The calf is healthy, uninjured and not caught in the rope, but scientists fear the baby could get entangled, too.“My concern is [Snow Cone’s] still got two pieces of rope, about 20 feet, coming out from the left side of her mouth,” Clay George, a biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources biologist told the Associated Press. “If those two pieces of rope ended up getting knotted around each other and there’s a loop, you could imagine that calf could end up becoming entangled.”Even if that doesn’t happen, the stress of the situation still poses a major threat to both the calf and Snow Cone’s health.“Entanglement alone is a costly energetic drain and so is nursing a calf,” Barb Zoodsma, a large whale recovery coordinator at NOAA, said in the release. “The severity of her mouth and head injuries are also disconcerting. For these reasons, Snow Cone may be facing her biggest challenge yet in the upcoming months.”She noted, however that Snow Cone’s perseverance ― her previous calf was killed in a boat collision last year ― shows that the mother whale “clearly” has “game.”In the meantime, scientists say that, while her newborn is close by, it’s too risky to get close to Snow Cone to try again to disentangle her.North Atlantic right whales are critically endangered, and both fishing gear entanglements and collisions with ships are major threats to the species. According to NOAA, there are fewer than 350 of the whales left, and they’re currently dying out faster than they can reproduce."}, {"title": "Survivors Recount Horror Of Destructive Storm System That Hit Several States", "text": "Survivors of an enormous storm system say they’ve never seen anything like the storms that tore through several states late Friday and early Saturday, spawning tornadoes that sounded like freight trains and extreme winds that destroyed homes and buildings including an Amazon warehouse and an elder care facility.More than 70 people are feared dead, with rescue workers still sifting through the wreckage Saturday afternoon.The storm system traveled east from Arkansas into parts of Missouri, Mississippi and Illinois before it barreled through Tennessee and Kentucky, where a candle factory was among the structures that were wiped out.“Everything happened so fast,” Kyanna Parsons-Perez, a candle factory employee, said on the “Today” show on Saturday morning.The factory was hit by a tornado and collapsed onto an estimated 110 people who were inside at the time, according to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D). So far, about 40 people have been rescued, but Beshear believes “at least dozens” are dead inside the factory.“This will be, I believe, the deadliest tornado system to ever run through Kentucky,” the governor said. One tornado is believed to have ripped through 200 miles of land, flattening entire neighborhoods.Parsons-Perez told CNN that it “breaks her heart” to hear how many people did not make it out of the factory. The workers had gathered in a storm shelter in the building, she said, when the lights began flickering and she felt a gale coming.“All of the sudden we could feel the wind, and then my ears kind of start popping, as if they would if you’re on a plane. And then we did like a little rock ― this way, and this way ― and then, boom, everything came down on us,” she recalled on “Today.” Parsons-Perez said she heard screams and prayers in Spanish and English.She started streaming live on Facebook while she was pinned beneath about 5 feet of rubble in order to draw attention to the factory workers’ predicament after a 911 responder told her many people needed assistance.“It was absolutely the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced in my life,” she said, adding that those who were trapped had help from an unlikely source: prisoners who were working in the factory at the time.“When I tell you those prisoners were working their tails off to get us out ― they were helping,” she said. “Because, you know, they could’ve used that moment to try to run away or anything. They did not. They were there, they were helping us.”A woman in Bowling Green, Kentucky, said the winds pulled her out of her house just as she was corralling the last of her family members into the basement.“We ran downstairs because we heard the siren, and then I heard something that sounded like a train,” the woman told WHAS, a local ABC affiliate.

Photos of their homes showed crumbling brick walls and piles of splintered wood and scattered appliances.Rescue workers were still digging people out of the Amazon warehouse collapse in Edwardsville, Illinois, on Saturday. Edwardsville Police Chief Michael Fillback told a St. Louis news station that around 50 people had likely been in the warehouse when it was destroyed.Authorities say people were killed, but a precise number is not yet known.A local CBS affiliate, KMOV, spoke to Aisha White, who said she was on the phone on Friday night with a family member who worked at the warehouse.“He was on the phone with me while it was happening,” White told the outlet. “The tornado was hitting the back of the building, the trucks were coming in, I told him to jump out the truck and duck.” White could not immediately find her family member when she arrived on the scene.An Edwardsville resident who gave his name as Jack Bench described waiting out the storm in his basement as the storm passed overhead.“It sounded like a train went through here. It lasted about three minutes and then it got quiet,” he told FOX2 reporter John Pertzborn."}, {"title": "Man Thought Death Was Near As Otter Pack Overpowered Him In Singapore Park", "text": "An early morning stroll in the Singapore Botanic Gardens turned surreal and nightmarish for one man last month when he was attacked by a pack of smooth-coated otters in an incident that left him with 26 wounds and needing stitches.“I actually thought I was going to die — they were going to kill me,” Graham George Spencer, a British man in his 60s who lives in Singapore, told The Straits Times.In the wake of the Nov. 30, incident, local otter enthusiasts have stressed that otter attacks are rare and typically only occur when the animals feel threatened.In this case, Spencer told Reuters that a jogger had run past him and stepped on one of the otters. The animals sprang into action, but when the jogger moved on, past Spencer, the otters seemed to think he was the man who had stepped on one of their pack.“These otters got attacked, if you will, by being stepped on — and in a moment of confusion they attacked the wrong guy,” Bernard Seah, a photographer who tracks and documents the otters, told the BBC.The case of mistaken identity made it no less harrowing for Spencer, though. He fell to the ground as the otters overtook him and bit him repeatedly for 10 to 12 seconds before his friend was able to rescue him by yelling at the otters and pulling Spencer to safety.The otters involved are a group known as the Zouk family, which currently is made up of nine adults and six pups. The Zouks are a frequent sight at the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Seah told The Straits Times that they are very “human-tolerant” and he had never heard of them behaving aggressively like this before.Dr. Tan Puay Yok, group director of the botanic gardens, said that any park visitors should give wildlife ample space, especially when there are young involved.The Zouks, which get their name from a local nightclub, made headlines in 2020 when COVID-19 lockdowns and the lack of people out in public emboldened them to do things like take a dip in a condo pool and frolic in a children’s hospital lobby.Some Singaporeans derided the otters after they snacked on expensive ornamental fish in a private pond. But as the Los Angeles Times noted, the incident just made some of their fans love them more, as people empathized more with the otters than the ultra-wealthy who have fancy fish ponds."}, {"title": "Mountain Lion Kittens Rescued After Being Found Under Picnic Table", "text": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.

At its root, our climate anxiety comes from this deep-set feeling of betrayal because of government inaction. To truly address our growing climate anxiety, we need justice.”The United Nations’ latest climate report repeated what similar reports have been saying for years, with even greater certainty: Humans are the “unequivocal” cause of climate change, and the window to avoid catastrophic living conditions worldwide due to global warming is rapidly closing.The communities most vulnerable to climate change — including those experiencing slower recoveries in the aftermath of climate disasters — are disproportionately poor, Black and Latinx.This year alone, we’ve seen the hottest July ever recorded on the planet (again), the largest single wildfire in California history (again) and deadly Hurricane Ida in the U.S. causing devastating flooding from the Gulf Coast through the Northeast (again).“Our children’s anxiety is a completely rational reaction given the inadequate responses to climate change they are seeing from governments,” study co-author Caroline Hickman of the University of Bath said in a release. “What more do governments need to hear to take action?”"}, {"title": "Should We Electrocute The Oceans To Curb Climate Change? That’s One Idea.", "text": "Some of the nation’s leading ocean and climate scientists are calling on the U.S. government to invest up to $1.3 billion in research on human interventions that could boost the oceans’ ability to suck up planet-warming carbon dioxide in the coming decades.The recommendation is part of a new, 300-page National Academy of Sciences report released Wednesday that explores six techniques for accelerating ocean CO2 removal and storage, some more radical than others. Potential areas of study include restoring degraded ecosystems, large-scale seaweed farming, dumping nutrients like iron and phosphorus in the water to promote plankton growth, and even jolting seawater with electricity to make it less acidic.The report outlines known risks and benefits, as well as costs and scalability, in order to provide policymakers with a framework for deciding next steps. It does not advocate for any individual tool or technology.“All of these approaches have some combination of tradeoffs and there are substantial knowledge gaps,” Scott Doney, an oceanographer at the University of Virginia and chair of the NAS committee that authored the report, told HuffPost. “It’s really trying to find investments on the research side that could fill those gaps in a way that would better prepare us to make those decisions.”Burning of fossil fuels and other human activities have driven atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to their highest point in 800,000 years, and there is a growing consensus among the world’s leading scientists that staving off potentially catastrophic climate change will require more than simply cutting greenhouse gas emissions going forward. A 2019 NAS report, for example, found that the world will have to find ways to remove approximately 10 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere each year by mid-century to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the goal of the landmark Paris climate agreement.If it weren’t for the oceans, Earth’s largest carbon sink, the planet would already be significantly warmer. Oceans have absorbed an estimated 93% of the excess heat from human-caused climate change, and climate scientists and advocates have increasingly pushed for countries to use them as a key tool to meet climate goals and achieve the 1.5 degree target.“The ocean holds great potential for uptake and longer-term sequestration of human-produced CO2,” the NAS report states.Of the six possible techniques, NAS’s initial assessment concluded that nutrient fertilization and introducing electrical currents were among the most likely to prove effective at enhancing CO2 storage. But both come with significant environmental risk.“We want to do it in a thoughtful way that avoids environmental damages, that avoids negative social or ecological impacts,” Doney said. “But there’s an urgency to start reducing emissions relatively soon.”“I don’t want to be 5 or 10 years from now and not have done some of this foundational research that we’ve recommended on the social dimensions, governance and carbon accounting,” he added.The NAS panel recommended an initial $125 million to fund a U.S. program to study the challenges and potential impacts of ocean carbon removal, with additional funding up to $1.2 billion over the next 10 years to conduct in-depth research into each of the six techniques.Jan Mazurek, senior director of ClimateWorks Foundation, which sponsored the study, called it a “scientific road map for how healthy oceans can cool the climate.”“The ocean is the heart of our planet, but the world’s fossil fuel addiction has pumped it full of CO2 and turned it more acidic, giving sea life the equivalent of heartburn disease,” she said in a statement. “We cannot live healthily if our oceans are sick.”"}, {"title": "Camel Beauty Contest Rocked By Botox Scandal", "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi authorities have conducted their biggest-ever crackdown on camel beauty contestants that received Botox injections and other artificial touch-ups, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Wednesday, with over 40 camels disqualified from the annual pageant.Saudi Arabia’s popular King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, which kicked off earlier this month, invites the breeders of the most beautiful camels to compete for some $66 million in prize money.

(AP) — Normally giving food to wild animals is considered off limits, but the dire situation in Florida with more than 1,000 manatees dying from starvation due to manmade pollution is leading officials to consider an unprecedented feeding plan.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state environmental officials intend to unveil a limited proposal this week to feed the beloved marine mammals in one specific Florida location to test how it works. This is not usually done with any wild animal, but the situation has become such an emergency that it has to be considered, said Save The Manatee Club Executive Director Patrick Rose.The club was co-founded in 1981 by Florida troubadour Jimmy Buffet and former governor and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham.“It’s the entire ecosystem that is affected by this and will be affected for a decade to come,” Rose said in an interview Tuesday. “This is a necessary stopgap measure. It is a problem created by man and man is going to have to solve it.”A Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman said in an email that the agency “does have approval to move forward on a limited feeding trial” but that details are not yet finalized. A formal announcement is expected later this week.The emerging plan would involve feeding manatees at a Florida Power & Light plant in Cape Canaveral, along the Indian River Lagoon on the east coast where manatees congregate in cold winter months because of the warm water discharge from the plant. It would be an experiment involving lettuce, cabbage, and other greens delivered in a controlled manner such as via a conveyer belt, Rose said.People would not be authorized to simply start tossing lettuce into a Florida bay some place.“Under no circumstances do we want people feeding manatees. It’s illegal, and remains so,” Rose said.Manatees have long struggled to survive with humans. Hundreds of the slow-moving animals are struck every year by boats, which has led to no-wake manatee zones throughout Florida with violations punishable by significant fines. But the starvation threat has led to a record 1,017 manatee deaths as of Nov. 19, according to state figures.As winter looms, even in Florida, another bad year is expected.This has been caused mainly by runoff from farms, urban areas and sewage that promotes growth of blue-green algae and other harmful organisms. It chokes off light needed by seagrass, eliminating the main food source for manatees. Climate change that worsens the algae blooms is also a factor.And it’s not just manatees. People’s health can be affected by the algae blooms along with the health of a wide range of aquatic creatures, from crabs to dolphins. Aside from protecting the animals, there is an economic loss for boat captains, sightseeing tours and others who flock to Florida for the chance to see these creatures.“Literally, saving manatees is part of saving the ecosystem. If we can get this taken care of, manatees will flourish. If we don’t, they won’t,” Rose said. “We are in the most critical position.”Manatees were listed as endangered for years by the federal government, but in 2017 their numbers appeared to have rebounded enough — officials say there are between 7,000 and 8,000 animals in Florida — that their status was downgraded to threatened. Several Florida politicians, including Republican U.S, Rep. Vern Buchanan, have been pushing to restore the endangered status which brings more attention and resources to them."}, {"title": "Navy Suspends Military Tank Farm After Hawaii Aquifer Contamination", "text": "Navy Suspends Military Tank Farm After Hawaii Aquifer ContaminationHONOLULU (AP) — The U.S. Navy announced Monday that it has suspended use of World War II-era fuel tank farm above a Hawaii aquifer that supplies nearly 20% of Honolulu’s drinking water.Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro made the announcement during a briefing with reporters at Pearl Harbor after problems surfaced about two weeks ago on and near the base.Nearly 1,000 military households have complained that their tap water smells like fuel and some have also complained that they have suffered physical ailments such as cramps and vomiting.A water sample returned last week showed the presence of petroleum. The well is near the underground fuel tank complex that has been the source of multiple fuel leaks over the years.Fuel from the tanks is used to power many U.S. military ships and planes that patrol the Pacific Ocean.The announcement came after Hawaii’s governor and congressional delegation called on the Navy to suspend operations at the tank farm fuel tank farm that sits above an aquifer that supplies water to urban Honolulu.Rear Admiral Blake Converse, deputy commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said that the use of the tank farm was suspended on Nov. 27 but officials did not say why the Navy waited until Monday to make that announcement.The Navy last week said a water sample from one of its wells showed the presence of petroleum. The well is near the underground fuel tank complex that has been the source of multiple fuel leaks over the years.The Navy’s water system serves about 93,000 people. Nearly 1,000 military households complained about their tap water smelling like fuel or of ailments like stomach cramps and vomiting.The Navy said it would flush clean water through the distribution system to clear residual petroleum products from the water. The process, along with testing, could take up to 10 days to make sure the water meets Environmental Protection Agency drinking standards.The Navy also pledged to investigate how contaminates got into the well and to fix the problem.The tap water problems have afflicted one of the military’s most important bases, home to submarines, ships and the commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region. They also threaten to jeopardize one of Honolulu’s most important aquifers and water sources.During World War II, the Roosevelt administration was concerned about the vulnerability of above-the-ground fuel tanks to attacks — so the Navy built the tank farm named the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.The facility has 20 steel-lined underground tanks, which can collectively store up to 250 million gallons (946 million liters) of fuel. The tanks are encased in concrete and stored inside cavities of a volcanic mountain ridge near Honolulu. Pipelines from the tanks run 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) inside a tunnel to fueling piers at Pearl Harbor.The fuel in the tanks is used by the U.S. Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy, Coast Guard and Hawaii National Guard for ships and aircraft. The Navy has said Red Hill is vital to maritime security, regional stability, humanitarian assistance and continued prosperity in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.The Department of Defense has spent more than $200 million on updating the facility and conducting environmental testing since 2006, according to the Navy."}, {"title": "Major Storm Prompts Warnings Of ‘Catastrophic’ Flooding In Hawaii", "text": "A seasonal cyclone is drenching parts of Hawaii with more than a foot of rain, prompting safety officials to warn of dire levels of flooding, potential landslides and power outages beginning Monday and lasting into the middle of the week.The storm is called a Kona low, a slow-moving weather pattern that can sit over parts of the islands that don’t typically get heavy rainfall.

That record, 235 consecutive days, was set in 1887.Not only has it not snowed, it’s been downright hot, with highs in the 70s, which for November and December represents temperatures 20 to 30 degrees above normal. Similar patterns are playing out this week across the central and western U.S.The causes for the aberrant weather in Colorado, at least, are likely threefold, says local 9News meteorologist Chris Bianchi.Colder than average sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific have set up what’s known as a La Niña system that’s contributing to drier and warmer conditions across the state. Dumb luck has probably played a role. And climate change is undoubtedly a factor as well.According to Bianchi, June 1 through Nov. 30 has been the warmest and by far the driest six-month stretch for the city on record.Thanks to a freakishly rainy spring ― the wettest in 80 years ― eastern Colorado’s yearly precipitation totals aren’t too far off historical averages.But there’s nevertheless plenty of reason for concern. Colorado’s snowpack is running 35% to 85% of average and more than half the state is in severe drought, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System, reflecting conditions across most of the western United States.Until “stringent” action is taken to mitigate human-caused climate change, the situation will worsen, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report this September advised.Persistent drought across the west and southwest led to the first-ever Colorado River water shortage declaration this summer, with low water levels causing cascading problems downstream.“We are seeing the effects of climate change in the Colorado River Basin through extended drought, extreme temperatures, expansive wildfires, and in some places flooding and landslides,” Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Tanya Trujillo told reporters in August, after federal officials declared a shortage in Lake Mead, “and now is the time to take action to respond to them.”"}, {"title": "On Lead, Michigan's Drinking Water Might Look Safer Than It Really Is", "text": "This story is co-published with Planet Detroit.New lead rules Michigan instated in 2018 following the Flint water crisis were heralded as the nation’s strictest, but lax enforcement and flaws in testing protocols are making the state’s drinking water appear safer than it likely is, a Planet Detroit and HuffPost analysis of state records finds.Public health advocates say some of the most at-risk water systems are not following a key provision that requires systems that exceed lead limits to check water from lead pipes in follow-up testing.The systems are instead checking water from pipes made of a different or unknown material. That makes their lead levels look lower than they may actually be, and allows officials to legally claim that the water is safe to drink.“It’s giving residents a false sense of confidence in their water quality,” said Elin Betanzo, a former Environmental Protection Agency scientist who now runs the Michigan-based clean water advocacy group Safe Water Engineering.Moreover, public health advocates say the state’s newly implemented Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems to check too few pipes, and annual testing is too infrequent, to give a realistic picture of lead hazards ― releases are unpredictable, and dangerous amounts of particles can leach at any time.State records also show that some municipalities still don’t know what materials 90% of their service lines are made of. And because 10% of a system’s results must exceed limits before follow-up testing is triggered, some pipes releasing lead levels that are considered dangerous to human health have resulted in little action.The problems have created a “disconnect between what we measure, what conclusions we draw and the messaging we deliver,” said Yanna Lambrinidou, a Virginia Tech professor and activist for the Campaign for Lead Free Water.“At the end of the day, people want to know that their water is safe to drink and cook with ... but even if we found an ideal formula or used statistically significant sampling, we still couldn’t really tell any individual home what’s happening in the taps that they’re using,” she added.The new rules also increased testing from every three years to annually, required more robust follow-up testing when a water system exceeds limits, and in 2025 will lower the action level from 15 parts per billion to 12.Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy is responsible for enforcing the rules. Its spokesperson, Hugh McDiarmid, confirmed that some systems with lead levels that exceeded the state’s threshold for action were not specifically checking water from lead lines during follow-up testing ― but he said they were given a pass because many systems were built so long ago that there’s no record of which pipes are made of lead anyway.EPA’s guidance on the federal Lead and Copper Rule, however, says that systems should look for more lead pipes in such scenarios, and states must follow the agency’s rules when they don’t have their own. Michigan has given water systems until 2025 to take a full inventory of their pipes’ material.McDiarmid also said EGLE lacks the resources to fully monitor the lead testing that local water utilities are conducting.“EGLE isn’t staffed to thoroughly review all the individual sample sites from every system to ascertain that each is indeed from known lead service lines,” he said.In response to public health advocates’ concerns about methodology, McDiarmid said EGLE “enforces the requirement of the state Lead & Copper rule, so we’re working within the regulatory framework we are given.”Betanzo said officials at all levels of government likely allow water systems to skirt the rules for two reasons: Lead contamination is a public relations headache, and actually solving the issue is expensive.This increases the urgency of ensuring water customers can use filters, Lambrinidou said. Even if the state’s lead lines are replaced by 2041 as the new rules require, plumbing fixtures in homes can contain lead, and places that never installed lead service lines still find levels in their water that violate federal rules.“We need to give up on testing to determine if taps are safe and we must assume every tap is a lead risk, and that’s scientifically reasonable because we have lead bearing pipes everywhere,” she said.In 2019, Dearborn Heights exceeded the state’s lead action level when water from about 17% of 30 sites the city tested were over the lead limit. That triggered follow-up testing of 62 sites, and the city found 13% of them were above the limit.But during more follow-up testing in late 2020, the numbers began to improve ― only four sites exceeded the limit. By early 2021, only two sites, or 3% of the total, were over the limit, and many showed no lead at all. Dearborn Heights and the state deemed the city’s water safe to drink.This wasn’t due to an environmental miracle, though. The numbers dropped because Dearborn Heights stopped testing water from pipes it knew were made of lead. Data obtained via the Freedom of Information Act indicate that all or most of the pipes checked during the first two rounds were made of lead. In the final two rounds, just 13 and zero were, respectively.“Magic ― there’s no more lead action level exceedance,” Betanzo said.The actual scope of lead contamination in Dearborn Heights, a largely middle-class suburb of Detroit, remains unclear.Dearborn Heights tested its water in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Only on its fourth round of testing, after it tested no sites using testing protocol designed to capture water from service lines, was it able to achieve compliance. Data provided by EGLE via FOIA request.And though EGLE’s rules mandate that water systems conduct follow-up testing at sites that are “served by a lead service line,” Dearborn Heights isn’t alone. Of 33 water systems that have lead pipes and recorded elevated lead levels in 2019 and 2020, at least 17 included water samples from lines made of non-lead or unknown material in follow-up testing at some or all sites. Those include Royal Oak Township, Clare, St. Clair Shores, Harper Woods and Garden City.McDiarmid noted that Dearborn Heights and Royal Oak Township only have a very small number of confirmed lead pipes to check, and said the rules allow water systems that “cannot access enough known” lead lines to test water from non-lead pipes, or lines made of unknown material.But EGLE’s rules don’t say anything about “access.” They state that systems can check non-lead lines if there are “insufficient” lead pipes. Dearborn Heights and Royal Oak Township’s water quality reports show that they have about 2,000 and 700 service lines, respectively, made of an unknown material.Royal Oak Township, which only has nine confirmed lead pipes, just received a county grant and forgivable loan from EGLE worth $3.4 million to fund about 600 lead line replacements over the next two years. Meanwhile, Dearborn Heights’ preliminary inventory of its water system indicates a high probability of more lead pipes.Betanzo charged that the problem isn’t “insufficient” lead lines ― the state simply isn’t requiring water systems to look for them even though those in question have exceeded lead limits and are among the most at risk. It’s also possible that in some cases water systems are only checking the first liter of water instead of the first and fifth liters, as EGLE rules mandate, which is a change implemented to catch water that had been sitting in service lines farther away from the tap. Testing only the first liter would also reduce the likelihood of finding lead.“It looks like EGLE is letting water systems do whatever they want if they haven’t confirmed a lead service line,” Betanzo said.Dearborn Heights water officials didn’t return calls from Planet Detroit.Around 311,000 service lines deliver water in Detroit, and since the new law went into effect, the city has declared that it is in compliance with state law and safe from lead contamination.But city records show that around 80,000 Detroit pipes contain lead, and another nearly 30,000 are made of an unknown material. Under the state’s Lead and Copper Rule, the city only checks 50 pipes in the entire system annually, and public health advocates say that’s too few to provide a meaningful picture of lead levels across Detroit’s 146 square miles.And while testing annually instead of every three years is an improvement, public health advocates say it’s not enough because it’s impossible to know when lead will leach into water. The age of the pipes, the state of corrosion controls, the water use patterns within systems and homes, and vibrations caused by traffic or construction all factor into lead releases.In a city like Detroit with a high number of lead pipes, the state’s methodology “isn’t going to capture what’s really happening in the water system,” said Susan Little, a health advocate with the Environmental Working Group, a national clean water advocacy group.“The sampling is woefully underdone ― it’s minuscule compared to what the real need is,” she said. “Especially since lead is not predictable. It can pop up anywhere.”That’s supported by academic studies that have found that single annual tests “falsely indicate that a water is safe,” and hundreds of tests under a variety of water flow conditions are needed before an accurate picture of lead contamination levels can take shape.Moreover, the law doesn’t trigger a community-wide response until at least 10% of a sample is above the lead action level. Public health advocates say the threshold is too high, and a flaw in that approach is highlighted by a 2020 Pontiac test that found a dangerous count of 2,900 ppb that didn’t trigger follow-up testing.“That creates a Russian roulette situation,” Little said.The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department didn’t answer questions in an email from Planet Detroit, but said residents can request that the agency check their homes for lead pipes for no cost.McDiarmid said the sample pool isn’t designed to be statistically significant, but “is intentionally focused on the sites with the greatest potential for a lead problem.” Referencing the 2,900 ppb measurement found in Pontiac, he noted that the homeowner was notified, and said the state sometimes identifies issues that cause such spikes.“Sometimes the home was unoccupied for an extended period of time, other times the location is found to have very low water usage,” he said. “Irrespective of reason, this variability in data at some locations is why flushing before using water for the first time in a while is so important.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misstated some of the data found in the course of testing Dearborn Heights’ water. The wording of a quote from McDiarmid has also been corrected."}, {"title": "Watch Newborn Giraffe's 'Miracle' Last Stand After Attack By Lion", "text": "A newborn giraffe left for dead by a lion that bit its neck and repeatedly dragged it rose up again, and you can see it in a video posted by Latest Sightings.“This is a miracle,” one observer can be heard saying in the video below as the calf stands in Kenya’s Masai Mara.In the footage, shot by Don Heyneke and Rustom Framjee, a lion began stalking the mother and baby for several miles, according to Latest Sightings.

Yet in the lead-up to this month’s United Nations climate summit, newly elected Prime Minister Fumio Kishida vowed to restart the reactors the country shut down after a tsunami flooded the Fukushima-Daiichi plant in 2011 and caused a meltdown that contaminated more than 300 square miles with hazardous levels of radiation.Japan was hardly alone in rediscovering its enthusiasm for nuclear power. As negotiations to phase out coal fizzled, the United Kingdom announced an investment in Rolls-Royce’s next-generation nuclear reactors. Ghana and Indonesia unveiled plans for their first reactors. And China, the world’s No. 1 carbon emitter, promised to construct an unprecedented 150 new reactors in the next 15 years ― more than the entire world built in the last 35.In the United States, where nuclear power plants have been steadily shutting down for the past decade as they struggle to compete with natural gas and renewable energy sources, the Biden administration pledged to shore up existing reactors and invest in new ones. The $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill President Joe Biden signed into law Nov. 15 provides aging, financially troubled nuclear plants a $6 billion lifeline to stay open and directs billions more for research into next-generation mini-reactors. The $1.7 trillion Build Back Better legislation currently being negotiated in the Senate adds billions more in tax credits for nuclear generation. The Energy Department recently approved the country’s first permits for a next-gen small reactor and helped broker a deal for a U.S. nuclear startup to build one in Romania.Nuclear is even getting a boost on the state level. Unlike New York and California, where nuclear plants are shutting down, Illinois passed a clean-energy law in September that boosted cash-strapped reactors with new subsidies.The flurry of new policies and announcements raises the question: Are we at the dawn of a nuclear renaissance?It’s a question that’s been posed before, most recently in the mid 2000s. Though they are among the least deadly and most reliable sources of electricity, new reactors remain extremely expensive, slow to build and unpopular. But advocates and market analysts see the dual crises of rapidly worsening climate change and growing demand for dependable electricity driving a shift toward nuclear power.“When people talk about decarbonization, they talk as if it’s this mysterious thing that’s never been achieved,” said Isabelle Boemeke, a Brazilian advocate for nuclear power who tries to recast the energy source as chic with her fashion modeling and TikTok videos. “When you look at the technologies that have decarbonized grids, it’s hydro and nuclear. People are starting to realize that if they want electricity on at all times, and clean electricity, they’re going to have to have nuclear be a part of that.”Yet anti-nuclear activists say this comeback, like past ones, is at best hype and at worst a dangerous distraction that threatens to siphon away already-insufficient government funding for clean energy.“Of all the available options for keeping fossil fuels in the ground, nukes are likely the worst. This is an expensive distraction when renewables are hiding in plain sight,” said Lukas Ross, a program manager at the environmental group Friends of the Earth, which opposes nuclear power. “The nuclear industry has always been better at putting out press releases than building reactors.”Nuclear power was born into a violent time. The concept of harnessing radioactive energy was first conceived after 1934, when physicist Enrico Fermi discovered that neutrons could split atoms and artificially create radiation.Fleeing with his Jewish wife from fascist Italy’s anti-Semitic laws, Fermi ended up at the University of Chicago, where on Dec. 2, 1942, he carried out the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in a laboratory. It was almost one year after the United States, his adopted country, had entered World War II. Within months, the U.S. government recruited Fermi into the Manhattan Project.The destructive power of split atoms was revealed just three years later, when the U.S. dropped the only nuclear bombs ever used in war on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hundreds of thousands of civilians died instantly, while the invisible scourge of the radiation that lingered in the blast zone killed tens of thousands more with cancer and other diseases for years. The Soviet Union tested its first nuclear bomb just four years later, igniting the Cold War atomic arms race that would inaugurate a new human era in which the complete destruction of and by our species emerged as a distinct possibility.In 1951, a government-run experimental reactor in Idaho produced the world’s first usable electricity through atomic fission. It channeled the intense heat from a chain reaction of split uranium atoms to boil water, which spun turbines and generated power. Two years later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower pitched his vision of “atoms for peace” in a 1953 speech at the United Nations and launched a program that would continue the proliferation of atomic weapons while orienting more nuclear research to electricity generation. In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency was established to oversee the global growth of nuclear power.Construction began on nuclear reactors across the world, reflecting the fuel’s distinct benefits. Hydropower dams are geographically limited, require enormous feats of geological engineering and can be rendered useless in extreme droughts. Coal-fired plants wheeze filth into the air and produce mountains of toxic ash. Gas-fired generators spew pollution, too, and prices flutter wildly in the geopolitical winds. Nuclear plants, by contrast, produce no air pollution and can run almost 24/7.But every 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactor produces about 3 cubic meters of radioactive waste per year. In television and movies, nuclear waste is often depicted as sloshing green-glowing goo. In reality, throughout much of the world, high-level radioactive waste is simply sealed in metal containers and stored at plants, or — in the best-case scenarios — mixed with silica in a process known as vitrification, creating a solid material that looks like black glass. It is kept in stainless steel containers and sealed in concrete before being disposed of deep underground at special sites, where it takes up to 10,000 years to decay back to the radioactive levels of the original mined ore.Where and how to store waste that remains dangerous for so long has been contentious. A proposed storage site in Yucca Mountain, a remote location in the Nevada desert, would bury waste 1,000 feet underground but has faced vehement opposition from state officials and Native American tribes since it was first proposed in the 1970s, over fears that groundwater could corrode the waste receptacles and create a radioactive monster beneath their feet. Scientists have warned that, even without water intrusion, the metal containers holding nuclear waste could break down after 1,000 years. In the meantime, most waste is stored without vitrification in dry casks on site at depots and plants, where, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesperson told Scientific American in 2009, the agency could guarantee the safety of waste receptacles for “at least 90 years” ― a tiny fraction of its half-life.In what some in the industry hailed as a “game changer,” Finland is digging the world’s first deep repository for waste ― an isolated underground cavern about 1,500 feet below the Earth’s surface.The threat of radioactive waste, of course, needs to be weighed against the mounting toll of pollution from fossil fuels. Radioactive minerals dredged up during gas drilling now contaminate communities across the U.S. Toxic heavy metals from coal ash have seeped into water sources. The U.S. suffered 137 oil spills in 2018 alone. And the air pollution from burning fossil fuels already causes 1 in 5 deaths each year and is linked to increases in dementia, impotence and mental illness.There’s also the problem of mining the uranium that, with the plutonium made from processed uranium, fuels reactors. From 1944 to 1986, the U.S. extracted 4 million tons of uranium ore and then abandoned more than 500 mines in Navajo territory, leaving behind radioactive dust and mine tailings that sent local cancer rates soaring. Stewardship aside, scholars debate how much accessible nuclear fuel is even left in the world, with estimates ranging from 90 years’ worth to 200 years to maybe hundreds of thousands years if uranium could be extracted from seawater.But solar panels, wind turbines and the batteries needed to store their power rely on rare earth metals mined in Myanmar, lithium extracted from the sensitive Chilean desert and cobalt pulled from polluted communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Industry analysts fear shortages of key minerals as early as 2025 as clean-energy manufacturing booms.It was the threat of an accidental reactor meltdown, however, that ultimately stymied nuclear power’s rise. In March 1979, one of the valves that controlled the flow of coolant water to a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, jammed, causing the radioactive core to overheat. The partial meltdown that followed caused no deaths and, according to an Environmental Protection Agency report, not even one additional cancer case in the area. But the accident captivated national attention and cemented anti-nuclear activists’ fears that no reactor could ever be safe enough.Then in 1986, operator errors and design flaws led to a meltdown and series of explosions at the nuclear plant 10 miles northwest of Chernobyl, Ukraine. The disaster killed a little over two dozen workers and firefighters, and forced nearly 115,000 people to relocate away from the 1,000-square-mile irradiated exclusion zone. Estimates of how many people died from radioactive fallout vary widely. In 2005, a team of 100 U.N. scientists concluded that about 50 people had died of exposure-related diseases like thyroid cancer that were ultimately projected to kill 4,000 more. The World Health Organization pegged the number of thyroid cancer cases linked to Chernobyl alone at more than 11,000. In 2006, Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear energy, forecast the total deaths linked to the disaster at 93,000.The 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi catastrophe seemed like the final strike. An earthquake sent a tsunami wave crashing into the plant on Japan’s northeast coast, flooding the reactor’s systems and causing a meltdown. There were no attributed deaths until 2018, but the accident cast hazardous levels of radiation over 300 square miles, an area that now is populated by eerily dystopian ghost towns.Japan shut down about 50 reactors. South Korea’s ruling liberal party made the shutdown of the country’s nuclear fleet a platform issue. Germany, which had already embarked on its Energiewende policy to eliminate nuclear power, hastened its closure of reactors.In the U.S., where the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) had made natural gas cheaper than ever, nuclear power lost its appeal. As concern over climate-changing emissions grew, environmentalists who cut their teeth protesting the construction of reactors in the 1970s and 1980s embraced solar and wind as the ideal sources for zero-carbon electricity, particularly as green industrial policies in China dramatically lowered the costs of imported solar panels and wind turbines. For those worried about providing dependable 24/7 “baseload” power ― the minimal amount of electricity needed to meet demand on the grid ― there was natural gas, which produced less carbon than coal.In 2012, U.S. nuclear power generation peaked with 104 reactors. By 2021, that number fell to 93, with nearly two dozen more reactors slated for shutdown in the coming years.Nuclear seemed on the cusp of a comeback in the mid-2000s.The world was in a familiar place to today. Energy prices were soaring. The nation was still nursing the wounds of a historically disastrous storm that seemed to function as an exclamation point on scientists’ increasingly dire warnings over global warming. Seeking some way out of the chaos, President George W. Bush marshaled his party’s control of Congress, and even won over a decent number of lawmakers from the opposition party that loathed him, to pass legislation aimed at reviving the nuclear industry.The law, enacted in 2005, promised generous subsidies for power companies that stepped up to build the United States’ first new reactor in three decades. By 2007, several dozen new reactors were in various stages of the permit process.“I think the nuclear renaissance is here,” the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that year. “I believe that dirt will be turned.”But the only project to turn any real dirt soon became a money pit. Fifteen years after it was first announced, Plant Vogtle, a pair of nuclear reactors in eastern Georgia, is still under construction, announcing new delays just this month that inflated the total cost of the project to nearly $30 billion ― double its initial estimate.But in those 15 years, the climate picture has gotten even more bleak. Preventing catastrophic warming requires a dramatic reduction in fossil fuel use worldwide, and rich countries like the U.S., which has the highest per capita emissions, need to make changes even faster than the rest of the world. Yet as of last year, oil, gas and coal still accounted for about 80% of total U.S. energy consumption and 61% of electricity production.Eliminating the fossil fuels that propel vehicles, heat buildings and flame kitchen stovetops requires swapping out gas guzzlers for battery-powered trucks, furnaces for heat pumps and gas appliances for electric ones. In the U.S. alone, that could increase electricity demand nearly 40% by 2050, according to a Department of Energy study.And that isn’t accounting for the growth of other industries that could add significant demand for more electricity.There are plenty of power-hungry industries set to emerge in response to the climate crisis. Hydrogen, for example, is considered a promising fuel to decarbonize airplanes, heavy-duty trucking and steel production ― but 99% of the world’s supply of the gas relies on fossil fuels. The 1% that is considered truly “green hydrogen” depends on the energy intensive process known as electrolysis. Then there’s the issue of freshwater supplies disappearing amid prolonged droughts. Desalinating a year’s worth of seawater for just one average American household requires about as much electricity as it takes to run a refrigerator.Then there are even more risky endeavors. Each year the world blows past its emission-cutting targets, the amount of carbon that needs to be removed from the atmosphere in order to keep global warming in a relatively safe range of increase. That may well require by the end of this decade a significant deployment of direct air capture, machines that suck CO₂ from the air and render it into a liquid or solid form that can be stored underground. The technology is still nascent, but if deployed at scale in present form, the machines would need roughly one-quarter of global energy supplies by the end of this century, according to one 2019 study in the journal Nature Communications.Then there are plenty of emerging industries that have little to no climate utility, such as the rise of cryptocurrency. The computing power used to extract Bitcoin, the most popular of the decentralized digital currencies, from chains of code online already needs about as much electricity as the entire nation of Thailand, and rival online tokens are rapidly proliferating.That all makes efforts to decarbonize the U.S. electricity grid a twofold problem. The country must not only replace more than 200 coal plants and roughly 2,000 gas power stations, it also has to add enough electricity to meet growing demand.There are competing visions for how the country can do that. One involves decentralizing electricity production ― glazing every available roof with solar panels, equipping homes and businesses with batteries, and using electric vehicles as batteries, essentially distributing the job of fueling and balancing the grid among many individual producers. Another involves replacing the existing centralized capacity with enough zero-carbon alternatives to meet demand.Problems dog both approaches. In many jurisdictions, there simply isn’t enough available sunlight, wind or space to accommodate the machines that harness those resources to meet the electricity demand. And getting huge volumes of wind or solar energy from the places where they’re abundant ― the sun-soaked Southwest or the windswept Great Plains, for example ― means building many more transmission lines across states and terrains. But for much of the past two decades, that has proved incredibly difficult, thanks to Byzantine regulatory regimes and powerful local opposition. Just this month, Maine voters, spurred on by an alliance between environmentalists and fossil fuel companies, overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure barring construction of a transmission line to carry zero-carbon hydropower from Quebec into the New England electricity grid.Nuclear power faces its own hurdles, not least of which is the cost and time it takes to build a new reactor.“If you have a more narrow, technocratic mindset about the climate crisis, you ask three questions: How much carbon? How much money? And how much time?” Ross said. “The nuclear lobby only has part of a good answer for one out of three.”But unlike renewables, which largely require massive new transmission lines to scale up, nuclear plants tend to work well within the same infrastructure used to carry electricity from coal and gas plants. And reactors offer what the Energy Department described as “by far the highest capacity factor of any energy source,” meaning “nuclear power plants are producing maximum power more than 93% of the time during the year.”That makes nuclear 1.5 to 2 times more reliable than natural gas or coal. With renewables, the gap is even bigger, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.“Nuclear power has a lot of negative connotations, but it can contribute a lot to dealing with climate change,” said Chris Gadomski, the lead nuclear analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF. “The analogy I use is that it’s like you’re a football coach and for some reason you bench your best player and keep losing the game.”The future grid will likely be a varied mix of zero-carbon generation sources depending on the market, said analyst David Brown, head of American energy transitions at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.“We think, in the U.S., wind and solar will be upward of 80% of power output 30 years from now,” he said. The last 20% is “where we think new nuclear has a role,” he said.If nuclear power does, in fact, make a comeback in the U.S., its future may rest in a frontier coal town in western Wyoming.In tiny Kemmerer, Wyoming ― population just a little over 2,700 ― the startup TerraPower plans to replace an aging coal-fired plant with a set of its mini-reactors by 2028.The plant could become the commercial breakthrough the next-generation nuclear industry has been awaiting. Traditional reactors are enormous, expensive and rely on expertise that has become rarer over the last decades. But the modular reactors TerraPower plans to make are typically about one-third the size and can be assembled in a factory and transported to the plant location. This, at least in theory, dramatically cuts down the construction costs and time.Various companies and countries are competing to bring the first small modular reactors to market. Russia recently deployed a small reactor on a floating barge and docked in a Siberian port city, where it was used to heat and power homes, and it has announced plans to build more. China started building its first commercial small modular reactor on the southern island of Hainan this summer. The British government’s pledge to fund Rolls-Royce’s small modular reactor project turned out to be one of the most significant announcements of this month’s U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.TerraPower ― which billionaire Bill Gates co-founded and backed ― is charging ahead with a small modular reactor uniquely cooled with sodium, which has a higher boiling point than water and can store excess electricity for hours. It has competitors. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is in the final stages of certifying a design from NuScale Power, based in Portland, Oregon, that will likely be used for a dozen of its scaled-down water-cooled reactors at an Energy Department facility in Idaho, which will sell power to a local utility. If it wins final approvals, it would be the first small, modular reactor to get a greenlight from U.S. regulators. There are roughly 20 other companies working on similarly sized, or even smaller, reactors.Small reactors have their critics. David Schissel, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said small reactors have the same problems but in a different package.“In the 1950s, they said atomic energy would be too cheap to meter, but it hasn’t worked out that way and it won’t work out that way,” he said. “Plus, the question still remains: Where are they going to put the nuclear waste? Nobody wants it.”Even writer Michael Shellenberger, one of nuclear power’s most fervent evangelists, warned in a recent newsletter that “futuristic nuclear plants are a long ways off, which means it’s misleading at best, and self-destructive at worst, to hype nuclear technologies that only exist on paper.” Instead, he said, countries should follow the lead of France, which generates the vast majority of its electricity from nuclear reactors, and build more traditional plants.BloombergNEF’s Gadomski said small reactors just need a strong first test case to show investors that the technology is commercially viable. But neither BloombergNEF nor Wood Mackenzie expect the industry to start taking off until the 2030s.And yet nuclear power remains deeply unpopular. Dogged by pop-culture references like HBO’s “Chernobyl” series and the careless plant-safety operator Homer on “The Simpsons,” just 49% of U.S. adults said they favor nuclear power in a 2019 Gallup poll, down from a record high of 62% in 2010. Overwhelming majorities of self-identified Democrats, women and those without college degrees opposed nuclear power.An August 2020 survey from Morning Consult found 1 in 3 U.S. adults thinks the country should keep existing nuclear plants open but not build any new reactors. Just 16% of respondents said the U.S. should build more reactors, and just 6% said the country should keep current plants running, build more reactors and promote nuclear-power programs overseas.But nuclear power suffers from a “perception gap,” according to an analysis last year from Bisconti Research, a polling firm that frequently examines public attitudes on atomic energy and has routinely found more favorable opinions than other surveys.“The U.S. public perceives public opinion toward nuclear energy as less favorable than their own opinion. This perception gap can lead persons who favor nuclear energy to fear speaking out in support of nuclear energy,” the analysis concluded. “That silence, in turn, could reinforce erroneous perceptions of public opinion.”Nuclear power advocates hope those numbers could start to shift as the scale of the planet’s emissions crisis comes into clearer focus.“There have been years of indecisiveness, but the climate is changing around nuclear,” said Kirsty Gogan, managing director of the British clean-energy think tank Terra Praxis.Another is that renewables alone have not proved to be completely reliable. Throughout this past summer and autumn, Europe experienced less wind than usual, adding to the energy crunch that has sent prices soaring across the continent. The British power company SSE, for example, said the lack of rain and wind led its hydropower and wind turbine facilities to produce 32% less electricity than expected.It remains unclear why the wind stopped blowing as hard, but recent studies have shown that climate change could reduce gusts in what one researcher called the threat of “global stilling.”Though few credibly argue against investing in renewables, the shortfalls show the need for more zero-carbon sources of power that can run with as little interruption as fossil fuel plants. She compared the role nuclear could play to the way plant-based meat giant Impossible Foods offered a compelling substitute for beef.“We need Impossible burgers for energy, a drop-in substitute,” she said. “We’re not bending the curve on emissions because in the power sector we still need reliability, making the idea that we’re going to phase out coal unforgivably unrealistic right now.”CORRECTION: This story was amended to note that the NuScale design is still in the final phases of regulatory approval and to clarify details about the Fukushima disaster and nuclear processes."}, {"title": "Albatross 'Divorces' May Be Climbing Because Of Climate Change", "text": "One of the most famously monogamous species of birds may be driven to “divorce” their partners at higher rates as a result of a warming planet, a new study found.Black-browed albatrosses have the reputation of mating for life and usually stick with one partner after pairing off. Usually, only 1% to 3% of albatross pairs split up and find new mates, according to The Guardian.But that rose to as much as 8% during years of unusually warm water temperatures, according to researchers who analyzed data involving more than 15,000 albatross pairs in the Falkland Islands over a 15-year period. The study was published in the Royal Society journal this week.Scientists have long known that albatross pairs may divorce, typically involving the female finding a new mate, if they had an unsuccessful breeding season. But researchers found that in unusually warm years, breakup rates rose even among pairs that had successfully reproduced.So why might warmer waters have this kind of effect? For one thing, warmer waters mean that phytoplankton, organisms that form the foundation of the marine food chain, are less plentiful. As Scientific American noted, the scarcity of phytoplankton has cascading effects up the food chain and, in this case, means that albatrosses must fly farther and work harder to find enough food.In some cases, birds may simply have traveled farther afield and not returned in time for breeding season, leading their partners to find a new mate, University of Lisbon researcher and study co-author Francesco Ventura told The Guardian.Ventura also said harsher temperatures and having to work harder to eat raises stress levels in the birds overall, and it’s possible that the birds may more or less blame their partner for their unhappiness.​“We propose this partner-blaming hypothesis ― with which a stressed female might feel this physiological stress, and attribute these higher stress levels to a poor performance of the male,” he said.Earlier this month, a different study was published that documented another way that human-caused climate change seems to be affecting birds. That study found that birds in the Amazon rainforest are getting smaller in size as temperatures get hotter."}, {"title": "Biden Administration Wants To Up Cost For Oil And Gas Drilling On Public Lands", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Friday recommended an overhaul of the nation’s oil and gas leasing program to focus on areas that are most suitable for energy development and raise costs for energy companies to drill on public lands and water.The long-awaited report by the Interior Department stops short of recommending an end to oil and gas leasing on public lands, as many environmental groups have urged. But officials said the report would move toward a more responsible leasing process that provides a better to return to U.S. taxpayers for oil and gas drilling on the nation’s vast public lands and waters.“Our nation faces a profound climate crisis that is impacting every American,″ Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement, adding that the new report’s recommendations will provide a fair return to taxpayers and mitigate worsening climate impacts “while staying steadfast in the pursuit of environmental justice.″The report completes a review ordered in January by President Joe Biden, who directed a pause in federal oil and gas lease sales in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change.The moratorium drew sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry, even as many environmentalists and Democrats said Biden should make the leasing pause permanent.The new report seeks a middle ground that would continue the multibillion-dollar leasing program while reforming it to end what many officials consider overly favorable terms for the industry.The leasing program has drawn renewed focus in recent weeks as gasoline prices have skyrocketed and Republicans complained that Biden policies including the leasing moratorium, rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and a ban on oil leasing in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge contributed to the price spike.Biden on Tuesday ordered a record 50 million barrels of oil released from America’s strategic reserve, aiming to bring down gas prices amid concerns about inflation. Gasoline prices are at about $3.40 a gallon, more than 50% higher than a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.The Biden administration conducted a lease sale on federal oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Mexico last week, after attorneys general from Republican-led states successfully sued in federal court to lift a suspension on federal oil and gas sales that Biden imposed when he took office."}, {"title": "Biden Gulf Oil Sale Means More Drilling Within Legacy Chemical Dump Site", "text": "The Biden administration’s oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico last week doesn’t just lock in decades of future drilling and greenhouse gas emissions, it also opens up more extraction in an area where chemical companies dumped tons of hazardous industrial waste.Off the coast of Louisiana, in an area known as Mississippi Canyon, thousands of 55-gallon drums containing decades-old toxic waste remain scattered across a 200-square-mile stretch of ocean floor, as HuffPost revealed earlier this year. Chemical giants received federal permits to dump waste material there in the 1970s, and there has been little oversight of the area in the decades since.The Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged it is not monitoring the legacy dumping ground and has little if any understanding of the lingering environmental impacts. In light of HuffPost’s reporting, the agency said it had launched an assessment to determine whether the site qualifies for cleanup under the federal Superfund program.But the decades-old waste hasn’t deterred fossil fuel interests in the area. Oil and gas companies are already drilling within the barrel field, with federal agencies allowing them to determine how best to avoid and reduce impacts to existing drums. In fact, it was a Shell drilling plan that shed light on the condition of remaining barrels, noting that many “still look intact” and “may or may not still contain their original content.”During last week’s auction — the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in U.S. history — Chevron Corp., Murphy Exploration & Production Co., and Houston Energy LP secured new drilling rights on offshore leasing blocks where barrels have been located.Chevron paid $256,442.40 to lease two blocks that are part of the dumping ground. Murphy Exploration and Houston Energy paid $154,362.80 and $151,744.80, respectively, to lease one block each.Those three companies did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment.As with previous Gulf lease sales, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management alerted would-be bidders of the “inactive industrial waste disposal site” in its final sale notice.“The site was established by the [Environmental Protection Agency] in 1973 under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act to permit the seafloor deposition of approximately 205,000 steel barrels containing chemical wastes and chlorinated hydrocarbons,” reads the notice. “Bidders and lessees are advised that the blocks associated with the disposal site and adjacent blocks that are included in the sale area may exhibit hazards from barrel contents (toxic, corrosive, and/or potentially explosive materials).”The document lists leasing blocks where barrels are known to exist, but that likely doesn’t paint a full picture. Ocean surveys have turned up barrels as far as 10 miles from the designated dump boundary, according to past notices to lessees.At the Mississippi Canyon site, fuel additive company Ethyl Corp. got EPA approval to dump approximately 19,000 barrels of waste sludge containing liquid metal salts and calcium — drums that could still pose an explosive hazard. And DuPont jettisoned at least 1,300 barrels of waste, including “a wide variety of inorganic salts, industrial organics and chlorinated hydrocarbons” from its facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, according to a 1975 National Academy of Sciences report on ocean contaminants.Chlorinated hydrocarbons, or CHCs, are a family of toxic chemicals that can persist in the environment and become concentrated in marine organisms.Scientists HuffPost previously interviewed voiced concerns about the potential for these substances migrating up the food chain, where they could pose a risk to human health. They also argued oil giant Shell’s internal policy of maintaining a 33-foot standoff distance from barrels is insufficient to keep from disturbing remaining contents.“Hazards surveys are required before bottom-disturbing activities can be approved in plans and permits,” the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management wrote in its notice for last week’s Gulf sale. “Drilling and platform/pipeline placement may require precautions, such as avoidance (recommended 30-foot minimum distance from individual barrels), decontamination of equipment, and personnel health and safety procedures.”An EPA spokeswoman told HuffPost it is on pace to complete its initial Superfund screening by the end of the year.It is unclear whether BOEM considered excluding portions of Mississippi Canyon from its recent lease sale pending the outcome of the EPA’s assessment. BOEM spokesperson John Filostrat said the bureau is not in a position to comment on the EPA’s pending report.“For Sale 257, BOEM included lease exclusions and stipulations to protect biologically sensitive resources, mitigate potential adverse effects on protected species, and avoid potential conflicts between oil and gas development and other activities and users in the Gulf of Mexico,” he said via email. “Prior to any activity taking place on the Outer Continental Shelf, companies are required to survey the seafloor and shallow water sediments to identify potential hazards before conducting any bottom disturbing activities. This allows for any hazards to be avoided.”Environmentalists and climate activists forcefully decried the Biden administration’s Gulf of Mexico lease sale last week, which stands at clear odds with the president’s own climate goals and comes at a time when the world can least afford wealthy nations expanding fossil fuel development.The auction ultimately brought in more than $191 million, with oil and gas companies purchasing rights to drill across more than 1.7 million offshore acres — an area larger than the state of Delaware."}, {"title": "South Dakota Supreme Court Rules Against Pot Legalization", "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — The South Dakota Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a lower court’s ruling that nullified a voter-passed amendment to the state constitution that would have legalized recreational marijuana use.Gov. Kristi Noem instigated the legal fight to strike down the amendment passed by voters in November. Though the Republican governor opposed marijuana legalization as a social ill, her administration’s arguments in court centered on technical violations to the state constitution.The court sided with those arguments, ruling that the measure would have violated the state’s requirement that constitutional amendments deal with just one subject and would have created broad changes to state government.About 54% of voters had approved the amendment — known as Amendment A — to legalize adult recreational pot use, medical marijuana and hemp cultivation. But Highway Patrol Superintendent Col. Rick Miller sued on Noem’s behalf. Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom also joined the lawsuit.The state Supreme Court’s decision upheld a circuit court judge’s ruling in February. Advocates for pot legalization had appealed, arguing that the Supreme Court should dismiss the legal challenge because it would overturn the will of voters and dampen their future ability to enact laws through the ballot box.Marijuana has become broadly accepted around the United States, with a Gallup Poll in November showing 68% of Americans favored legalization. South Dakota was among four states that month to approve recreational marijuana, along with New Jersey, Arizona and Montana. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have done so.A separate, voter-passed law that legalizes medical marijuana is set to take effect in South Dakota on July 1."}, {"title": "Midas The '4-Eared' Rescue Kitten Is Quadruply Cute", "text": "A sweet gray kitten’s unique appearance has her earmarked for internet fame.Midas, now 4 months old, has two normal ear canals, but each one has two earflaps, giving her a “four-eared” appearance. She was born in a backyard in Ankara, Turkey, and ultimately adopted by a family who was looking for a rescue cat and wanted to make sure Midas found a home, fearing others might be put off by her slightly kooky look, owner Canis Dosemeci told Reuters.“We have never thought of buying a cat, we just wanted to rescue a cat from the street, and we wanted to adopt her,” Dosemeci said.She and her family chose the name Midas in reference to the king from Greek mythology who was said to be able to turn everything he touched to gold. As the myth goes, Midas ended up offending the god Apollo, who punished the king by giving him donkey ears.While the donkey ears were a huge source of shame to the mythical king, they seem to be a plus for the real cat. Though some people find her look “scary,” Dosemeci said, most are taken with how cute she is. The cat now has more than 82,000 followers on her Instagram account, where some of Dosemeci’s other pets also make the occasional cameo.Another piece of good news: The extra earflaps don’t cause her any negative health effects, Dosemeci’s veterinarian told Reuters. The news outlet also noted that Midas has a defective jaw ― both conditions are believed to be caused by a genetic mutation ― but it’s unclear if that causes any problems for her.That said, Midas is clearly enjoying life, unaware of her fame in the wide world.“She is a very playful cat.

NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars.“I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.Submitted plans for the fission surface power system should include a uranium-fueled reactor core, a system to convert the nuclear power into usable energy, a thermal management system to keep the reactor cool, and a distribution system providing no less than 40 kilowatts of continuous electric power for 10 years in the lunar environment.Some other requirements include that it be capable of turning itself off and on without human help, that it be able to operate from the deck of a lunar lander, and that it can be removed from the lander and run on a mobile system and be transported to a different lunar site for operation.Additionally, when launched from Earth to the moon, it should fit inside a 12-foot (4-meter) diameter cylinder that’s 18 feet (6 meters) long. It should not weigh more than 13,200 pounds (6,000 kilograms).The proposal requests are for an initial system design and must be submitted by Feb. 19.The Idaho National Laboratory has worked with NASA on various projects in the past. Most recently, the lab helped power NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance with a radioisotope power system, which converts heat generated by the natural decay of plutonium-238 into electrical power.The car-sized rover landed on Mars in February and has remained active on the red planet.The Energy Department has also been working to team up with private businesses on various nuclear power plans, notably on a new generation of smaller power plants that range from small modular reactors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and then removed when not needed."}, {"title": "California Wildfires Killed Nearly 20% Of Earth's Giant Sequoias", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, adding to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday.Fires in Sequoia National Park and the surrounding national forest that also bears the trees’ name tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 and 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Fires in the same area last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 of the 75,000 trees that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.Intense fires that burned hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias — trees once considered nearly fire-proof — puts an exclamation point on the impact of climate change. The combination of a warming planet that has created hotter droughts and a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled blazes that have sounded the death knell for trees that date back to ancient civilizations.“The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. “As spectacular as these trees are we really can’t take them for granted. To ensure that they’re around for our kids and grandkids and great grandkids, some action is necessary.”California has seen its largest fires in the past five years, with last year setting a record for most acreage burned. So far, the second-largest amount of land has burned this year.After last year’s Castle and SQF Complex fires took officials by surprise by wiping out so many sequoias, extraordinary measures were taken to save the largest and oldest trees this year.The General Sherman tree — the largest living thing on earth — and other ancient trees that are the backdrop for photos that often fail to capture grandeur of the giant sequoias was wrapped in a foil blanket.A type of fire-retardant gel, similar to that used as absorbent in baby’s diapers, was dropped on tree canopies that can exceed 200 feet (60 meters) in height. Sprinklers watered down trunks and flammable matter was raked away from trees.The measures spared the Giant Forest, the premiere grove of ancient trees in the park, but the measures couldn’t be deployed everywhere.The bulk of the Suwanee grove in the park burned in an extreme fire in the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River drainage. The Starvation Complex grove in Sequoia National Forest was largely destroyed, based on estimates of how much of it burned at high-severity.In 2013, the park had done climate modeling that predicted extreme fires wouldn’t jeopardize sequoias for another 50 years, said Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science at the two parks. But that was at the start of what became a punishing five-year drought that essentially broke the model.Amid the drought in 2015, the park saw giant sequoias torched for the first time. Two fires in 2017 killed more giant sequoias, serving as a warning for what was to come.“Then the Castle Fire happened and it was like, ‘Oh, my God,’” Brigham said. “We went from the warning sign to hair on fire. To lose 7,000 trees in one fire is crazy.”A full mortality count from last year’s fire is still not available because crews in the forest were in the process of confirming how many trees died when lightning struck Sept. 9, igniting the Windy Fire in Sequoia National Forest and the SQF Complex in the park, Brigham said.Not all the news from the estimates was bleak.While fire burned into 27 groves and large numbers of trees were incinerated, a lot of low-intensity fire that sequoias need to thrive cleared out vegetation and the heat will open cones so they can spread their seeds.Areas, however, where fire burned so hot and seeds were killed, may not be able to regenerate. For the first time, the park is considering planting seedlings to preserve the species.“I’m not ready to give up on giant sequoias,” Brigham said."}, {"title": "Deb Haaland Declares 'Squaw' A Derogatory Term, Orders Removal From Federal Lands", "text": "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday created a new process for reviewing and replacing derogatory names currently used on federal lands, and moved forward with immediately getting rid of one of those words: “squaw.”The term has historically been used as a racist and sexist slur, particularly aimed at Native American women. There are currently more than 650 federal land units that use the word, according to a database maintained by the Board on Geographic Names, which is the federal board tasked with naming geographic places.“Racist terms have no place in our vernacular or on our federal lands,” Haaland said in a statement. “Our nation’s lands and waters should be places to celebrate the outdoors and our shared cultural heritage ― not to perpetuate the legacies of oppression.”The interior secretary announced her plan via two secretarial orders on Friday.The first order formally identifies “squaw” as derogatory and creates a federal task force to find replacement names for geographic features on federal lands bearing the word. The newly created Derogatory Geographic Names Task Force will include representatives from federal land management agencies, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion experts from the Interior Department. The order also requires that the task force consult with tribes and consider public feedback on proposed name changes.The second order creates a federal advisory committee to solicit, review and recommend changes to other derogatory geographic and federal land unit names. The Advisory Committee on Reconciliation in Place Names will include representation from tribes, tribal organizations and experts on civil rights, anthropology and history.The orders effectively speed up the process by which the Board on Geographic Names currently reviews and changes names used on federal lands. As of now, the board acts on a case-by-case basis that puts the onus on proponents to identify an offensive name and suggest a replacement. The process often takes years, and there are hundreds of names currently pending before the board.Previous interior secretaries have identified and replaced derogatory names used on federal lands. In 1962, Secretary Stewart Udall identified the N-word as derogatory and directed a process for getting rid of it. In 1974, the Board on Geographic Names identified a pejorative term for “Japanese” as derogatory and eliminated its use, too.A handful of states have passed bills prohibiting the use of “squaw” in the their official names of places, including in Montana, Oregon, Maine and Minnesota. There’s also legislation pending in Congress aimed at changing derogatory names on geographic features on public land units."}, {"title": "More Americans Than Ever Understand Climate Change Is Real And Harmful", "text": "More Americans than ever now understand that global warming is real, harmful and directly impacting their local communities.In a nationally representative survey of 1,006 American adults conducted by Yale University’s program on climate change communication, about three-quarters of respondents (76%) said they think global warming is happening — up from 57% in 2010. Meanwhile, some 12% said they think global warming is not happening.More than half (55%) said that people in the U.S. are being harmed by climate change “right now,” according to the survey, which was conducted online from Sept. 10–20. This is up from the 24% who thought so in 2010.And for the first time since the group began these surveys in 2008, a majority of respondents — 54% — said that they have experienced the effects of global warming personally.Over the past year, we’ve seen the hottest July ever recorded on the planet (again), the largest ever single wildfire in California history (again, just a year after the last one), and deadly hurricanes and floods devastating the Gulf and Atlantic coasts (again).“After a brutal year of record heatwaves, fires, floods, and storms... Americans are increasingly convinced global warming is real, human-caused, and dangerous — right here, right now,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of Yale’s climate change communication program.The United Nations’ recent climate report repeated what similar reports have been saying for years, with even greater certainty: Humans are the “unequivocal” cause of climate change, and the window to avoid catastrophic living conditions worldwide due to global warming is rapidly closing.However, Yale’s survey found that only 60% of respondents understand that global warming is mostly human-caused — though, encouragingly, this is up from 46% in 2010. By contrast, about one-quarter (27%) said they think global warming is due mostly to natural changes in the environment.It is worth noting that Americans are deeply politically divided on climate change. About 72% of Democrats say human activity is contributing “a great deal” to climate change, versus just 22% of Republicans, according to Pew Research Center. A vast majority of Democrats say climate change is affecting their local community (83%), while less than half of Republicans say so (37%).The communities most vulnerable to climate change — including those experiencing slower recoveries in the aftermath of climate disasters — are disproportionately poor, Black and Latinx.More Americans than ever are worried about global warming: 70% of those surveyed said they were at least “somewhat worried” and, of those, about one-third (35%) were “very worried” — the highest percentage since these surveys began.Climate experts HuffPost spoke to in August urged people who are anxious about the climate crisis to do one thing: Take action. Even though changes are needed at a massive scale, including actions by governments and corporations to reduce fossil fuel emissions, it doesn’t mean individuals can’t also make a difference.“If you feel safe, if you feel distant, it means you’re not aware of your vulnerabilities,” said Isabel Rivera-Collazo, an assistant professor on human adaptation to climate change at the University of California, San Diego. “Climate change is so big, everyone is being threatened.”"}, {"title": "Trump Official Who Was Ex-NRA Lobbyist Repeatedly Broke Ethics Pledge: Watchdog", "text": "Ben Cassidy, a high-ranking Interior Department official in the Trump administration, repeatedly violated ethics rules by communicating with and directly participating in matters that involved his longtime former employer, the National Rifle Association, the department’s internal watchdog concluded in a new report.The report from Interior’s Office of Inspector General does not identify the official by name, referring simply to a “senior political employee.” But its details, while vague, leave no doubt that the employee in question is Cassidy, who left a high-paying lobbying gig at the NRA in 2017 for a powerful post in then-President Donald Trump’s administration.As investigators detail in the report, Cassidy communicated frequently throughout the fall of 2017 with a former NRA colleague and participated in the selection of members for a pair of Interior advisory councils. An NRA representative was ultimately chosen for both boards.The inspector general found those activities violated Trump’s 2017 “drain the swamp” ethics order, which among other things barred executive branch appointees from participating “in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients” for two years. (Trump revoked the order the day before he left office, allowing members of his administration to immediately resume lobbying.)Thursday’s report comes an astonishing four years after Cassidy’s misconduct, and more than two and a half years after Interior’s watchdog opened an ethics probe into alleged violations by Cassidy and five other Trump-era Interior officials who maintained close ties to former employers. A few months after Cassidy got wrapped up in the investigation, he left his position as the Interior Department’s senior deputy director of intergovernmental and external affairs to join Safari Club International, a Washington-based trophy hunting advocacy group that, like the NRA, had close ties to the Trump administration.HuffPost first reported in 2018 that Cassidy played a sizable role in getting then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s controversial International Wildlife Conservation Council off the ground, serving as a point person for the board’s 16 members during a two-day visit to Washington. The council was stacked with gun and trophy hunting advocates, including Cassidy’s former colleague Erica Rhoad, the director of hunting policy at the NRA. Chris Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, was later appointed to a separate committee called the Hunting and Shooting Sports Conservation Council.Freelance reporter Jimmy Tobias later unearthed emails showing the extent to which Cassidy provided the gun lobby access to the federal agency. In a January 2020 report in The Guardian, Tobias detailed how Cassidy fielded council nominees from Rhoad and communicated regularly with Susan Recce, director of the NRA’s conservation, wildlife and natural resources program, on topics that included agency proposals to restrict recreational shooting on public lands in Arizona and Utah.The inspector general’s report includes a tick-tock of Cassidy’s email communications with Recce, which Tobias obtained only after suing Interior under the Freedom of Information Act. Tobias shared the documents with HuffPost.“Hi Susan! Hope you are great!” Cassidy wrote in an October 2017 email.“Do you have a quick moment to hop on the phone and discuss recreational shooting in the sonoran desert?”“I am so happy for you,” Recce responded. “I think you will find the experience very rewarding.” Recce attached a comment letter that NRA submitted earlier that year recommending more of Arizona’s Sonoran Desert National Monument remain open to recreational shooting.“Thank you so much, Susan!,” Cassidy replied. “It has already been an incredible experience coming on board.”He added: “Thank you for sharing. I look forward to working with you in my new capacity!”Here’s how the inspector general’s report summarizes that 2017 exchange:The inspector general’s office interviewed Cassidy as part of its investigation. He claimed that after an initial ethics training it was his understanding that “communications with a former employer were allowed as long as at least five or more organizations were part of the conversation,” the report noted.But many of Cassidy’s emails with Recce were one on one.An Interior ethics attorney told investigators that they did not recall Cassidy asking for approval to communicate with former colleagues. If he had, “it would have been — an easy question to answer,” the attorney told Interior’s watchdog, repeating the requirement for five or more organizations to be part of any conversation.The report found that while Cassidy met with agency ethics officials several times shortly after his appointment to discuss matters he was recused from working on, he did not receive formal ethics guidance until Spring 2019, well after the misconduct occurred.“We found no further communications between the senior political employee and representatives of the former employer after the senior political employee received this guidance,” the report stated.It is unclear why it took Interior’s 300-employee Office of Inspector General took so long to produce the report, why it does not name Cassidy or why it limited the scope of its investigation to violations of the ethics pledge, rather than also probing whether Cassidy broke federal ethics rules.The Office of Inspector General did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Thursday.Safari Club International, where Cassidy now works as director of government affairs, also did not immediately respond.The report itself is of no consequence. Cassidy is no longer a federal employee and the Trump-era ethics pledge he broke no longer exists. As with other ethics probes, the inspector general simply forwarded its findings to the Interior Department’s Office of the Secretary for review and possible action.“This report focuses on a timeframe well before the Department implemented significant changes and resources to its ethics program,” Theresa Eisenman, an agency spokesperson, said in an email. “For example, we now have a consolidated Departmental Ethics Office under the leadership of a career designated agency ethics official. We’ve also increased staffing in the Ethics Office to enhance ethics services for our employee, including a focus on training for onboarding appointees.”Under Trump, the Interior Department was plagued by scandal. Cassidy joins several other top department officials found to have violated ethics rules, with little or no consequences. And Trump’s first interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, resigned amid numerous investigations into his conduct.Aaron Weiss, deputy director of conservation group Center for Western Priorities, said the report is “more proof that blatant corruption was a feature, not a bug” under Zinke and Trump’s second interior secretary David Bernhardt.“Doing favors for old buddies was expected and encouraged,” Weiss said via email. “It’s unfortunate that this report, which mostly regurgitates reporting from years ago, took so long to release. Ethics pledges are only meaningful if there are consequences for breaking them.”"}, {"title": "At The Sierra Club, A Fierce Dispute Over Founder's Legacy Continues", "text": "The Sierra Club’s board of directors voted last Friday to officially admonish two members who have publicly defended the legacy of the group’s famed founder, John Muir, against allegations of racism.One of those board members is Aaron Mair, who previously served as the group’s first African American president. The other, Chad Hanson, is a prominent forest ecologist and activist. Both have pushed back against news stories over the past year and a half arguing that Muir was racist and sought to exclude Black and Indigenous people from protected landscapes, a claim they say the historical record does not support. With last week’s vote, the board deemed both men’s “conduct to be lacking,” and sought to hold them “accountable,” according to internal records obtained by HuffPost.The Sierra Club, one of the nation’s oldest and largest environmental groups, is weathering a series of intense internal controversies over race and identity, workplace culture, organizational structure, and the legacy of Muir, who founded the Club in 1892. It is part of a broader upheaval within the American environmental movement, one that has seen high-profile resignations at organizations like the Audubon Society and public feuding at groups like the Sunrise Movement.The Sierra Club’s internal Muir conflict kicked off in earnest in the summer of 2020, as protests and riots over the police murder of George Floyd spread across the nation. That July, Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune published a statement titled “Pulling Down Our Monuments” in which he accused his organization of “perpetuating white supremacy” and, in some cases throughout the Club’s long history, causing “immeasurable harm.”Among other things, Brune denounced Muir for “making derogatory comments about Black people and Indigenous peoples that drew on deeply harmful racist stereotypes” and for his friendship with men like Henry Fairfield Osborn, who would eventually become a leading eugenicist. The statement sent shock waves through the conservation movement, and it was widely picked up in the mainstream press.But it did not sit well with Mair, Hanson, or another longtime Sierra Club supporter, Mary Ann Nelson, who was the first African American elected to the Club’s volunteer national board. Together, the trio penned a detailed response to Brune’s statement. They sought to challenge Brune’s article as well as other media portrayals of Muir, including a March 2021 essay in Sierra magazine by the author Rebecca Solnit that aligned with Brune’s perspective.According to minutes from the March 10 Sierra Club board meeting, Hanson, Mair and Nelson tried to place their response in the magazine earlier this year, but a majority of the board blocked them from publishing their rebuttal before it made it through the magazine’s editorial process.Those minutes, which Politico first reported on, note that the board passed a resolution stating that it “reviewed the article submitted to Sierra Magazine by Directors Hanson and Mair and former Director Nelson and finds it to be inconsistent with the messaging guidance adopted by resolution on February 27 and thus should not be published in Sierra Magazine or posted on its website.”The minutes note that the board did, however, grant Hanson and Mair permission to share their opinion in other venues, provided they “use independent channels and clearly state that their views are not those of the Board of Directors nor the Sierra Club.”Ultimately, Hanson, Mair and Nelson took their article elsewhere, publishing a lengthy exploration of Muir’s record in Earth Island Journal on Aug. 11.“It’s important to think critically about our movement’s historical figures, John Muir included,” the trio wrote. “However, some recent articles by environmentalists and environmental writers — though perhaps guided by good intentions, and well-written and researched in other respects — contain some inaccurate and unfounded information that could create damaging divisions among the conservation movement and environmental justice advocates. We aim to set the record straight.”While acknowledging that Muir used derogatory racial language in some of his early writings, the three authors noted that “Muir did not promote removal of Native peoples from ancestral lands, nor did he promote exclusion of Black Americans from protected lands.” Insinuations that Muir aligned with white supremacist and eugenicist views, they wrote, are also factually wrong.On the contrary, they argued, Muir criticized the U.S. government’s “mean, brutal policy” towards Native Americans, his views evolved as he became a leading conservationist, and his overall vision “spoke to the harmony and connection of people and creation, not racial hierarchy or human dominance.”In their article, Mair, Hanson and Nelson explicitly stated that they were representing “their own views and are not speaking on behalf of the Sierra Club.” (Brune announced his resignation from the Club days after the trio published their piece, in an apparent coincidence.)Mair, Hanson and Nelson also spoke with Politico, which published a story on Aug. 16 about the controversy. Mair told Politico that Brune’s depiction of the writings and life of John Muir was “ahistorical” and “revisionist.” Hanson said that while he believed it was important to acknowledge the group’s history concerning racism, “false allegations” were damaging to the organization and the environmental movement more broadly.The article and public statements angered some in the organization, including members of the Progressive Workers Union, which represents some Sierra Club staff. A letter sent in late August that HuffPost has reviewed included a range of concerns about the Club’s internal culture. The union complained that Hanson and Mair had “centered Sierra Club’s problems around John Muir in a public way in recent weeks, misconstruing the truth of the issues within our community and harming staff in the process.”As part of its official action last week ― which appears to be a sort of internal scolding for the record that is less severe than a formal censure ― the board put forward a pair of “accountability resolutions” that chastised Hanson and Mair for conduct that has “caused significant and ongoing harm to our organization” and “sparked widespread concerns” from staff, volunteers and more, according to multiple sources and internal Sierra Club records that HuffPost obtained.The resolutions reprimanded Mair and Hanson for speaking to Politico “without authorization and without notifying designated spokespeople or communications staff,” and for publishing an article deemed “inconsistent with the positions and messaging guidelines on Sierra Club history that the Board of Directors had previously adopted.” It also chastised them for including their official Sierra Club leadership titles in the published piece.In an email to Club leaders prior to the vote, Hanson and Mair defended their conduct, arguing that the charges against them were baseless and that they had acted in accordance with their board responsibilities.“Well-founded criticisms of key historical figures are often warranted and valuable, but inaccurate and misleading attacks, such as those leveled against John Muir in some recent Sierra Club posts/articles, can widen divisions and cause unnecessary harm, including financial harm to the Sierra Club,” they wrote. “We have expressed this concern all along, consistent with our fiduciary duties as Directors. Notably, we have now seen tangible evidence of severe financial harm caused to the Sierra Club by the current Board majority’s factually-challenged attacks on Muir, in the form of the loss of a $100 million donation.”In the end, a majority of the board voted to pass the accountability resolutions and officially admonish the two men, according to multiple sources present for the meeting, which was open to Club members.Hanson and Mair both declined to comment for this story, with Mair saying he “would be sanctioned” if he did so.

The auction brought in more than $191 million in high bids.Oil giant ExxonMobil accounted for nearly one-third of all submitted bids.The sale dwarfed the Trump administration’s final Gulf lease sale in 2020, when 518,000 acres went for $121 million. And it comes just days after United Nations climate summit in Scotland, where President Joe Biden and his team promised U.S. leadership during “a decisive decade” for confronting the threat of global climate change.The Biden administration argued its hands were tied and it could not stop the offshore auction, following the June decision by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana that struck down Biden’s executive order in January temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters. But environmental lawyers told HuffPost the administration had options for scaling back, delaying or halting the sale, including requesting that an appeals court stay — or suspend — the injunction.Biden’s Justice Department appealed the Louisiana ruling in August and submitted its first brief in the case on Tuesday, the day before the auction.“We believe the decision is wrong,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a Monday briefing. “We’re required to comply with the injunction. It’s a legal case and legal process, but it’s important for advocates and other people out there who are following this to understand that it’s not aligned with our view, the President’s policies, or the executive order that he signed.”Environmental groups sent out a frenzy of statements this week condemning the administration for proceeding with a sale that many have described as a “carbon bomb.”“This morning was met with extreme disappointment, depleted hope, and shattered trust,” said Hallie Templeton, legal director at Friends of the Earth. “We are left aghast that the administration has ignored its clear authority to defer the sale and our final hope lies with the federal court to remedy these violations.”In September, Earthjustice sued the administration on behalf of several environmental groups in an attempt to block the Gulf lease sale."}, {"title": "Florida Bear Freed From Plastic Container That Was Stuck On Head For 1 Month", "text": "It was hard to bear, but a bear in Florida finally had a plastic container removed from its head after nearly a month.Florida Fish and Wildlife officials announced on Monday that the bear was first sighted with the plastic container on its head in Collier County a while back, but disappeared from human sight for more than three weeks.But things recently came to a head after the bear was filmed by a resident’s security camera, according to the department’s Facebook page.A bear biologist managed to spot the 250-pound female bear around midnight and tranquilized it with a dart before removing the plastic container from around the animal’s face.“We think it was part of an automatic pet feeder due to the hole near the bear’s muzzle,” the Facebook post read. “Luckily that hole provided enough access to drink and eat.

Neither the initial change nor a future 20-year ban would affect existing oil and gas leases or any mineral development on private, state or tribal lands, Interior said.In a post to Twitter, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said the action “marks the beginning of the end of short-term policies that shift every year to the long-term certainty that #ChacoCanyon will be protected.”“This is one of the most precious landscapes on Earth and holds deep meaning for Tribes, Pueblos, & communities in northern New Mexico,” Heinrich wrote.Heinrich and other members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation sent a letter to Haaland last week calling on her to use her authority to safeguard areas outside the park’s boundary.The administration’s effort to protect the greater Chaco area comes on the heels of the United Nations climate conference, where President Joe Biden and his team promised world leaders that the U.S would lead in confronting climate change and slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions."}, {"title": "Researchers Discover More Than 100 'Herd' Dinosaur Eggs In Argentina", "text": "Jurassic Park, here we come. Archeologists have discovered more than 100 dinosaur eggs, many with intact embryos, in the southern Patagonia region of Argentina in what they say is the oldest known evidence of a complex dinosaur herd.Scientists also uncovered fossilized bones of 80 dinosaurs of all ages nearby, providing further evidence of a community of a Jurassic-era species called Mussaurus patagonicus, according to the research published last month in the British journal Scientific Reports.The bones were segregated by age, with eggs in a common nesting ground. Juveniles likely were left in “schools” while adults foraged, according to the researchers.“This may mean that the young were not following their parents in a small family structure,” said Jahandar Ramezani, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who participated in the research. “There’s a larger community structure, where adults shared and took part in raising the whole community.”The “discoveries indicate the presence of social cohesion throughout life and age-segregation within a herd structure, in addition to colonial nesting behavior,” the article says. “These findings provide the earliest evidence of complex social behavior in Dinosauria.”The two-legged adult herbivores had a long neck, grew to lengths of some 20 feet, and weighed about 1.5 tons. They walked the earth some 200 million years ago, and were functioning in herds 40 million years earlier than previously known.Lead researcher Diego Pol, a paleontologist of the Edigio Feruglio Paleontological Museum in Trelew, Argentina, called the archeology site “one of a kind.” It’s a “pretty dramatic scene from 193 million years ago that was frozen in time,” he added.The nesting ground includes “delicate and tiny dinosaur skeletons as well as eggs with embryos inside,” Pol told Reuters.The “specimens we have found showed that herd behavior was present in long-necked dinosaurs since their early history,” Pol added. “These were social animals, and we think this may be an important factor to explain their success.”When their luck ran out, the herd most likely died from a mass-death event like a drought, archeologists believe.Another team of archeologists announced last month that they had extracted 30 titanosaur eggs from fossilized nests in a two-ton rock in northern Spain. There may be another 70 eggs still buried in nests deeper within the rock, which indicates a communal nesting site.Titanosaurs were long-tailed four-legged herbivores with necks up to 66 feet long."}, {"title": "Birds In The Amazon Rainforest Are Shrinking As Temperatures Rise", "text": "The results of a study on birds in the Amazon rainforest has shown that birds have gotten physically smaller over the last four decades, and scientists believe that a warming planet may be the reason.“This study is an example of climate change — human actions globally — affecting a fundamental thing such as the size and shape of these birds in the middle of the Amazon, the symbol of terrestrial biodiversity,” ecologist Vitek Jirinec told NBC News. Jirinec was a lead author on the study, which was published in the journal Science Advances on Friday.The paper analyzed measurements and weigh-ins of 77 different bird species since the early 1980s. Nearly all of the bird species have gotten lighter as time goes on. On average, most species became about 2% lighter every decade, which is significant for such small creatures.“These birds don’t vary that much in size,” co-author Philip Stouffer, a professor of conservation biology at Louisiana State University, said in a release from the institution. “They are fairly fine-tuned, so when everyone in the population is a couple of grams smaller, it’s significant.”While birds’ bodies have gotten smaller over time, their wings have gotten longer. The researchers believe this may be an adaptation to hotter temperatures, since longer wings and a smaller bodies mean that birds have to use less energy to move around, helping them stay cool.“The thing that is the most striking about this to me is that this is in the middle of the most intact tropical rainforest in the world,” Stouffer told NPR.The researchers looked at nonmigratory birds ― birds that live within the confines of the rainforest. And the birds they studied lived in an area untouched by threats like deforestation or other development. The only thing changing much around them was the climate: The wet seasons have become wetter while dry seasons have become more dry, and average temperatures have increased in both.The researchers found that bird species living in higher parts of the forest ― as opposed to closer to the forest floor — saw the biggest changes in terms of body composition. That supports the idea that a changing climate is the cause, since those are the species most exposed to heat. They’re also the species that fly the most, meaning that conserving energy while doing so would be the most important for them.This isn’t the only study to suggest that climate change has played a role in animals getting smaller. A 2019 study led by University of Michigan researchers analyzed the average sizes of 52 species of migratory birds in North America from 1978 to 2016. All of them had smaller bodies and longer wings in 2016.And a study published earlier this year found that critically endangered North Atlantic right whales are, on average, about 3 feet shorter than they were 20 years ago. Scientists attributed this to stress caused by myriad human-related causes — among them anthropogenic climate change, which has forced the whales to swim farther north to reach their cold-water prey."}, {"title": "Nearly 200 Nations Reach Watered-Down Climate Agreement At COP26", "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Almost 200 nations accepted a compromise deal Saturday aimed at keeping a key global warming target alive, but it contained a last-minute change that watered down crucial language about coal.Several countries, including small island states, said they were deeply disappointed by the change promoted by India to “phase down,” rather than “phase out” coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.“Our fragile planet is hanging by a thread,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.”Nation after nation had complained earlier on the final day of two weeks of U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, about how the deal did not go far or fast enough, but they said it was better than nothing and provided incremental progress, if not success.In the end, the summit broke ground by singling out coal, however weakly, by setting the rules for international trading of carbon credits, and by telling big polluters to come back next year with improved pledges for cutting emissions.But domestic priorities both political and economic again kept nations from committing to the fast, big cuts that scientists say are needed to keep warming below dangerous levels that would produce extreme weather and rising seas capable of erasing some island nations.Ahead of the Glasgow talks, the United Nations had set three criteria for success, and none of them were achieved. The U.N.’s criteria included pledges to cut carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030, $100 billion in financial aid from rich nations to poor, and ensuring that half of that money went to helping the developing world adapt to the worst effects of climate change.“We did not achieve these goals at this conference,” Guterres said. “But we have some building blocks for progress.”Negotiators from Switzerland and Mexico called the coal language change against the rules because it came so late. However, they said they had no choice but to hold their noses and go along with it.Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said the change will make it harder to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times ― the more stringent threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement.Many other nations and climate campaigners criticized India for making demands that weakened the final agreement.“India’s last-minute change to the language to phase down but not phase out coal is quite shocking,” said Australian climate scientist Bill Hare, who tracks world emission pledges for the science-based Climate Action Tracker. “India has long been a blocker on climate action, but I have never seen it done so publicly.”Others approached the deal from a more positive perspective. In addition to the revised coal language, the Glasgow Climate Pact included enough financial incentives to almost satisfy poorer nations and solved a long-standing problem to pave the way for carbon trading.The agreement also says big carbon-polluting nations have to come back and submit stronger emission cutting pledges by the end of 2022.“It’s a good deal for the world,” U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told The Associated Press. “It’s got a few problems, but it’s all in all a very good deal.”Before the India change, negotiators said the deal preserved, albeit barely, the overarching goal of limiting Earth’s warming by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to preindustrial times.Negotiators Saturday used the word “progress” more than 20 times, but rarely used the word “success” and then mostly in that they’ve reached a conclusion, not about the details in the agreement. Conference President Alok Sharma said the deal drives “progress on coal, cars, cash and trees’’ and is “something meaningful for our people and our planet.’’Environmental activists were measured in their not-quite-glowing assessments, issued before India’s last minute change.“It’s meek, it’s weak, and the 1.5 C goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters,” said Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan, a veteran of the U.N. climate talks known as the Conferences of Parties.Former Irish President Mary Robinson, speaking for a group of retired leaders called The Elders, said the pact represents: “some progress, but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster ... People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty.”Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav argued against a provision on phasing out coal, saying that developing countries were “entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels.”Yadav blamed “unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns” in rich countries for causing global warming.After Yadav first raised the specter of changing the coal language, a frustrated European Union Vice President Frans Timmermans, the 27-nation E.U.’s climate envoy, begged negotiators to be united for future generations.“For heaven’s sake, don’t kill this moment,” Timmermans pleaded. “Please embrace this text so that we bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren.”Helen Mountford, vice president of the World Resources Institute think tank, said India’s demand may not matter as much as feared because the economics of cheaper, renewable fuel is making coal increasingly obsolete.“Coal is dead. Coal is being phased out,” Mountford said. “It’s a shame that they watered it down.’’Kerry and several other negotiators noted that good compromises leave everyone slightly unsatisfied.“Not everyone in public life...gets to make choices about life and death. Not everyone gets to make choices that actually affect an entire planet. We here are privileged today to do exactly that,” he said.Before the coal change, small island nations that are vulnerable to catastrophic effects of climate change and had pushed for bolder actions in Glasgow said they were satisfied with the spirit of compromise, if not the outcome of the talks.“Maldives accepts the incremental progress made in Glasgow,” Aminath Shauna, the island nation’s minister for environment, climate change and technology said. “I’d like to note that this progress is not in line with the urgency and scale with the problem at hand.’’Shauna pointed out that that to stay within warming limit that nations agreed to six years ago in Paris, the world must cut carbon dioxide emissions essentially in half in 98 months. The developing word needs the rich world to step up she said.“The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us,” Shauna said. “We didn’t cause the climate crisis. No matter what we do, it won’t reverse this.”Next year’s talks are scheduled to take place in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.

No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period. Ends.”Environmental advocates say Biden is breaking that pledge now as the administration prepares to hold the largest offshore oil and gas lease sale in U.S. history on Nov. 17.The sale comes on the heels of COP26, the United Nations climate talks in Scotland, where diplomats are on track to strike a deal that falls far short of what scientists say is necessary to avert catastrophic warming. The Department of the Interior will offer up more than 80 million acres — an area larger than the state of New Mexico — of the Gulf of Mexico for drilling. It is bigger than any lease sale conducted under President Donald Trump’s fossil-fuel-friendly administration, and Interior estimates it will lead to the production of an additional 1.1 billion barrels of oil and 4.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over several decades.The administration argues its hands are tied, following the June decision by a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana to strike down Biden’s executive order temporarily pausing new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters.“The administration has made clear that it disagrees with the ruling and the Department of Justice has appealed it, but the government must comply with it in the meantime,” White House spokesman Vedant Patel said in an email statement, noting that Interior previously canceled the pending lease sale.The injunction stemmed from a lawsuit brought by 14 Republican attorneys against the administration. The judge’s opinion relied in part on a study of the leasing pause’s potential economic impacts, which an industry trade group helped shape and that multiple independent researchers dismissed.Legal experts HuffPost interviewed said Biden and his team have some avenues to scale back, delay or cancel the sale, but that they’d come with legal and political risks the administration may be unwilling to take.Sam Kalen, a natural resources law professor at the University of Wyoming, called the Louisiana judge’s ruling as it pertains to offshore leasing “quite questionable.” If a non-governmental organization were to file a complaint seeking to enjoin the upcoming Gulf sale on legitimate grounds — for example, a faulty environmental analysis — then the administration could opt to postpone the auction pending a resolution in court, he said.Drew Caputo, an attorney with environmental group Earthjustice, said the Biden administration could have gone further than simply appealing the judge’s ruling by requesting the appeals court stay, or suspend, the order while the administration argues its case in court.Additionally, Caputo said, it could have declared the sale illegal under the National Environmental Policy Act due to its future climate impacts or used its authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to withdraw large offshore areas from future leasing, much like the Obama administration did with Arctic and Atlantic waters in 2016.“I’m not saying there wouldn’t be legal and political consequences of taking any of these steps. I assume that the industry and their political allies would sue instantly,” Caputo said. “But we have an unbroken, scientific consensus that we are out of time to take action to deal with climate change. Given the fact that 25% of U.S. carbon emissions come from federal oil, gas and coal, there is no way the U.S. can meet its climate obligations by continuing to operate the program with business as usual. And that’s what proceeding with this lease sale does.”Earthjustice sued the administration in September in an attempt to block the Gulf lease sale.In a letter last week, Earthjustice and more than 250 other organizations called on Biden to cancel the Gulf auction amid what Biden himself has warned is a “code red” moment on climate.Going through with it, the groups said, would “make a mockery” of his own commitments on a global stage at the COP26 climate conference this month.“There is still time to keep your promise to end new leases on public lands and waters and address environmental racism,” reads the letter, spearheaded by environmental organization Friends of the Earth. “Please utilize your existing authority and defer Lease Sale 257 to reckon with the latest evidence and properly estimate and acknowledge the full range of impacts from lease sales in this region.”Interior is also moving ahead with onshore oil and gas auctions early next year across some 700,000 acres in multiple Western states, including Wyoming and Colorado, although the Bureau of Land Management recently announced it will for the first time begin analyzing greenhouse gas emissions and weighing the climate impacts of proposed leases — a move that could ultimately result in leases being scaled back or canceled.Many advocates have grown increasingly frustrated with what they see as a disconnect between Biden’s words and actions on climate.During a keynote speech at the U.N. climate summit, Biden described the next 10 years as “a decisive decade” and assured world leaders that the U.S. will once again lead the global effort to confront the climate threat. But with gasoline prices soaring, the administration has asked foreign nations to boost fossil fuel production — a move that Biden acknowledged “​​seems like an irony.”“It does, on the surface, seem inconsistent,” Biden said at the Group of 20 summit on Oct. 31 before heading to COP26. “But it’s not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we’d be in a position — or even next year — that we’re not going to use any more oil or gas; that we’re not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels.”John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy and lead COP26 negotiator, echoed that position.“If [Biden] were asking them to boost their production over five years, I’d quit,” Kerry said at the G20 summit. “But he’s not. He’s asking them to boost production in this immediate moment.”It remains to be seen what sort of interest the upcoming sale will generate. But any new leasing at home is all but certain to lock in domestic production for years to come. Acres sold during next week’s Gulf auction, for example, likely wouldn’t be developed for five or 10 years.“Claiming that we’re only taking short term action to foster oil and gas production while we make the transition on the one hand, and on the other hand selling a carbon bomb of a lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico that can’t go to production for close to 10 years — there’s no way to square that circle,” Caputo said. “It really points out the inconsistency between the federal oil and gas program today and the climate needs of America and the world.”The administration has set a goal of slashing U.S. carbon emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and achieving net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Congress is currently negotiating the president’s Build Back Better plan, which includes an historic $555 billion in climate spending.Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado Boulder, said he’s sympathetic to the concerns of environmentalists who want to see the Biden administration stop fossil fuel development on public lands and waters. But in light of the Louisiana court ruling, he said, there should be a greater focus on limiting development overall, both on federal and private land, and ensuring that all future drilling and mining is done in an environmentally responsible manner.“Just because you’re stopping leasing on federal land doesn’t mean you’re stopping development on federal land, because so much land has already been leased,” Squillace said. “I think there needs to be a more holistic policy with respect to how oil and gas development occurs throughout the country.”The industry has stockpiled enough federal leases and permits to continue drilling on public lands and waters for decades. Shortly after Biden took office, the Interior Department launched a review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who has described the program as “fundamentally broken,” said in May that the public could expect an interim report to come out this summer. Months later, it remains under wraps.“Even without the report, we know what needs to happen,” she told reporters earlier this month, according to E&E News. “We are doing whatever we can at the department to ensure we are analyzing these leases with climate change as a backdrop. We need to absolutely consider climate change, we need to consider the social cost of carbon in the things that we do.”If the administration follows through with the Gulf lease — there is no indication that it won’t — it is certain to face heavy backlash from environmental and climate advocates.“When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging,” Caputo said. “We’re in a fossil fuel leasing hole, so the first thing to do is stop new leasing.”"}, {"title": "Climate Conference Reverses Course On Call To End Coal Use", "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Negotiators at this year’s U.N. climate talks in Glasgow appeared to be backing away from a call to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely, but gave poor countries hope for more financial support to cope with global warming.The latest draft proposals from the meeting’s chair released Friday call on countries to accelerate “the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.”A previous proposal Wednesday had been stronger, calling on countries to “accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel.”While the chair’s proposal is likely to undergo further negotiation at the talks, due to end Friday, the change in wording suggested a shift away from unconditional demands that some fossil fuel exporting nations have objected to.There was a mixed response from observers at the talks on how significant the addition of the words “unabated” and “inefficient” was.“Those qualifiers completely undermine the intention,” said Alex Rafalowicz, director of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Intiative, an environmental campaign group.“They’re loopholes so large you could drive a lorry through them,” he said, using the British term for a truck.Helen Mountford, a senior climate expert at the World Resources Institute, said allowing countries to determine which subsidies they consider inefficient would water down the agreement.“It definitely weakens it,” she said.Even so, the explicit reference to ending at least some state support for oil, gas and coal offered “a strong hook for phasing out fossil fuels subsidies, so its good to have it in there,” she said.The question of how to address the continued use of fossil fuels responsible for much of global warming has been one of the key sticking points at the two-week talks.Scientists agree it is necessary to end their use as soon as possible to meet the 2015 Paris accord’s ambitious goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). But explicitly including such a call in the overarching declaration is politically sensitive, including for countries, such as Saudi Arabia, that fear oil and gas may be targeted next.Another crunch issue is the question of financial aid for poor countries to cope with climate change. Rich nations failed to provide them with $100 billion annually by 2020, as agreed, causing considerable anger among developing countries going into the talks.The latest draft reflects those concerns, expressing “deep regret” that the $100 billion goal hasn’t been met and urging rich countries to scale up their funding.It also adds wording that could create a fund to compensate countries for serious destruction resulting from climate change. Rich nations such as the United States, who have historically been the biggest source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, are opposed to any legal obligation to pay for loss and damage suffered by poor countries.Negotiators from almost 200 nations gathered in Glasgow on Oct. 31 amid dire warnings from leaders, activists and scientists that not enough is being done to curb global warming.According to the proposed decision, countries plan to express “alarm and utmost concern” that human activities have already caused around 1.1C (2F) of global warming “and that impacts are already being felt in every region.”While the Paris accord calls for limiting temperature to “well below” 2C (3.6F), ideally no more than 1.5C, by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times, the draft agreement notes that the lower threshold “would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change” and resolves to aim for that target.In doing so, it calls for the world to cut carbon dioxide emission by 45% in 2030 compared with 2010 levels, and to add no additional CO2 to the atmosphere by mid-century. So far the world is not on track for that, and developed countries are expected to be asked to submit more ambitious targets for cutting emissions next year.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told The Associated Press this week that the 1.5C-goal “is still in reach but on life support.”If negotiators are unable to reach agreement by Friday’s official deadline, it is likely the talks will go into overtime. This has happened at many of the previous 25 meetings as consensus from all 197 countries is required to pass decisions."}, {"title": "Beloved 'Dolphin Tale' Star Winter Dies At Florida Aquarium", "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — A prosthetic-tailed dolphin named Winter that starred in the “Dolphin Tale” movies died Thursday evening at a Florida aquarium despite life-saving efforts to treat a gastrointestinal abnormality, aquarium officials said.The 16-year-old female bottlenose dolphin died while being held by animal care experts who were preparing Winter for a procedure at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium where the famous marine mammal has long resided.“While we are heartbroken by Winter’s death, we are comforted knowing that our team did everything possible to give her the best chance at survival,” said veterinarian Dr. Shelly Marquardt, in a statement released by the aquarium.Marquardt said the aquarium worked with specialists and marine mammal experts from around the country but the dolphin, which was in critical condition and declining, died while being held by caregivers.The statement said the aquarium would remain closed on Friday to provide staff time to grieve. It had earlier said a Friday closure would allow workers to focus on the dolphin’s medical care with plans to reopen Saturday.James “Buddy” Powell, president of the aquarium, told reporters Thursday that the facility’s staff and outside experts were doing everything possible seeking to restore the dolphin to health.Winter previously experienced intestinal issues — not uncommon among dolphins — but such problems have never affected her like this, Powell had said Thursday. But at the time, he said Winter was not responding to treatment as in the past, adding there was no evidence Winter had the coronavirus.Winter was two months old when her tail became entangled in a crab trap near Cape Canaveral, which forced its amputation. “Dolphin Tale,” which was released in 2011, chronicled Winter’s recovery and the unprecedented, lengthy effort to fit her with a prosthetic tail.The film, starring Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson, Morgan Freeman and Nathan Gamble, was largely shot at the Clearwater aquarium and surrounding Tampa Bay locations. It put the non-profit aquarium, first opened in 1972 on the site of a former water treatment plant, on the map internationally.“This place wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Winter,” Powell said.Winter’s story of rehabilitation has become an inspiration for disabled people around the world and the aquarium has received thousands of messages of support since Winter’s illness became known.“Many are inspired by her resiliency and this amazing response reminds us of how deeply she has affected millions, including so many on their own health journey,” the aquarium statement said.A sequel, “Dolphin Tale 2,” was released three years later starring Winter and Hope, another rescued dolphin cared for by the Clearwater aquarium.Bottlenose dolphins can live up to 60 years and are considered one of the most intelligent of all animal species.Winter and Hope became the most famous residents of the Clearwater aquarium, which also operates sea turtle and manatee rescue programs.An $80 million expansion of the facility was recently completed, including a 1.5 million-gallon (5.6 million-liter) new dolphin complex, to handle the crowds that have descended on the aquarium since “Dolphin Tale” was released a decade ago."}, {"title": "Illness Of 'Dolphin Tale' Star Prompts Florida Aquarium To Close 1 Day", "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla.

Sometimes they scramble around the colony to find the right home. This one might have gotten pushed out by other ferrets and it went looking for a new home. We really don’t know.”Schmal said CPW has only received one other report of a black-footed ferret leaving the ranch, and he had never heard of one entering a structure like a garage.“This is extremely rare,” he said. “Black-footed ferrets are nocturnal and extremely shy. For some reason, this one left the colony and was seeking shelter. We’re just glad it appeared healthy, not starving or sick, and we were able to capture it and return it to the colony.”Black-footed ferrets rely heavily on prairie dogs, which are often treated as pests by farmers, for food. The extermination of prairie dogs in the 1900s led to the severe decline of the black-footed ferret population."}, {"title": "Judge OKs $626 Million Settlement In Flint Water Litigation", "text": "DETROIT (AP) — A judge on Wednesday approved a $626 million settlement for Flint residents and others who were exposed to lead-contaminated water.Most of the money — $600 million — is coming from the state of Michigan, which was accused of repeatedly overlooking the devastating risks of switching Flint’s water source in 2014 without treating the water to prevent contamination.“The settlement reached here is a remarkable achievement for many reasons, not the least of which is that it sets forth a comprehensive compensation program and timeline that is consistent for every qualifying participant,” U.S. District Judge Judith Levy said.The settlement was announced in August 2020 by Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, both Democrats, who were elected in 2018 while the litigation was pending.Flint managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder and regulators in his administration allowed the city to use the Flint River in 2014-15 without treating the water to reduce corrosion. As a result, lead in old pipes broke off and flowed through taps.The deal makes money available to every Flint child who was exposed to the water, every adult who can show an injury, certain business owners and anyone who paid water bills.Flint switched back to a Detroit regional water agency in fall 2015 after Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha publicly reported elevated lead levels in children.Attorneys have been seeking as much as $200 million in legal fees from the $626 million settlement."}, {"title": "5 Things To Know About The Potential New Climate Agreement In Glasgow", "text": "The United Nations climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, are on pace to conclude in two days with an agreement that, despite acknowledging the scope and cause of the climate crisis, appears set to fall far short in bending the emissions curve.The draft agreement released early Wednesday made history as the first formal pact to explicitly mention fossil fuels as a source of climate-changing pollution after more than a quarter-century of these summits.The document calls upon signatories “to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels” and asks them to hasten plans to cut climate-changing emissions in hopes of keeping global temperatures from climbing 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond pre-industrial averages.But the draft pact fails to muster the $100 billion per year in financing developing countries need to fortify themselves against climate damages and lift their populations out of poverty without tapping all their available fossil fuel resources. And while it sets a faster timeline for nations to up their ambition, it provides no real way to enforce that process.The language could, in theory, be strengthened before it is ratified. But it’s more likely to be watered down as negotiators seek to settle on something more than 200 countries ― including oil-pumping Saudi Arabia, coal-digging Australia, and the gas-drilling U.S. ― can sign.Here are some things to know about the draft pact:The 2015 Paris Agreement made history as the first to include the United States and China ― the world’s No. 1 cumulative emitter and No. 1 annual emitter, respectively ― in a pact that acknowledged the crisis of spewing carbon into the atmosphere and agreed to reduce the output. But the agreement did so without ever naming fossil fuels, the primary source of CO2 pollution.The 19th of 71 bullet points in the draft agreement “calls upon Parties to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.”If that counts as a breakthrough, it’s only because of how successful the fossil fuel industry’s efforts to sow doubt over the long-understood relationship between burning oil, coal and gas and rising global temperatures.As Harvard University researcher Geoffrey Supran pointed out, Exxon Mobil Corporation’s own scientists acknowledged in a 1982 internal memo that “mitigation of greenhouse effect would require major reductions in fossil fuel combustion.”The planet is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in the early 1700s, before factories, power plants, automobiles and airplanes started belching carbon into the atmosphere. The signs of that warming are evident in increasingly extreme weather, prolonged droughts and shorelines disappearing into the sea. If temperatures rise another 1.5 degrees Celsius, those effects are projected to become far worse.In 2015, campaigners in Paris chanted the slogan “1.5 to stay alive” to highlight the reality that another half-degree of warming threatened to damn low-lying island nations to an Atlantis fate and render desert countries close to the equator uninhabitable. Today, activists are just trying to stoke hope for maintaining that goal with the new chant: “Keep 1.5 alive.”They have their work cut out for them. An analysis published Tuesday by the nonprofit Climate Action Tracker found that countries’ current emissions-cutting pledges have set a course for the planet to warm another 2.4 degrees Celsius. That would blow past even the Paris Agreement’s less ambitious goal of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius.Still, the draft agreement “affirms the long-term global goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.”That alone doesn’t offer much to vulnerable countries, but it goes on to recognize “that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 °C compared to 2 °C and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C, recognizing that this requires meaningful and effective action by all Parties in this critical decade on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge.”The draft also heeds the reality that “limiting global warming to 1.5 °C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century.”The Paris Agreement asks signatories to reassess and ratchet up their emissions-cutting plans every five years. This year’s conference was so important because it marked the first scheduled five-year ramp up. (Technically, it’s six years later, but last year’s summit was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)This agreement looks unlikely to accomplish that goal. But the draft calls on countries to submit new, more ambitious plans next year and to prepare proposals that comply with the 1.5-degree goal by 2023.At the 2018 summit in Katowice, Poland, negotiators agreed to most of what became known as the “Paris rulebook” ― a set of standards for countries to adhere to the Paris Agreement’s goals. But one section remained an open question: Article 6, a complex portion that aims to set up a trading system that would allow countries to exchange rights to spew pollution into the atmosphere.In theory, a carbon market would make countries that cannot avoid pollution pay a price, and nations that can absorb carbon through lush forests or technological investments reap a reward. But that sort of system of exchange fails to reckon with the fact that CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, meaning that countries such as the U.S., Britain and Norway bear far more responsibility for the present crisis than nations whose emissions are still growing, such as India, Indonesia and Tanzania.Advocates say Article 6 is a distraction from the more difficult work of simply reducing emissions. Statements from the fossil fuel industry have only increased that perception. In 2018, an executive from Royal Dutch Shell boasted about helping to write Article 6: “We have had a process running for four years for the need of carbon unit trading to be part of the Paris Agreement.”“Carbon markets provide cover for empty greenwashing schemes, and are thus a way to distract from the real action people and the planet need, urgently,” said Rachel Rose Jackson, the climate research and policy director at the watchdog Corporate Accountability, over email Wednesday. “Article 6 is one of the battlegrounds where we are seeing the interests of polluting countries and corporations be pitted against the people’s and the planet’s.”While the agreement is the main event in Glasgow, the gathering has yielded some other significant pledges. More than 100 countries signed a pledge to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of this decade ― though there’s reason to doubt its effectiveness.Nearly as many countries signed the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions of the super-heating greenhouse gas at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. And the U.S. and about two dozen other nations joined an effort to halt public financing for fossil fuel projects overseas, while the United Kingdom wrangled another two dozen countries into an agreement to stop the buildout of coal ― a goal that, while long expected, looks slightly out of reach during a year when coal use surged in response to a global energy crisis.Perhaps most notable was a pledge from six automakers and more than two dozen countries to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles no later than 2040. The promise is in line with what France and the state of California have already mandated and has credibility thanks to soaring sales of electric vehicles. But big automakers, in particular, have made 180s on climate promises before."}, {"title": "Environmental Consulting Firm Double Dips On U.S. Methane Fight", "text": "An energy consulting firm with ties to several major environmental groups also represented a group of large oil producers as they sought to shape the Biden administration’s new methane emission rules.In June, Massachusetts-based consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates published an analysis that ranked the oil and gas industry’s largest emitters of methane and other greenhouse gases. The environmental group Clean Air Task Force and investor-focused climate nonprofit Ceres commissioned the report, which found that in 2019 the nation’s top 100 oil and gas producers accounted for nearly 80% of the industry’s total reported emissions of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, and other warming pollutants.“As our report shows, it’s the Wild West right now, with dramatic differences between companies when it comes to methane emissions and emissions intensity,” Sarah Smith, director of the Super Pollutants Program at the Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement at the time. “We need strong, sensible regulation of the oil and gas industry if we’re to have any hope of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius and staving off the worst impacts of climate change.”The report’s authors hoped the findings would “inform regulators, lawmakers and even company executives themselves, particularly as the EPA prepares to revise federal methane regulations this fall,” CATF and Ceres noted in a release.But a few months earlier, MJB&A had represented a group of oil and gas producers in a meeting with high-level government officials to discuss upcoming methane regulations, according to emails and calendars that the watchdog group Documented obtained and shared with HuffPost.Five of MJB&A’s fossil fuel clients are among the industry’s highest methane emitters, according to the firm’s own analysis: ConocoPhillips, BP, Shell, Pioneer Natural Resources and Equinor. ConocoPhillips and BP rank among the industry’s top 10 greenhouse gas emitters.The documents show MJB&A is “happy to play both sides,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior investigator at Documented.In late March, MJB&A’s founder and president, Michael Bradley, emailed Environmental Protection Agency Deputy Assistant Administrator Tomás Carbonell to request a sit-down on behalf of his industry clients.“MJB&A has recently agreed to manage a collaborative process between several oil and gas companies focused on the anticipated EPA proposed methane regulation,” Bradley wrote. “These companies include ConocoPhillips, BP, Shell and Pioneer. Equinor and Oxy may also decide to participate in the future. The companies are looking to play a constructive role in the development of the methane rule for the oil and gas sector.”EPA staff met with Bradley, two of his MJB&A colleagues and representatives of all six oil and gas producers on April 8, calendars show. Ahead of that meeting, Bradley sent agency officials a list of priority questions related to the looming methane rules, including whether the agency was considering any other policy pathways to reduce industry emissions and what industry data would be helpful to the agency as it worked to develop regulations.A Shell white paper from May offers clues about how the industry sought to shape the rules. Above all else, the rules should reduce methane emissions “in a manner that is flexible and cost-efficient,” Shell wrote.Robert LaCount, executive vice president of MJB&A and lead author of the CATF-Ceres report, told HuffPost his company “works with clients in the energy sector to respond to the challenges associated with climate change,” and that mitigating methane emissions from oil and gas operations is one of the firm’s specific focus areas.The April meeting, he said, was organized on behalf of one industry client — he did not disclose which — “who asked us to help facilitate a discussion with EPA on the use of advanced technologies to detect fugitive methane emissions.”“We’ve worked with many clients to advance approaches to better detect, quantify, reduce and report on methane emissions,” LaCount said. “We perform this work through engagements with individual organizations and through multi-stakeholder initiatives. Our energy sector clients are aware that we have environmental NGOs as clients and our environmental NGO clients are aware we have energy sector companies as clients.”The documents, unearthed via public records requests, shine a light on a little-known consulting firm whose clientele includes organizations fighting for stricter climate regulations and the industry that stands to be most impacted by them. MJB&A represents a variety of energy companies, green groups and other organizations. International consulting firm Environmental Resources Management acquired MJB&A last year.The Clean Air Task Force and Ceres told HuffPost they’ve both worked with MJB&A for years, and noted that the report was compiled from publicly available data reported to the EPA.“It was intended to put social license pressure on companies to reduce their emissions by grading their performance,” said CATF’s Smith.Smith said her organization selected MJB&A to conduct the emissions analysis because it has “excellent analysts” who are familiar with the oil and gas industry and its emissions.“But, moreover, because [MJB&A] is well-known to the oil and gas industry, we saw them as a consulting firm that the companies know and whose analysis they trust, so that they could not ignore or quibble with the findings of the report,” Smith said.Mara Abbott, a communications manager at Ceres, said via email that it is not uncommon for consulting firms to have clients across multiple industries.“So while we rarely know the full scope of a consultant’s client base, most consulting, economic, accounting and law firms have a wide range of clients,” she said via email. “We have chosen to work with M.J. Bradley over the years, as they have been leaders in their space — working with utility companies and others to provide expertise to move those companies to proactively address mercury, methane, and carbon emissions and to get those companies to be vocal on policy and regulatory changes.”Banks, public relations firms, advertising agencies, universities and foundations are facing mounting pressure to cut ties with fossil fuel interests amid rapidly worsening climate change. Consulting firms are an emerging battlefront in that campaign. Last month, The New York Times reported on an internal “revolt” at consulting giant McKinsey & Company over the company’s extensive business with dozens of the world’s biggest corporate polluters.“We’ve seen a massive shift in public opposition against Big Oil and Gas’s deadly lies — and rightly so,” Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at the climate advocacy group Oil Change International, told HuffPost via email. “Corporations like Shell and BP are working overtime to preserve their business model that’s wrecking the planet, and anyone taking blood money to help them do so is culpable.”Rees added that the institutional fossil fuel divestment push has been “a massive success,” and that there is an increasing focus on pushing advertising and communications firms to break ties as well. A report published last week estimates that nearly $40 trillion in global assets have been divested.“Management consultants like M.J. Bradley need to see the writing on the wall and get out now — if they don’t, they’ll go down in history as the last gasp of a dying, deadly fossil fuel era,” Rees said.The Biden administration unveiled its sweeping new methane rules this month, which aim to rein in methane emissions from existing oil and gas wells and require stringent monitoring for leaks. Methane, the second most common greenhouse gas, has been described as “CO2 on steroids” for its warming capabilities. Over a 20-year period in the atmosphere, methane is at least 86 times more potent than CO2.Several large oil companies, including Shell and BP, have voiced support for federal methane regulations and opposed the Trump administration’s effort to dismantle Obama-era rules. But the industry’s largest trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, has a long history of working to block and weaken methane regulations. In response to the Biden administration rules, API said it “supports the direct regulation of methane” and “will continue working with [EPA] to help shape a final rule that is effective, feasible and designed to encourage further innovation.”MJB&A’s parent company, ERM, touts itself as “a global pure-play sustainability consultancy with deep sectoral, technical and business expertise in the low-carbon energy transition.” But its historical ties to the tobacco industry and ongoing business with fossil fuel interests have drawn heavy criticism. ERM has a number of major fossil fuel clients, including Chevron, Shell and Total, and is a member of the American Petroleum Institute, which spent decades sowing doubt about human-caused climate change.ERM wrote the environmental assessment for TransCanada’s controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, which Grist reported “estimates, and then dismisses, the pipeline’s massive carbon footprint and other environmental impacts, because, it asserts, the mining and burning of the tar sands is unstoppable.”MJB&A did not respond to several of HuffPost’s specific questions, including whether it is expanding its business with fossil fuel interests. The company advertises many of its clients online; none of drilling companies it represented during the April meeting with EPA are listed.Earlier this year, the firm added BP as a registered lobbying client. The company also pays Nichole Distefano, a former Obama EPA official and current attorney at K Street powerhouse Mehlman Castegnetti Rosen & Thomas, to lobby on its behalf on energy and environmental issues. In early March, Distefano and one of her industry clients, oil and gas trade group American Exploration & Production Council (AXPC), had their own meeting with EPA officials to discuss methane, according to agency calendars. MJB&A’s clients ConocoPhillips and Pioneer are members of AXPC.AXPC often teams up with the Independent Petroleum Association of America, an industry trade association with a record of anti-climate lobbying, to write letters to members of Congress and weigh in on regulatory proposals. In comments submitted to EPA in July on the upcoming methane rule, IPAA challenged the findings of the methane emissions analysis that MJB&A conducted for Ceres and the Clean Air Task Force. The industry group claimed that the report is part of a broader effort by environmental groups to “tar low production wells and the small businesses that operate them.”IPAA guards its membership, but a partial list that the nonprofit Western Values Project obtained in 2018 shows that AXPC, Shell and Pioneer are all members of the organization."}, {"title": "Lobster Caught In Maine Is Insanely Rare And She's A Beauty", "text": "A blue and pink lobster known as a cotton candy lobster has clawed its way into crustacean lore. (See the images below.)Caught in Maine’s Casco Bay on Friday, the gorgeous creature is so rare that one turns up only about every four to five years, according to National Geographic. Only 1 in every 100 million lobsters has the pastel coloring, home delivery company Get Maine Lobster said.Bill Coppersmith, a professional lobsterman, told Boston.com that he noticed a “strange color in the trap.”“I didn’t know if it was a toy lobster or what the heck it was,” he said.Haddie, named for Coppersmith’s granddaughter, won’t be taking a dip in drawn butter.

The power and heating outages resulted in hundreds of deaths, both directly from freezing and from related causes, like a lack of access to needed medical care.Warford blames the Railroad Commission for failing to actually regulate the state’s enormous fossil fuel sector after an icy winter storm in 2011 prompted outages.Refusing to invest in weatherization is often more profitable for energy producers because they can charge higher prices if a weather event constrains supply, according to Warford. That, in turn, motivates industry-friendly commissioners to go easy on energy producers who want to spend as little money as possible on weatherization.The commissioners “didn’t hold companies accountable,” Warford said. “They didn’t regulate and do what they’re supposed to do.”In addition, Warford blames the Railroad Commission for failing to limit methane emissions generated during the extraction of oil and gas in the state. Over a 20-year period, methane is 84-86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, making it a major contributor to global climate change.Methane sometimes leaks from oil and gas equipment that is not properly sealed. At other times, oil producers engage in controlled releases of excess natural gas through practices known as “flaring” and “venting” that often result in unnecessary methane emissions.Methane emissions are particularly significant in the Permian Basin shale oilfield in West Texas, according to Environmental Defense Fund measurements. And much of the flaring there is happening without the necessary permits from the Texas Railroad Commission. An August report from conservation group Earthworks found that 69-84% of observed flares were not permitted.The commission has regulatory power at its disposal to crack down on methane leaks that “they’re not actually enforcing,” Warford said. “They’re massively understaffed, and they’re not applying the regulation evenly.”“That puts companies following the regulation fundamentally at a disadvantage, because there’s a cost there,” he added.Texas also emits more carbon dioxide than any state in the country. And while promising to respect the ongoing role of fossil fuels in the state’s economy, Warford says he hopes to use his influence to help Texas diversify its energy sources as well.“Oil and gas is definitely the quarterback,” he said. “But on a football team, you don’t want 11 quarterbacks. We also want Texas leadership in wind, solar and geothermal.”If elected, Warford’s power would be limited, since the commission makes decisions based on a majority vote and Warford would be the commission’s only Democrat. What he would have the power to do is use his bully pulpit, including an ability to convene public hearings, to draw attention to decisions with which he disagrees and any conflicts of interest at the commission.Every commissioner serves staggered six-year terms, meaning that a single commission seat comes up for a vote every two years. In an optimistic scenario, a successful use of the commission’s public platform in Warford’s first two years could help Democrats take a second commission seat in 2022. He could also help implement any federal regulations President Joe Biden enacts as part of his plan to cut U.S. emissions in half by 2030.Texas’ primary elections are set to take place on March 1. Warford is the first person to announce his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Wayne Christian’s commission seat.Of course, the hardest part for Warford will be winning the general election in Texas, a state where Democrats have not won a statewide election in 27 years ― to say nothing of doing so in a midterm election cycle when party leaders are already expecting major losses.Texas Democrats made a similar pitch about the importance of the Railroad Commission in 2020 when oil and gas attorney Chrysta Castañeda made a serious run against Jim Wright, a climate-change-denying oil producer who ousted the more moderate incumbent commissioner in a Republican primary.Wright, who has been fined by the Railroad Commission in the past, ended up defeating Castañeda by nine percentage points despite billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s last-minute infusion of $2.6 million on Castañeda’s behalf.Warford nonetheless believes that Texans’ frustrations with the electrical grid failures during February’s storm and a growing understanding of how the commission’s coziness with fossil fuel interests exacerbates climate change give him a fighting chance at the seat.“The grid failing fundamentally changes the calculus around this race,” Warford told HuffPost.Even as Democrats in many states suffer from the effects of “thermostatic politics” ― a political science term for voters demanding the opposite of whatever the governing party is implementing ― Democrats in Texas stand to benefit from being out of power, according to Warford.“In the same way you see national frustration toward people in power, the people in power here for a long time have been Republicans,” he said. “And Texans are frustrated. Texans are looking for something new.”A recent public poll backs up Warford’s political instincts. Sixty percent of Texas voters disapprove of how state lawmakers have handled electric grid reliability, compared with 15% of voters who approve of it, according to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll released in October. The gap between approval and disapproval was greater on that question than on any other in the survey.Warford also hopes to benefit from the enthusiasm unleashed by a yet-to-be-determined field of Democrats seeking to challenge Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who is seeking a third term in office.Rather than point to Castañeda’s 2020 bid as a model, Warford sees lessons to learn from Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried’s 2018 run. In an election cycle when Republicans ousted a Democratic senator and maintained control of Florida’s governorship, Fried won her race on a message of protecting Florida’s waterways, reducing the gun lobby’s influence over concealed-carry permitting, and expanding access to medical marijuana.

The group added that if the group was considered a unified delegation, it would be larger than any sent by an individual country.Some of the lobbyists directly represent companies including Shell, BP and Russia’s Gazprom, while others are indirectly linked to the industry.“The presence of hundreds of those being paid to push the toxic interests of polluting fossil fuel companies, will only increase the skepticism of climate activists who see these talks as more evidence of global leaders’ dithering and delaying,” Murray Worthy, Global Witness’s gas campaign leader, said in a statement. “It’s time for politicians to show they are serious about ending the influence of big polluters over political decision-making and commit to a future where expert and activist voices are given centerstage.”About 40,000 people are in Glasgow for the summit, and each country has sent a bevy of delegates and some star power to the negotiations. The United States sent 165 people, including former President Barack Obama, and the U.K.’s 230 included broadcaster David Attenborough and Prince William.Still, the oil and gas industry has been a regular feature at the climate summits, long arguing that their presence is necessary as the world works to transition away from fossil fuels, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has taken Glasgow by storm, said the news was troubling even if the industry had a smaller effect than usual.“I don’t know about you,” she wrote on Twitter, “but I sure am not comfortable with having some of the world’s biggest villains influencing & dictating the fate of the world.”While key pledges have been made to address methane emissions, limit deforestation and dramatically increase investment in renewable sources, the world has ground to make up if it hopes to avert the worst effects of climate change. The United Nations released a preliminary analysis on Tuesday that found the planet is on track to warm by about 2.5 degrees Celsius even with current commitments, far beyond the 1.5 degrees scientists say is needed to stave off an increase in extreme weather and a massive hit to biodiversity.The report found that unless current pledges to rein in emissions are increased soon, humanity will lose out on the ability to keep the warming level to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.“We are not doing enough. We are not where we need to be,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, told The Washington Post this week. “And we need to step up with much more action, much more urgency and much more ambition.”"}, {"title": "Police Give Up Search For Swimmer In Australia Double Shark Attack", "text": "Perth authorities have called off a search for an experienced swimmer after a double shark attack off a beach in Western Australia.It was unclear from witnesses if Paul Millachip, 57, was attacked by two sharks or attacked twice by the same 14-foot great white shark, according to police. Some witnesses reported seeing two dorsal fins.The father of two, who had moved from London to Perth, was swimming off a beach in North Fremantle when the attack occurred Friday morning. Minutes earlier, a group of teenagers had spotted a great white off the beach and jumped in their dinghy to warn people.They were close to Millachip when he was attacked — and tried in vain to help him.They “witnessed the attack and … provided police with information on what they saw and heard,” Acting Inspector Troy Douglas told Australian Broadcasting Corp. News.He called the teens’ attempt to help Millachip a “fantastic effort” but “probably something you don’t want to see.” They also did a “great job of alerting other people on the beach and other swimmers,” he added.Authorities were attempting to determine if a great white shark circled around to attack Millachip a second time or if the swimmer was also attacked by a tiger shark.The search was call off after only Millachip’s swimming goggles were found.“Inquiries will continue based on anything that is washed up or anything that’s found in the future, but at this point the marine search is suspended,” said Douglas, The Yorkshire Post reported.Millachip’s wife, who asked not to be named, was sitting on the beach when the attack occurred.She offered a “special mention to those young lads in the boat for what they did in what must have been an absolutely terrifying experience for them. My heart goes out to them, and I thank them for what they did,” she told journalists at the beach. (Check out the video above,)They “could potentially have saved other lives,” she added.“Rest in peace, Paul,” she said. “He died [doing] what he enjoyed doing the most. ...

Though there has been progress since the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement “we are nowhere near where we need to be.”His comments came as conference leaders acknowledged Monday that many key sticking points exist after a week of talks.A trust gap between rich and poor nations on climate change issues emerged when the negotiations went through a check of what’s been accomplished and what’s left to be done. Developing countries used versions of the word “disappointing” five times when leaders talked Monday about the progress to date.The U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, is the former American president’s first since he helped deliver the triumph of the 2015 Paris climate accord, when nations committed to cutting fossil fuel and agricultural emissions fast enough to keep the Earth’s warming below catastrophic levels of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).That celebration has faded and been replaced by worry. Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord. President Joe Biden put America back in as soon as he took office this year but U.S. efforts at fighting climate change were set back years by the Trump move.“1.5 C is on life support now, it’s in ICU,” said Alden Meyer, a long-time observer of climate talks with E3G, an environmental think tank.Obama’s appearance on the sidelines of the talks sought to remind governments of the elation that surrounded the Paris accord, and urge them to announce more immediate, concrete steps to put the 2015 deal into action.“The U.S. is back and in moving more boldly. The U.S. is not alone,” Obama said.Obama noted efforts by the United States — the world’s second-worst climate polluter now after China — stalled when Trump pulled out of the climate accord.“I wasn’t real happy about that,” he admitted, but added that optimism is required to save the planet.“There are times where I feel discouraged. There are times where the future seems somewhat bleak. There are times where I am doubtful that humanity can get its act together before it’s too late,” Obama said. “We can’t afford hopelessness.”Despite opposition within Biden’s own Democratic party that has blocked the climate-fighting legislation, Obama said he was confident that some version of Biden’s ambitious climate bill will pass in Congress in the next few weeks.“It will set the United States on course to meet its new climate targets,” he said.And while in 2015, rapport between Obama administration negotiators and their Chinese counterparts was seen as paving the way to the global Paris accord, Obama on Monday criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin for not joining other global leaders at the climate talks in Glasgow.“It was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the world’s largest emitters, China and Russia, decline to even attend the proceedings, and their national plans reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency,” Obama said.Obama spoke earlier Monday to a session on Pacific Island nations, including ones whose existence is threatened by rising oceans under climate change.“All of us have a part to play. All of us have work to do. All of us have sacrifices to make” on climate, he said. “But those of us who live in wealthy nations, those of us who helped to precipitate the problem ... we have an added burden.”When he was briefing the U.N. climate conference (COP26) on the first week’s progress, COP26 President Alok Sharma had to correct himself about the number of issues settled, changing “many” into “some.”No deals have been made yet on three main goals of the U.N. conference. Those are pledges to cut emissions in half by 2030 to keep the Paris climate deal’s 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit goal alive; the need for $100 billion annually in financial help from rich countries to poor ones; and the idea that half of that money goes to adapting to global warming’s worst effects. Several other issues, including trading carbon and transparency, also weren’t solved yet.Numerous developing nations were pessimistic. They called progress “disappointing” and not near enough, saying announcements on fighting climate change were high in quantity but worried that they were low in quantity.Representatives of 77 developing nations, along with China, said until this climate conference fixes the financial pledge problem to help poor nations cope with climate change these talks cannot be successful.Ahmadou Sebory Touré of Guinea, speaking on behalf of poor nations, said rich countries not fulfilling their $100 billion pledge shows those countries are just making “an empty commitment.”“There is a history of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments by developed countries,” Diego Pacheco Balanza of Bolivia told the conference.Scientists say the urgency of global warming is as great as the dire speeches at Glasgow have conveyed, with the planet only a few years away from the point where meeting the goals set in the Paris accord becomes impossible, due to mounting damage from coal, petroleum, agriculture and other pollution sources.The last few days have seen huge protests in Glasgow and around Europe for faster action in fighting global warming.Obama told young people “you are right to be frustrated,” but then relayed the advice his mother gave him when he was young.“Don’t sulk. Get busy, get to work and change what needs to be changed,” he said. “Vote like your life depends on it — because it does.”___Associated Press reporter Aniruddha Ghosal contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Joaquin Phoenix, Billie Eilish Join Call To Send Pardoned Turkeys To Sanctuary", "text": "A flock of celebrities ― including the famously vegan Billie Eilish, Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix ― have added their names to a petition asking President Joe Biden to send this year’s “pardoned” Thanksgiving turkeys to an animal sanctuary.“We have petitioned past presidents to release the pardoned turkeys to one of [our] sanctuaries with no success, so this year we’re hoping that having so many high-profile celebrities also making the request will help bring attention to the issue and help make it happen,” Farm Sanctuary spokesperson Meredith Turner-Smith told HuffPost in an email.The nonprofit runs a sanctuary in New York state and one in California for animals like pigs, cows, chickens, sheep and of course, turkeys. The organization says it can offer a better home than petting zoos or college poultry science departments, where it maintains they are “likely not cared for as individuals with unique personalities, emotions, needs, and preferences.”Celebs who signed on also include Margaret Cho, Ricky Gervais, Natasha Lyonne and Dave Bautista, who recently made headlines after vowing to find the person who abused a puppy before the actor adopted her.What most people now call the “turkey pardon” is technically named the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation, which dates back to 1947 as a ceremony involving the poultry industry giving two turkeys to the presidential family.Sometimes the birds were eaten, and other times presidents or first ladies would send them to farms or children’s attractions. But the modern turkey pardon people recognize today officially started under George H.W. Bush, who in 1989 announced during the presentation that the “fine tom turkey” was “presented a presidential pardon as of right now.”Since then, pardonee destinations have included farms, zoos, educational institutions, George Washington’s Mount Vernon and even Disney World and Disneyland. Their remaining lifespans are often short, with many dying within a few months to a year later. (Though last year’s turkeys, Corn and Cob, are still alive and gobbling at Iowa State University.) A big issue is that modern turkeys are bred to put on a huge amount of weight quickly, which takes a major toll on their health.To help deal with that problem, Farm Sanctuary gives its turkeys a low-fat, high-fiber diet, its president, Gene Baur, told The Atlantic during a prior plea to take the turkeys back in 2009. However, they do get one big cheat day every year when they can cut loose and feast ― Thanksgiving."}, {"title": "Glasgow Climate Marchers To COP26 Coalition: 'We Are Watching You'", "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Cheering and marching to the beat of drums, tens of thousands of climate activists paraded Saturday through the streets of the Scottish city hosting the U.N. climate summit, demanding that governments step up actions to reduce the use of climate-warming fossil fuels that are damaging the planet.The mood in Glasgow was upbeat despite bursts of rain and the crowd was peaceful. Protesters condemned government leaders around the world for climate talks that activists say have so far failed to produce the fast action needed. Climate protests were also held in other cities across Europe, including London, Paris, Dublin, Copenhagen, Zurich and Istanbul.“We’re having these conversations, but there’s no policies to actually back them,” said Daze Aghaji, a marcher from London at the Glasgow demonstration, shouting over the steady beat of the drums.“And on top of that, the real people should be in the room,” Aghaji said, echoing complaints from climate advocates that the Glasgow summit has too sharply limited participation by the public. “How are we expecting to make decent policy when the people who are the stakeholders of this aren’t even present in the room?”Marchers held signs with messages including “Code Red for Humanity,” “Stop big polluters,” “COP26, we are watching you” or simply “I’m angry.”Megan McClellan, 24, of Glasgow said she doubted that climate negotiators were listening: “This is a very easy thing for them to ignore. They’re nice and comfortable” inside the summit conference center.But her friend Lucette Wood, 30, of Edinburgh disagreed.“They might not actually do anything about it but they pretend that they do ... and they will just put it off for 20-30 years,” Wood said.As marchers neared the climate summit, a rainbow arched through the sky.“Overwhelmingly, the protests make a difference,” said Elizabeth May, a Canadian member of parliament and 16-time COP participant who was at the rally. “Most of the people on the inside are here in their hearts and sometimes physically.”Inside the huge U.N. conference venue, negotiators knuckled down for a seventh straight day of talks to finish draft agreements that can be passed to government ministers for political approval next week. Among the issues being haggled over at the talks by almost 200 countries are a fresh commitment to capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), getting countries to review their efforts more frequently to increase the pressure for deeper cuts, and providing more financial support for poor nations to adapt to climate change.The summit’s president, Alok Sharma, told reporters at a news conference he understood protesters’ frustration.“I think we have overall made progress,” Sharma said Saturday. “I think people have been constructive in the negotiating rooms.”“We are getting to the point where the rubber hits the road, where we’re going to have to make, you know, tough decisions” by government officials, he said. “I don’t, certainly do not, underestimate the difficulty of the task which is ahead of us.”A Democratic and Republican delegation of U.S. senators were visiting the summit on Saturday. And British actor Idris Elba brought his star power to the U.N. talks, highlighting the importance of helping small farmers cope with global warming. Elba, known for roles such as the HBO series “The Wire” and BBC One’s “Luther,” said he wanted to highlight the disruption to global food chains as small farmers in particular are hit by erratic seasonal rains, drought and other impacts of climate change.“This conversation around food is something that needs to be really amplified, and one thing I’ve got is a big mouth,” said Elba, adding that 80% of the food consumed worldwide is produced by small-scale farmers.Saturday’s march drew a range of participants and ages, a day after tens of thousands of young people in the Fridays for Future movement protested outside the conference’s steel fences. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 18, on Friday branded the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow “a failure” so far, accusing leaders of purposefully creating loopholes in the rules and giving misleading pictures of their countries’ actual emissions.Thunberg’s mix of school strikes, blunt and impatient talk about government excuses, and mass demonstrations have galvanized climate protests since 2018, especially in Europe.The climate protest movement — and worsening droughts, storms, floods, wildfires and other disasters around the world this year — have brought home to many the accelerating damage of global warming and have kept the pressure on governments for stronger and faster action to reduce fossil fuel emissions.In central London, hundreds of climate protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square. Protester Sue Hampton, 64, said everyone is at risk and all generations need to press for action.“We can’t let the young people do all the work here. We’ve all got to do it together,” she said.In Istanbul, climate protesters brought their children to the demonstration Saturday, emphasizing the impact of global warming on future generations.“I want my children to live on a beautiful planet in the future,” said Kadriye Basut, 52, in Istanbul.Danica Kirka in London, Seth Borenstein in Glasgow and Andrew Wilks in Istanbul contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Oklahoma Proposes Letting Gas Utility Charge A $1,400 ‘Exit Fee’ To Go Electric", "text": "Oklahoma’s biggest natural gas utility could soon charge customers who switch to electric stoves and heating systems an “exit fee” of nearly $1,400 to disconnect service, HuffPost has learned, setting a precedent that could help the industry lock millions of Americans into fossil fuel use for decades.The proposal is part of a larger bid by Oklahoma Natural Gas to sell off debt it incurred when fuel prices skyrocketed during a historic cold snap last February. It is currently being negotiated before a judge at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. The provision, which would apply only to customers who terminate service specifically to go electric, could be approved as early as December and come into force no later than June.The fee could more than double the cost of swapping a gas stove for a new electric appliance, forcing homeowners offloading their last gas appliance to not only purchase the new one but also to bid the utility farewell by paying out the remainder of their share of the company’s debt. The fee is also a flat rate for virtually all customers, so the cost does not reflect the amount of gas the household used during last winter’s deep freeze.If greenlighted, the measure would likely become a model for gas-friendly regulators across the country, advocates say, providing a new tool to prevent consumer transitions from fossil fuels to zero-carbon alternatives. Texas and Kansas are already considering their own proposals, according to one source who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the plans.The Sooner State had already helped pioneer a similar policy when it approved one of the nation’s first “preemption laws” barring its cities and towns from banning new gas hookups in buildings. Oklahoma enacted the legislation last year, shortly after Berkeley, California, became the first U.S. city to require all new construction to go electric.Since then, more than 20 states, most of them Republican-controlled, have passed similar laws banning bans on natural gas, while cities including San Francisco, Seattle and Brookline, Massachusetts, have barred new or renovated buildings from installing gas appliances. The effort comes as cities and states rush to cut climate-changing pollution, roughly 13% of which in the U.S. comes from buildings. Electrification poses an existential threat to gas utilities, which have responded with aggressive lobbying for preemption laws and with misleading advertising campaigns featuring Instagram influencers.“Exit fees are just one more example of barriers being put in place to make it more difficult for customers to electrify their homes and cut greenhouse gases,” said Charlie Spatz, a researcher who tracks preemption laws at the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute. “As gas prices rise and consumers are more concerned about their carbon footprints, this exit fee could become a serious financial hurdle locking customers into the gas system.”Unlike the state’s preemption law, which Oklahoma Natural Gas lobbied for, the utility serving roughly 90% of the state did not initially request the exit fee. The issue stems from the brutal winter storm that sent temperatures in Oklahoma, Texas and neighboring states plummeting below freezing for two weeks last February. Across the region, gas pipelines froze just as ratepayers were cranking up their heat while power plants were also using more natural gas to meet soaring electricity demand. With demand high and supply low, the price of natural gas spiked. To cover the cost of buying fuel, Oklahoma Natural Gas brokered a hasty deal to borrow $1.5 billion from Bank of America.The utility, owned by the publicly traded $4 billion giant ONE Gas, did not want that debt on its books, where it could incur extra fees and affect the company’s credit rating. Oklahoma Natural Gas’s allies in the state legislature stepped in to help. While residents were still freezing to death in the state, lawmakers introduced a bill to allow the company to convert its debt to public bonds, a process called securitizing. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the legislation into law in April.Are you an Oklahoma Natural Gas customer? Not sure? If you’re an Oklahoman with a gas stove, chances are you pay bills to ONG. We want to hear what you think about this story.Sooner after, Oklahoma Natural Gas applied to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to propose converting its debt into bonds. Once Wall Street bond buyers purchased the debt, the company asked the state for permission to charge about an extra $8 each month to the vast majority of its ratepayers. The charge and the exit fee would be the same for small customers and large ones, regardless of how much gas they used during the winter storm, and the levies would last for the full 25 years the bonds were in place. Ratepayers’ monthly payments would essentially serve as collateral.But those payments are not guaranteed to continue for that long. Electric stoves and geothermal heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular as technology improves and climate policies provide incentives to make the switch. Concern over global warming is hardly the only motivation. Mounting research indicates that gas stoves produce dangerous amounts of indoor air pollution, and the rising cost of natural gas means going electric is, in many places, simply the cheaper option.This reality puts the future of gas utilities as a business in jeopardy.Fearing that a looming exodus of gas ratepayers would render Oklahoma Natural Gas’s bond debt so risky that the interest rates would become astronomical, a staffer at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Public Utility Division proposed the exit fee.In testimony submitted in the case in response to Oklahoma Natural Gas’s application, Isaac Stroup, a regulatory coordinator at the commission, warned that the growing number of cities banning gas “could lead to natural gas being viewed as more uncertain than electricity, at least over the long term” even though he believed “natural gas in Oklahoma should be viewed differently than natural gas is viewed from a national perspective.” Citing the state’s preemption law, he said the “industry is an integral part of Oklahoma’s economy, and the chances of it being banned in Oklahoma are extremely small.”Still, he said, “with the securitization of costs being recovered over many years, some investors could be concerned about the ability of a natural gas utility to recover the total costs over the life of the bonds.”“This, in turn, could lead to a lower bond rating and therefore higher interest rates.”Oklahoma Natural Gas and its parent company said in the proceedings that it did not oppose the measure.“This fee is intended only as a funds recovery mechanism and not as a hindrance for customers who would seek to leave the natural gas system,” Lizaimee Steger, a spokeswoman for ONE Gas, said in an emailed statement. “The fee is one small part of the securitization process designed to minimize impact to all our customers.”The company is one of just four parties to the case. The other three are the Public Utility Division, which proposed the fee, the state attorney general and retail giant Walmart, which said in a filing that it joined the case as a matter of routine monitoring to assess its interests as a major gas buyer.Oklahoma Corporation Commission spokesperson Matt Skinner declined to comment on the specifics of an ongoing case but said “it is a normal part of the negotiation process” for regulators to propose solutions the companies did not request.Because the exit fee did not appear in Oklahoma Natural Gas’s initial application, environmental groups and consumer watchdogs said they were blindsided and unable to mount an early opposition to the proposal.“This shameful proposal would penalize customers trying to move away from the risky, costly, dirty fuel of fracked gas that caused energy prices to skyrocket and led to this securitization docket in the first place,” Cheyenne Skye Branscum, the chair of the Sierra Club’s Oklahoma chapter, said in a statement. “Trapping ONG customers in a financial vice runs counter to the freedom narrative we regularly hear from fossil fuel utilities and corporations.”Amy Turner, a senior fellow at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said the proposal was “consistent with efforts to protect natural gas’s favored status in our home energy markets.”“Whether through legal protection of their ability to serve customers, preemption of pro-electrification local policies, or financial incentives and disincentives, the gas industry pushes for, and often gets, legal protection against a waning customer base,” she said."}, {"title": "Dem Leaders Aim For House Votes Amid Final Budget Disputes", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — With nearly no votes to spare, Democratic leaders tried resolving lingering concerns of moderate lawmakers Friday in hopes of finally pushing President Joe Biden’s multitrillion-dollar domestic agenda through the House.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other leaders met privately with a handful of centrists who say they want an official cost estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office before voting on a 10-year, $1.85 trillion social and environment bill. Democrats can lose no more than three votes in the narrowly divided House to pass the legislation.Biden, meeting reporters to tout a strong monthly jobs report, said he was returning to the Oval Office “to make some calls” to lawmakers. He said he would ask them to “vote yes on both these bills right now.”Leaders want to pass that legislation, and a separate five-year, $1 trillion package of road and other infrastructure projects, to quickly notch accomplishments just days after a gubernatorial election defeat in Virginia and disappointing contests elsewhere. They also want the votes to occur before Congress leaves by the weekend for a week-long recess.Leaders have said complete CBO figures won’t be available for days or more. “We’re working on it,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said of the talks. By late morning, a House procedural vote was underway that started over three hours earlier as behind-the-scenes discussions continued.House passage of Biden’s larger measure would send it to the Senate, where it would face certain changes and more Democratic drama. That’s chiefly because of demands by Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to contain the measure’s costs and curb or drop some of its initiatives.But House approval of the smaller, bipartisan infrastructure measure would send it directly to the White House, where Biden would be certain to take a victory lap. That bill, projected to create mountains of jobs, had been blocked by House progressives to pressure moderates to back the larger family and climate change legislation.Pelosi met late Thursday with Hispanic lawmakers wanting the larger measure to go as far as possible in helping immigrants remain in the U.S. Their prospects for bold action are limited by strict Senate rules, though. Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., said Friday that they’d discussed moving on the issue in other bills and considered Pelosi an ally.After months of negotiations, House passage of the big bill would be a crucial step, sending to the Senate Biden’s effort to expand health care, child care and other social services and deliver a huge investment to fight climate change.Alongside the slimmer roads-bridges-and-broadband package, it adds up to Biden’s answer to his campaign promise to rebuild the country from the COVID-19 crisis and confront a changing economy.Pelosi’s strategy seemed focused on passing the most robust bill possible in her chamber and then leaving the Senate to adjust or strip out the portions its members won’t agree to. In late tweaks to the bill to nail down votes, the House Rules Committee approved revisions to a state-and-local tax deduction and other issues.Half the size of Biden’s initial $3.5 trillion package, the bill exceeds 2,100 pages and has support progressive lawmakers, even though it is smaller than they wanted. But the chamber’s more centrist and fiscally conservative Democrats continued to mount objections.Republicans opposed the measure as too expensive and damaging to the economy.Overall the package remains more far-reaching than any other in decades. It would provide large numbers of Americans with assistance to pay for health care, raising children and caring for elderly people at home.There would be lower prescription drug costs, limiting the price of insulin to $35 a dose. Medicare for the first time would be able to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices for some other drugs, a long-sought Democratic priority.Medicare would have a new hearing aid benefit for older Americans, and those with Medicare Part D would see their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs capped at $2,000.The package would provide some $555 billion in tax breaks encouraging cleaner energy and electric vehicles, the nation’s largest commitment to tackling climate change.With a flurry of late adjustments, the Democrats added key provisions in recent days — adding back a new paid family leave program and work permits for immigrants. Late changes Thursday would raise a $10,000 cap on state-and-local tax deductions to $80,000.Much of the package’s cost would be covered with higher taxes on wealthier Americans, those earning more than $400,000 a year, and a 5% surtax would be added on those making over $10 million annually. Large corporations would face a new 15% minimum tax in an effort to stop big businesses from claiming so many deductions that they end up paying zero in taxes.Democrats have been working to resolve their differences, particularly with senators Manchin and Sinema, who forced cutbacks to Biden’s bill but championed the slimmer infrastructure package that had stalled amid deliberations.Manchin has panned the new family and medical leave program, which is expected to provide four weeks of paid time off after childbirth, for recovery from major illness or for caring for family members, less than the 12-week program once envisioned.Senators are also likely to strip out a just-added immigration provision that would create a new program for some 7 million immigrants who are in the country without legal standing, allowing them to apply for permits to work and travel in the U.S. for five years. It’s not clear that addition would pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian under special budget rules being used to process the package.___Associated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Aamer Madhani and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Leopard Cub Runs For Its Life From Hyena And A Tall Savior Emerges", "text": "When a leopard cub got chased by a hungry hyena in South Africa’s Kruger National Park, it looked like curtains.

But it also depends on trade policies that artificially inflate the price of imported goods and threaten to slow the speed at which solar energy grows while prioritizing a segment of the industry that employs fewer workers.“As we accelerate the transition to renewable energy, we can’t rely upon imports, particularly from countries with whom we may not have stable trading relationships,” Ossoff told HuffPost in a phone interview this week. “My legislation would spark a global realignment of solar supply chains by bringing every step of that supply chain ― from polysilicon to ingots and wafers to modules ― to the U.S.”On Friday, the senator is scheduled to fly to Glasgow, Scotland, to attend the United Nations’ climate summit. From there, he’s scheduled to travel to South Korea, where he plans to meet with high-ranking government and corporate officials in a bid to encourage more manufacturers to open factories in the U.S.The few remaining solar manufacturers in the U.S. have benefited from tariffs the Trump administration put in place in 2018. Starting at 30% and dropping 5% each year, the import duties were meant to make panels built in the U.S. with this country’s higher labor and material costs competitive with the much cheaper hardware that China produces.In response, the U.S. division of South Korean solar giant Hanwha Q Cells opened the Western Hemisphere’s largest panel assembly plant in Dalton, Georgia, in September 2019. Georgia is also home to one of the country’s largest electric-vehicle battery factories, owned by SK Innovation, another South Korean behemoth.“My vision is that the U.S. should lead the world in renewable energy technology, innovation and manufacturing, and that Georgia should lead the nation,” Ossoff said.Ossoff’s bill would expand the domestic supply chain by giving tax credits to companies that manufacture the photovoltaic cells ― the individual sunlight-absorbing black or gray strips on a solar panel ― 4 cents per watt of electricity, an industry measurement calculated by totaling the cost of the equipment and dividing it by its electricity-generating capacity.Firms that then assemble their own U.S.-made cells into modules ― the pieces that, when put together in an array, make up a full panel ― would receive 11 cents per watt. Manufacturers that assemble imported cells into modules would get 7 cents.The average cost of a U.S.-made module comes out to about 33 cents per watt, so the tax credits would cover up to a third of the manufacturing expenses for a firm making its own cells.But the most generous tax credits in the bill would go to making wafers, the thin slices of crystalline silicon that power each cell and of which there is virtually no production in the U.S. The legislation provides 5.5 cents per watt on an item that costs on average 8 cents to make, covering roughly two-thirds of the manufacturing expense.Past attempts to bring clean-energy manufacturing back from low-cost, minimally regulated developing countries in East Asia to Western nations with strict labor and environmental rules have largely fizzled. A lengthy essay in the London Review of Books this summer chronicled the rise and fall of a Korean-owned wind turbine factory in Scotland and concluded that production seemed destined to return to the cut-rate assembly plants in Vietnam once the European country’s incentives ran out.Solar manufacturing is far more automated than wind turbine factories, so the higher labor costs and different working patterns are a lesser concern for East Asian companies setting up shop in North America or Europe. But Ossoff’s bill also proposed a novel approach to getting manufacturers to not only open factories but also keep them running.Unlike the tax credits the Obama administration enacted more than a decade ago, which paid companies based on just building factories, the incentives in Ossoff’s legislation kick in only when firms actually produce things. This means the manufacturers will need to find buyers and integrate into the supply chain, increasing the chances that the business lasts.“The Obama-era manufacturing incentives encouraged companies to build a big factory, cash in on the incentive, but there was no incentive to stay in the country after they cashed out,” said Pol Lezcano, a solar analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF. “The structure Ossoff proposes is incentivizing the factory to actually be productive and continue to be relevant into the future, meaning you’re not getting everything upfront in the first 12 months once you commission the factory.”He said it was “the first time we’ve seen an incentive structured this way.” The model hews closer to how developing countries attract foreign companies to set up local shops. India, for example, pays manufacturers per unit of output they produce. China offers government-backed financing and low interest rates for local factories. And Brazil provides solar companies with cheap loans through the Brazilian Development Bank but only if the firms use locally made panels and components.Still, according to BloombergNEF, the tax credits make U.S. manufacturing truly competitive with Chinese factories only if tariffs remain in place on East Asian imports. The U.S. solar industry, which primarily employs Americans selling and installing panels, complained that the duties killed jobs in a business that, in 2016, took on one in every 50 new hires. But President Joe Biden rebuffed the industry’s requests to end the tariffs.Now the U.S. International Trade Commission is considering whether to extend the tariffs, and the Commerce Department is weighing a separate request from an anonymous petitioner to slap new import duties on panels from Southeast Asia.The companies that requested the tariffs the Trump administration granted said the import duties would create 45,000 jobs in solar manufacturing. But solar factory jobs actually declined by 9% last year alone, according to the most recent job census from the industry-backed Solar Foundation.The Solar Energy Industries Association, the sector’s most powerful national trade group, urged the Biden administration to end the tariffs and reject the request for new ones.“The bottom line is that the climate can’t afford these tariffs,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the trade association’s president, said in a statement. “Commerce should reject these baseless petitions now because the climate, the economy and thousands of American jobs are on the line.”Ossoff declined to comment on the tariffs, stating that he was “still reviewing the trade policy debate.”“My focus at this time is on enacting legislation that will allow us to rapidly scale a fully integrated domestic supply chain,” he said.Doing so, said Lezcano, may be at odds with rapidly creating jobs and deploying solar energy.“You just have very different priorities, and those priorities are not necessarily complementary to each other,” Lezcano said. “If your goal is geopolitics and domestic supply-chain security, onshoring is a solution for that. If your objective is purely economics and rapid adoption, then the right way to go is to remove all the tariffs and get the cheapest modules.”Ossoff said the politics of domestic manufacturing matter. Democrats’ losses in this week’s state elections are widely seen as a harbinger of a Republican wave in the 2022 midterm election that could give the GOP control of Congress and make it harder for the Biden administration to pass legislation. Yet, Ossoff said he was “already working with Republican officials at the state and local level to build Georgia as a national leader in renewable energy.”“We have a clear and compelling national interest in building our industrial base, manufacturing capacity and technological innovation, in developing more energy independence and national security interest in not being reliant upon certain foreign markets for some of these components and technologies,” Ossoff said. “It’s a unifying issue, and it should be a unifying issue.”"}, {"title": "Only 2% Of Great Barrier Reef Has Escaped Coral Bleaching, Study Finds", "text": "The Great Barrier Reef has been walloped by warming seas time and time again, and scientists now say almost the entire span of the natural wonder has been hit with coral bleaching in recent years, a troubling figure that amplifies the warning bells about the effects of climate change happening right now.A new study, published Friday in the journal Current Biology, found just 2% of the Great Barrier Reef has escaped bleaching over the past 30 years. The first major mass bleaching in 1998 prompted dire warnings from coral biologists, who said warming seas amounted to an underwater apocalypse for delicate coral ecosystems.But climate change has since continued largely unabated, and professor Terry Hughes, a lead author of the report and the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said bleaching events that used to be “unprecedented or very rare” are now commonplace.“Five bouts of mass bleaching since 1998 have turned the Great Barrier Reef into a checkerboard of reefs with very different recent histories, ranging from 2% of reefs that have escaped bleaching altogether, to 80% that have now bleached severely at least once since 2016,” Hughes said in a statement.That 98% of the reef has been hit with calamitous bleaching is significant. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on the planet, stretching nearly 1,500 miles and comprising more than 3,000 individual reefs.The study adds that bleaching events need to be considered as a series of ailments rather than one-off catastrophes to determine how corals can recover over time. Interestingly, the authors found that areas of the Great Barrier Reef that were hit with a mass bleaching event before were more tolerant to future stressors, while the most vulnerable reefs were those that hadn’t been suffered bleaching in recent years.The accumulation of bleaching events over several decades “highlights the grave risk that without immediate global action on greenhouse gas emissions, more frequent and more severe bleaching events will continue to undermine the resilience of coral reef ecosystems,” the authors said.Corals are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Warmer waters linked to the phenomenon can effectively cook the delicate structures, causing reefs to bleach as the once-colorful polyps turn bone white when the algae that feeds them leave their skeletons. If temperatures return to normal, the corals can recover over time, but if waters stay warm for too long, stretches of reefs that took decades to grow can die.Bleached reefs can recover, but it takes years. Scientists have long warned that back-to-back mass bleaching events, like those in 2016, 2017 and 2020, don’t give corals enough time to heal.The forecast for the planet’s corals is bleak. A recent report found the world lost 14% of its corals from 2009 to 2018 due to heat waves linked to climate change. That figure is huge, effectively amounting to about 4,500 square miles of reef, or more than all of the living coral off the cost of Australia, including the Great Barrier.The latest study comes amid the United Nations climate summit, COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders and dignitaries are attempting to hash out the planet’s best hope for averting the worst effects of climate change.Hughes said Friday that how reefs like the Great Barrier fare depends on humanity getting its act together to limit greenhouse gas emissions, although he stressed there is still time for the world to act. Australia, however, has largely refused to sign on to pledges to abandon coal mining and limit methane emissions, instead releasing vague plans to rein in emissions by 2050s that have been lambasted by scientists.“Where the reef ends up depends on how much warmer it gets,” he told The Guardian. “If we stabilize at 1.5 degrees [Celsius], which is unlikely, the reef might be OK. … While we are not going to see the Great Barrier Reef like it was 20 years ago, we can still have a reef if countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade.”"}, {"title": "Experts Bemoan Biden’s Mixed Messages On Old-Growth Forests", "text": "A group of U.S. forest ecologists, climate scientists and conservationists are calling out what they view as a “huge disconnect” between President Joe Biden’s rhetoric about the urgent need to combat deforestation and the policies he’s advancing back home.In remarks on his last day at COP26, the United Nations climate summit being held in Glasgow, Scotland, Biden touted the $550 billion in climate spending included in his Build Back Better plan making its way through Congress and applauded a new 100-country pledge to halt deforestation by the end of the decade.“Preserving forests and other ecosystems can and should play an important role in meeting our ambitious climate goals as part of the net-zero emissions strategy we all have,” Biden said Tuesday. “The United States is going to lead by our example at home and support other forested nations and developing countries in setting and achieving ambitious action to conserve and restore these carbon sinks.”His comments came a day after the White House released a 65-page long-term strategy for slashing greenhouse gas emissions that includes eyebrow-raising language about forest carbon removal: “Substantial forested lands, including large portions of our Western public lands, now have older forests which sequester less CO2 and are more vulnerable to natural disturbances.”The line left “a lot of people going — pardon my French — ‘What the fuck!’” said Steve Pedery, conservation director at environmental organization Oregon Wild.Pedery said the strategy document seems to float logging — specifically, cutting down mature stands of trees in order to plant younger ones — as a solution to climate change and climate-fueled wildfires.“What’s next, resurrecting ‘clean coal’ and warning against the dangers of windmill cancer?” he said.Old-growth forests sequester massive amounts of carbon in trees and soil, and scientists say protecting the few that remain intact will prove key to meeting climate and biodiversity targets.Three forest scientists HuffPost interviewed — William Moomaw, professor emeritus of international environmental policy at Tufts University, Chad Hanson, forest ecologist at the John Muir Project’s Earth Island Institute, and Dominick DellaSala, chief scientist at forest advocacy group Wild Heritage — shared Pedery’s interpretation of the language.The strategy document is “riddled with forestry science holes,” DellaSala said.“We’ve got three ships passing in the night and we don’t have any skipper at the helm,” he added. “We’ve got a huge disconnect. ... What the heck is going on? It’s an embarrassment on a global stage, if people are able to read between the lines.”Moomaw is a five-time lead author of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and considered the father of “proforestation,” which he defines as “growing forests to achieve their ecological potential for carbon accumulation and biodiversity.”Moomaw said there’s a point at which growth and the rate of carbon storage peaks in a forest, usually in the midlife of the trees. This has led timber interests to argue ancient forests should be cut down and replaced with young trees. Moomaw called it “magical thinking.”“Those younger trees, between now and 2050, will never have accumulated out of the atmosphere nearly as much carbon as the older trees would in that same growth time,” he said. “In other words, 30 years of growth of an older forest is going to remove more carbon out of the atmosphere by 2050 than planting new trees and letting them grow for 30 years.”All three said Biden’s climate strategy document parrots that very industry talking point about replacing old trees with young ones. It’s a position that both ignores the initial carbon release from cutting down mature trees and operates on a timeline at odds with the emissions reductions scientists say are required to avoid catastrophic planetary warming.“Any time you take trees out of the forests, you’re putting most of that carbon into the atmosphere,” DellaSala said.“It’s all about the next few decades,” Hanson said. “The bottom line is we need to dramatically increase protection of existing forests — mature forests, old-growth forests, primary forests.”As HuffPost previously reported, conservationists grew frustrated with the Biden administration early on over its lack of a strong commitment to halt logging of mature and old temperate forests in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. But in July, Biden moved to reverse the Trump administration’s dismantling of protections and end large-scale logging of old-growth trees in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest.After celebrating the Tongass decision as a sign that Biden is serious about using intact forests as a tool in the climate fight, many are once again feeling irked.This week, Congress is expected to vote on the president’s bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and accompanying $1.75 trillion spending package. The two pieces of legislation include several provisions that some experts and advocates argue will increase logging on federal and private lands, undermine the bills’ massive clean energy investments, and worsen planetary warming.As of Thursday, more than 200 climate scientists and forest ecologists have signed a letter calling for Biden and Congress to remove the provisions, including $14 billion in Build Back Better for “hazardous fuels reduction projects” on national forest lands and mandates in the infrastructure bill to reduce wildfire risk across 30 million acres of federal lands.In the letter, which Moomaw, Hanson, DellaSala and others spearheaded, the group argues that the two bills’ forests provisions “are promoted as wildfire management and climate solutions measures, but commercial logging conducted under the guise of ‘thinning’ and ‘fuel reduction’ typically removes mature, fire-resistant trees that are needed for forest resilience.”“We need the Administration and Congress to enact policies that will substantially reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from logging, and from fossil fuels, and increase accumulation of carbon in our forests,” the letter reads. Other lead signatories include Beverly Law, a professor emeritus at Oregon State University and an expert on the forest carbon cycle, and William Ripple, a climate scientist and professor of ecology at Oregon State.The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Hanson has plenty of critics. The Sacramento Bee reported last month about a series of scientific journal articles in which fire scientists criticized his opposition to thinning as a tool to reduce the risks of wildfires. One scientist, Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist at the University of Washington, went as far as to compare Hanson and his allies to climate change deniers. Hanson published a rebuttal of what he called “a heavily slanted article” and “attacks by Forest Service-funded scientists.”Environmentalists are also not united on the idea that Biden’s Build Back Better plan would negatively impact America’s forests. In an interview with Vox, Collin O’Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, called the bill “the most significant investment ever in our national forests” and “an astonishingly big deal.”As part of the new COP26 initiative, Biden said the U.S. would spend up to $9 billion toward the international effort to end deforestation and safeguard forest ecosystems. The funding would have to be approved by Congress, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) has already introduced legislation to establish a $9 billion trust fund.More than 100 nations representing 85% of the world’s forests signed on to the pact. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about whether it will lead to real change. The New York Declaration on Forests, enacted at the U.N. climate conference in 2014, set a goal of cutting deforestation in half by 2020 and ending it altogether by 2030. Instead, deforestation has continued to soar.The world loses an estimated 27 football fields of trees to deforestation every minute.Back in April, dozens of environmental groups, including the National Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, called on the Biden administration to impose a moratorium on all old-growth logging in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and to make the protection of carbon-rich forests a central part of its push during COP26. More than 120 green groups renewed those calls in an Oct. 28 letter to the White House.“It is not enough to simply pressure developing countries on older forest and rainforest protections — the U.S. must take meaningful action to conserve and restore carbon-rich forests and trees across all our forest types here at home,” the organizations wrote last week."}, {"title": "New Zealand Potato Named 'Doug' Just Might Be The World's Biggest", "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Colin and Donna Craig-Brown were weeding their garden in New Zealand when Colin’s hoe struck something huge just beneath the soil’s surface.As the couple knelt down and began digging around the object, Colin wondered if it was some kind of strange fungal growth, a giant puffball. After Colin pried it out with his garden fork, he scratched away a bit of the skin and tasted it.A potato.“We couldn’t believe it,” Donna said. “It was just huge.”And not exactly pretty. Donna describes its appearance as more of an ugly, mutant look.But it’s quite possibly the largest potato on record. When the couple lugged it into their garage and put it on their old set of scales, it weighed in at a remarkable 7.9 kilograms (17.4 pounds). That’s equal to a couple of sacks of regular potatoes, or one small dog.In the weeks since their unusual find on Aug. 30, the couple’s potato has become something of a celebrity around their small farm near Hamilton. They’ve named the potato Doug, after the way it was unearthed, and Colin even built a small cart to tow Doug around.“We put a hat on him. We put him on Facebook, taking him for a walk, giving him some sunshine,” Doug said. “It’s all a bit of fun. It’s amazing what entertains people.”A more official weigh-in at a local farming store put Doug at 7.8 kg. The current Guinness World Records entry for the heaviest potato is a 2011 monster from Britain that weighed in at just under 5 kg. The couple say they’ve applied to Guinness to have Doug recognized and are waiting to hear back.Guinness didn’t immediately reply to a request for an update on the application.Colin said he doesn’t have any secret gardening tips. Usually they throw a bunch of cow manure and straw onto their garden and see what happens. He said they’d been growing cucumbers in that area of their garden before the weeds took over and hadn’t planted any potatoes. Doug must have been self-sown, and quite possibly growing for a couple of years or more.“It’s a mystery to me,” Colin said. “It’s one of nature’s little pleasant surprises.”But Doug hasn’t proved an easy charge to look after. As the couple showed the potato off, it began drying out and losing weight. Mold started growing from its wounds.“He was getting a bit pongy,” said Colin, referring to the potato’s smell.So Colin cleaned up Doug as best he could and put the potato in the freezer, where it remains.But Colin may not be done with Doug yet. An amateur brewer, Colin said he’s keen to turn Doug into a nice drop of potato vodka."}, {"title": "Astronauts Make 'Best Space Tacos Yet' With Key Ingredient They Just Learned To Grow", "text": "Call it one tasty leap for mankind.Astronauts figured out how to grow a chile pepper in space for the first time, NASA announced. The crew aboard the International Space Station celebrated successfully growing green Hatch chiles — a type of pepper found in New Mexico’s Hatch Valley — in microgravity by whipping up a batch of space tacos.Astronaut Megan McArthur shared photos Friday of what she called her “best space tacos yet” on Twitter. The Mexican-inspired meal consisted of fajita beef, rehydrated tomatoes and artichokes, and a Hatch chile grown on the ISS. Sadly, no green cheese from the moon was available for grating atop the space tacos.The crop of Hatch chiles was part of NASA’s Plant Habitat-04 investigation, according to NASA. The scientists began growing the spicy pods on the ISS in July in an effort to understand more about “plant-microbe interactions” in space.Astronauts have been victorious in getting other veggies, such as radishes, Chinese cabbage, mizuna mustard, red Russian kale and three types of lettuce, to grow on the ISS. They’ve also grown zinnia flowers.But what makes the Hatch chiles significant is that they are more difficult to grow in microgravity because they take a relatively long time to germinate and bear fruit, according to NASA.And the point of the chile pepper experiment wasn’t just so astronauts could zhuzh up their presumably bland dehydrated food menu. Scientists want to expand the number of crops that astronauts can grow in space so their tummies can stay full during more ambitious missions in the future, NASA explained in a July news release.“The challenge is the ability to feed crews in low-Earth orbit and then to sustain explorers during future missions beyond low-Earth orbit to destinations including the Moon as part of the Artemis program and eventually to Mars,” said Matt Romeyn, principal investigator for NASA’s Plant Habitat-04 experiment. “We are limited to crops that don’t need storage or extensive processing.”So it looks like astronauts may get to munch on some Hatch chiles on future missions. Hopefully a crop of antacids is next."}, {"title": "Research Suggests Extensive COVID-19 Infections In White-Tailed Deer", "text": "A new study has found extensive COVID-19 infections in Iowa’s white-tailed deer population, prompting concerns about an animal reservoir where the virus could linger, mutate and potentially reinfect humans.The research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and was released in preprint Monday, found 12 different strains of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in roughly one-third of 283 deer in the state tested between April and December 2020.The disease appears to have spread dramatically soon after that initial time period. Additional testing performed from November 2020 through January 2021 found positive results in 82.5% of 97 deer tested.“It was effectively showing up in all parts of the state,” Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinary microbiologist at Penn State who co-authored the study, told The New York Times. “We were dumbfounded.”Kuchipudi and his colleague Dr. Vivek Kapur said it’s reasonable to assume other states with dense deer populations are seeing similar rates of transmission.While we’ve known for some time that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide range of other species, including dogs, cats, lions, tigers, gorillas and otters, so far, widespread infection of a non-captive animal population like deer hadn’t been documented until now.“Our study is the first to provide evidence of widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 into any free-living species, in this case, white tailed deer,” the report reads. “Our results suggest that deer have the potential to emerge as a major reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2, a finding that has important implications for the virus genomic diversity and future trajectory of the pandemic.”Tyler Harms, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, told Des Moines’ CBS affiliate it appears the deer are getting sick from humans; so far, it hasn’t been the other way around.With deer hunting season underway, that’s a critically important distinction. Harms said the state is recommending hunters wear masks and gloves if they are in close physical contact with deer and that meat be cooked to an appropriate temperature before it’s consumed.Scientists have long worried COVID-19 could find an animal reservoir from which variants of the disease could reemerge and infect humans at some point in the future.Given the estimated 30 million white-tailed deer distributed throughout the continental U.S., and their penchant for living in close proximity to humans, the authors conclude that’s a very real concern and merits closer surveillance."}, {"title": "Stephen Colbert Perfectly Explains The Climate Crisis Using Jim Carrey Movies", "text": "“The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert had an Ace Ventura up his sleeve Tuesday to emphasize the urgency of the climate crisis.Noting that Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro had reportedly referred to U.S. climate envoy John Kerry as Jim Carrey, Colbert said: “But I think he meant Jim Carrey.

Joe Manchin.In a video posted to Twitter, the activists — Kidus Girma, 26, Ema Govea, 18, Julia Paramo, 24, and Abby Leedy, 20 — announced the end to a hunger strike they started on Oct. 20, meant to pressure President Joe Biden and other U.S. government leaders to take stronger action to avert the worst of the climate crisis.Another activist, Paul Campion, 24, ended his strike earlier this week after being sent to the hospital and diagnosed with bradycardia, which develops when one’s heartbeat falls to an abnormally slow rate and can be life-threatening.In their post, the activists noted Biden’s pledge at the global climate summit COP26 to cut fossil fuel emissions in the U.S. in half by 2030 — a promise he’d publicly made months ago.“We are ending our hunger strike to bring the fire to Joe Manchin and other folks in Congress that are more willing to fight for oil and gas billionaires and not for the young people and their communities,” Girma said in the video.Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, has been an obstacle to several of Biden’s and progressive lawmakers’ more ambitious proposals for the Build Back Better spending package.Manchin, whose home state and personal wealth rely on the coal industry, effectively blocked the president’s clean electricity program, which would pay power companies to replace coal and gas plants with renewables, retrofit them with carbon-capture technology, or pay fines.Late last week, Biden announced a compromise that Democrats had reached on the spending bill, which would make historic climate investments — but the legislation would still fall far short of what experts say is needed to keep global warming from reaching catastrophic levels.The hunger strike was extremely physically demanding on the young activists. When HuffPost spoke to Leedy last week, she said they had a lot of fatigue, stomach pain, and muscle and joint aches. Outside the White House, they sat in wheelchairs because they could not walk for long without the risk of falling or fainting from weakness.Last week, Girma was hospitalized overnight for nausea, dizziness and blurred vision but then returned to the strike.The Sunrise Movement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The activists are calling for people to gather for a climate protest on Thursday in Washington, D.C."}, {"title": "Shakira Still Shook By Recent Wild Boar Attack", "text": "Shakira is still recovering from a wild boar attack that happened in September.The singer went viral after reporting that two wild boars destroyed her bag at a park in Barcelona, Spain, and now she’s revealing the most shocking aspect of the encounter: No one tried to help her.“It’s just crazy!” Shakira told Glamour UK about the reaction to the boar attack.“I was taking my son, Milan, for a walk in the park and I got him a little ice cream,” she explained. “We sat on one of those park benches and we were just minding our own business. And then two huge wild boars came from the back and ambushed [us] and took my purse!”Shakira said her first reaction was to scream “Oh, my God!

It was wild.”Although Shakira probably would have liked help with the boars, it apparently was not an isolated incident.The animals, deemed among the world’s most invasive by the World Conservation Union, have become an everyday sight in cities like Barcelona and Rome, according to The Guardian.Back in 2016, Spanish police received nearly 1,200 phone calls about nuisances created by boars, including traffic disturbances, rooting through garbage and attacking domestic animals."}, {"title": "There Is No Reason To Trust Brazil’s Climate, Deforestation Pledges", "text": "During a speech Monday at the United Nations’ climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, President Joe Biden called on world nations to do their part to avert catastrophic planetary warming.“This is the challenge of our collective lifetimes, the existential threat to human existence as we know it, and every day we delay the cost of inaction increases,” Biden said. “Let this be the moment when we answer history’s call. ... Let this be the start of a decade of transformative action.”As Biden concluded his speech, John Kerry, the Biden administration’s special climate envoy, took to Twitter to applaud Brazil for its new climate commitments, including pledges to end illegal deforestation by 2028 — two years ahead of its previous target — and slash greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade.“This adds crucial momentum to the global movement to combat the #ClimateCrisis,” Kerry wrote. “Looking forward to working together!”The U.S. has held on-again, off-again talks with the Bolsonaro government over climate and deforestation since the beginning of the Biden administration, which sees its attempts to bring Brazil back to the table on environmental concerns as a centerpiece of its efforts to reestablish the United States’ own leadership role in global climate efforts.But Brazil’s “new” pledges are far less ambitious than they seem at first glance, experts say.The emissions goal is “just a correction” to a previous policy that far-right President Jair Bolsonaro’s government outlined in December, said Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of São Paulo-based Climate Observatory.The 2020 target would’ve allowed Brazil to emit 400 million additional tons of carbon than it would have under pledges the country made in 2015. The new pledge merely puts Brazil back on the same path it had already plotted six years ago, when then-President Dilma Rousseff signed the country onto the Paris Climate agreement.“They just aligned the numbers to have the same emissions pledges for 2030 that the country already had in 2015,” Astrini said. The Bolsonaro government, he added, is “running to the past while the world is no longer the same, the climate emergency has [worsened] and countries are being called to look to the future.”On Tuesday, more than 100 nations, including Brazil, the U.S., Canada and Russia, signed an initiative to halt deforestation by the end of the decade. The international pledge is backed by nearly $20 billion in public and private funds, and includes countries that collectively represent 85% of the world’s forests.There is little, if any, reason to trust that the Bolsonaro administration is serious about curbing greenhouse gas emissions or stopping the razing of the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest. Much like former President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro has turned his nation into a global pariah on climate issues. He didn’t even show up for COP26 in Glasgow.Once a global leader on climate, emissions reductions and the environment, Brazil has dramatically reversed course under Bolsonaro, a climate skeptic who has rolled back protections for the Amazon rainforest and presided over record outbreaks of fires and destruction in the Amazon, the tropical wetlands of Brazil’s Pantanal, and the Cerrado, a biologically rich savannah and major carbon sink that has been destroyed to make way for beef and soy production.Safeguarding forests like the Amazon is key to limiting future warming, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned. An alarming report this year found that the Brazilian Amazon is now emitting more carbon dioxide than it’s absorbing.One way Brazil could achieve its promise to end “illegal deforestation” is by simply legalizing it — something Bolsonaro has actively tried to do.“The Bolsonaro government’s pledge to reign in illegal Amazon deforestation, which it has allowed to explode under its watch, rings particularly hollow in light of the legislative assault it is currently waging on the country’s environmental framework, which will essentially open the floodgates to continued devastation,” said Christian Poirier, program director at ​​environmental nonprofit Amazon Watch. “This legislation includes an effort to slash environmental licensing and land tenure standards, which will in effect legalize deforestation that is currently considered illegal.”He added: “The world cannot trust the word of a government that has facilitated the wholesale destruction of the Amazon while forest guardians are left increasingly vulnerable to a mounting wave of violence.”Deforestation has surged during Bolsonaro’s tenure, as loggers, miners and agricultural interests emboldened by his policies move deeper into the jungle. So have violent raids on Indigenous tribal lands — conflicts that have resulted in the killings of several Amazon tribal leaders.“While you are closing your eyes to reality, the land defender Ari Uru Eu Wau Wau, my friend since I was a kid, was murdered for protecting the forest,” Txai Suruí, an Indigenous activist from Brazil’s Amazon, told world leaders at the United Nations conference on Monday. “Indigenous peoples are on the front line of the climate emergency, and we must be at the center of the decisions happening here.”Satellite data from Brazilian monitors shows that deforestation rates in July hit their highest point since 2012. Earlier this month, environmental organization AllRise filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court accusing Bolsonaro of crimes against humanity for “fueling the mass destruction of the Amazon with his eyes wide open and in full knowledge of the consequences.”On a call with reporters Monday afternoon, senior Biden administration officials were asked to weigh in on new early pledges at COP26. One official commended Brazil for its updated deforestation and emissions-reduction targets.“We see movement from key countries like Brazil in these crucial days here, in this crucial decade,” an administration official said.That Kerry and the U.S. celebrated Brazil’s purported progress, Astrini said, is likely a result of the low expectations the world has for “what this government can actually deliver.”“Anything from this government, even bullshit, will be applauded by some,” Astrini said."}, {"title": "U.S. Joins More Than 100 Countries In Pledge To End Deforestation In Coming Decade", "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — More than 100 countries pledged Tuesday to end deforestation in the coming decade — a promise that experts say would be critical to limiting climate change but one that has been made and broken before.Britain hailed the commitment as the first big achievement of the U.N. climate conference known as COP26 taking place this month in the Scottish city of Glasgow. But campaigners say they need to see the details to understand its full impact.The U.K. government said it has received commitments from leaders representing more than 85% of the world’s forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Among them are several countries with massive forests, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States.More than $19 billion in public and private funds have been pledged toward the plan.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that “with today’s unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity’s long history as nature’s conqueror, and instead become its custodian.”Forests are important ecosystems and provide a critical way of absorbing carbon dioxide — the main greenhouse gas — from the atmosphere. Trees are one of the world’s major so-called carbon sinks, or places where carbon is stored.But the value of wood as a commodity and the growing demand for agricultural and pastoral land are leading to widespread and often illegal felling of forests, particularly in developing countries.Experts cautioned that similar agreements in the past have failed to be effective.Alison Hoare, a senior research fellow at political think tank Chatham House, said world leaders promised in 2014 to end deforestation by 2030, “but since then deforestation has accelerated across many countries.”“This new pledge recognizes the range of actions needed to protect our forests, including finance, support for rural livelihoods, and strong trade policies,” she said. “For it to succeed, inclusive processes and equitable legal frameworks will be needed, and governments must work with civil society, businesses and Indigenous peoples to agree, monitor and implement them.”Luciana Tellez Chavez, an environmental researcher at Human Rights Watch, emphasized that strengthening Indigenous people’s rights would help prevent deforestation and should be part of the agreement.About 130 world leaders are in Glasgow for what host Britain says is the last realistic chance to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels — the goal the world set in Paris six years ago.Increased warming over coming decades would melt much of the planet’s ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, scientists say.On Monday, the leaders heard stark warnings from officials and activists alike about those dangers. Britain’s Johnson described global warming as “a doomsday device” strapped to humanity. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told his colleagues that humans are “digging our own graves.” And Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, warned leaders not to “allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction.”Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II urged the leaders “to rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship.”“Of course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: We none of us will live forever,” she said in a video message played at a Monday evening reception in Glasgow’s Kelvingrove museum. “But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children’s children, and those who will follow in their footsteps.”The 95-year-old monarch had planned to attend the meeting, but she had to cancel the trip after doctors said she should rest and not travel.The British government said Monday it saw positive signs that world leaders understood the gravity of the situation. On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden was due to present his administration’s plan to reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. The announcement was part of a broader effort with the European Union and other nations to reduce overall methane emissions worldwide by 30% by 2030.But campaigners say the world’s biggest carbon emitters need to do much more. Earth has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). Current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C (4.9F) by the year 2100.Climate activist Greta Thunberg told a rally outside the high-security climate venue that the talk inside was just “ blah blah blah” and would achieve little.“Change is not going to come from inside there,” she told some of the thousands of protesters who have come to Glasgow to make their voices heard. “That is not leadership, this is leadership.”"}, {"title": "White House Takes Dramatic Steps To Limit Methane Emissions In Major Climate Policy", "text": "The Biden administration on Tuesday unveiled a set of sweeping policies to rein in methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas far stronger than carbon dioxide, in what will be one of the nation’s most dramatic steps yet to limit the runaway effects of climate change.Methane is the second most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, and is emitted by oil and gas drilling, agriculture and landfills. It is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it’s released, and while it dissipates more quickly, it can dramatically warm the planet as it lingers in the atmosphere.The policies unveiled Tuesday will include the nation’s first effort to limit methane emissions from existing oil and gas wells, the largest single source of the greenhouse gas in the nation. There are about a million such wells in the U.S. The rules would also include regular and stringent leak monitoring and require the capture of natural gas released during oil drilling that often escapes into the atmosphere, The Washington Post reported.“It is now abundantly clear that America is back and leading by example in confronting the climate crisis with bold ambition,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan told The Associated Press.The Obama administration attempted to limit methane emissions on new drilling sites from 2015, but those policies were rolled back by Donald Trump as part of his aggressive strategy to gut the nation’s environmental laws. Biden had vowed to restore and strengthen them, and The New York Times notes the methane plans will be a core strategy of his effort to tackle climate change.The policies also include efforts to limit emissions from landfills and agriculture, a total package that will allow the U.S. to meet Biden’s targets to see the world reduce its methane emissions by 30% by 2030, when compared to 2020 levels. The president said Monday a coalition of 70 countries had joined that pledge, although many of the world’s biggest emitters — China, India, Russia and Brazil — have not signed on.The president is in Glasgow, Scotland, for the United Nations’ climate change conference, COP26, where many world leaders and dignitaries hope to hash out plans to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century and keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius about pre-industrial levels.Failure to do so, scientists have long warned, would result in an increasingly dire series of calamities, including drought, extreme weather and untold devastation for vulnerable communities worldwide.Biden has said the U.S. will aggressively cut its emissions, hoping to slash them by 50% by the end of the decade over 2005 levels."}, {"title": "Queen Elizabeth Delivers Powerful Address Nearly 2 Weeks After Health Scare", "text": "Queen Elizabeth spoke fondly of her late husband, Prince Philip, and his concern for the environment while delivering a virtual address for a reception at the United Nations climate conference, COP26, on Monday evening.The pre-recorded speech marked the queen’s first address since her hospitalization two weeks ago.“The impact of the environment on human progress was a subject close to the heart of my dear late husband,” she said, referencing a comment the Duke of Edinburgh made about climate change in 1969.“It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William,” the sovereign added. “I could not be more proud of them.”“Indeed, I have drawn great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages ― especially the young ― in calling for everyone to play their part,” she said.The queen added, “None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope. Working side by side, we have the ability to solve the most insurmountable problems and to triumph over the greatest of adversities.”“I, for one, hope that this conference will be one of those rare occasions where everyone will have the chance to rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship.”The queen was originally due to deliver her remarks in person, but her appearance was canceled after a health scare two weeks ago that left her hospitalized for “preliminary investigations.”“Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement announcing the queen’s decision not to travel.Subscribe to HuffPost’s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond)."}, {"title": "This Desert May Contain Secrets To Avoiding Climate Famine", "text": "From space, South America’s Atacama Desert looks like a craggy patch of lifeless brown stretching 49,000 square miles near Chile’s northern tip. At 7,900 feet above sea level, the parched, windswept landscape broils under the sun. It’s the world’s oldest and driest desert.Average rainfall totals little more than 0.04 inches per year, and yet plant life adorns the area in what would be the ear-shaped continent’s tragus with indigo cones of Lupinus oreophilus flowers, lime-green blobs of Azorella atacamensis, and Solanum chilense ― wild tomatoes that, when ripe, look like little dark plums.For 10 years, Rodrigo Gutiérrez made routine trips 1,000 miles north from his laboratory at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in the capital city of Santiago to 22 separate sites in the desert, where he measured the temperature and water, and collected samples of plants, soils and the microbes that cling to both. The molecular biologist then partnered with scientists from across the hemisphere and disciplines ― botanists, microbiologists, ecologists ― to decode the plants’ genes and learn how they adapted to survive in an environment extreme enough to challenge his own physical stamina.On Monday, Gutiérrez and 26 of his colleagues published nearly 300 genetic discoveries in a peer-reviewed paper in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. What they found could contain the secrets to avoiding food shortages in an increasingly hot, drought-prone world, providing scientists the genetic tools to breed resilient new crops.“With the population we have, we need to produce food and crops despite increasing desertification,” Gutiérrez said. “The only way we’ll be able to do that is if we can engineer some kind of tolerance to drought in crops.”But the findings also come as a warning of what could be lost as the global economy curbs its appetite for fossil fuels with solar panels and batteries made of lithium and copper, vast quantities of which are mined in the mineral-rich Atacama Desert.The different, and in some ways conflicting, resources for a hotter world highlight the tradeoffs of the energy transition, and give weight to environmentalists’ pleas for a new green industrial boom to avoid replicating the ecological recklessness of its fossil-fueled forerunner. Surging demand for the Atacama’s geological treasures threatens to drain what little water sustains the desert’s complex webs of life faster than nature can adapt. The region already supplies upward of 30% of the world’s lithium, a compound so desired in the green economy it’s sometimes called “white gold,” and Chile’s government is looking to expand production. Climate change, meanwhile, is only adding pressure, making the Atacama even drier than in years past.The study is as much a triumph of collaboration between continents as disciplines. The Chilean researcher collected samples of 32 dominant plant species in the Atacama, stored them in liquid nitrogen, then sequenced their RNA back at the lab in Santiago.Meanwhile, researchers at New York University and the American Museum of Natural History were assembling a computer matrix of ancient plant genes, and tapping New York Botanical Garden experts to identify 32 genetically similar “sister” species to match the Atacama samples. Plugging that mountain of data into NYU’s in-house supercomputers, the scientists started performing what’s called a phylogenomic analysis to reconstruct an evolutionary history and pinpoint which genetic proteins helped the flora survive in the desert’s harsh climate.Crunching nearly 1.7 million protein sequences and close to 8.6 million amino acids across more than 70 species, the resulting analysis zeroed in on 265 separate genes whose protein sequences mutated as the plants evolved to live in the Atacama, including those that made it easier to survive under high-light radiation, in long periods without water, and in salty and nitrogen-poor soil.To test how the genes worked, the researchers then crosschecked them with related genes in the widely studied model species Arabidopsis, a flowering Eurasian plant known as thale cress, confirming that they did, in fact, play a role in function such as managing the sun’s radiation and dealing with extreme temperatures.“It’s a mine, but it’s also a genetic goldmine,” said Gloria Coruzzi, a molecular biologist at New York University who helped sequence the plants’ genomes and co-authored the study, referring to the lithium and copper production in the region. “We’re extracting the genes that enable the plants to grow in that desperate environment.”The findings were not limited to genetics alone. The scientists also identified microbes in the soil that pulled nitrogen from the air into the soil, providing the scarce nutrient to the plants’ roots. At a time when scientists and Silicon Valley startups are seeking new ways to wean U.S. farmers off their addiction to nitrogen fertilizer, which pollutes water and produces large amounts of planet-heating gas.Those microbes, Coruzzi said, are the “ecological context of how these plants are growing,” a key detail as the soil microbiome is increasingly seen as “the future of plant agriculture.”About 44% of the world’s croplands are in drylands, ecosystems that include deserts, semi-deserts and grasslands, according to United Nations data. And many of the world’s deserts are growing as the planet warms and freshwater resources diminish. Africa’s Sahara, for example, has expanded by 10% since 1920, recent research found, threatening crop fields that feed a population that is expected to double by the middle of this century.The potential applications stretch beyond drought-resistant tomatoes or corn that requires far less nitrogen fertilizer. Protein sequences in grasses the scientists studied could be used to grow biofuel crops in soils too poor for vegetable farming. The U.S. Department of Energy gave the researchers $7 million to conduct the study for those purposes specifically. (The Chilean government also gave the project “substantial funding,” though the researchers declined to give an exact dollar figure.)To get a sense of just how rapidly lithium production in the Atacama has increased, you only need to look at satellite images of the desert’s biggest salt flat. In 1993, industry on the Salar de Atacama was confined to a tiny sliver of the nearly 1,200-square-mile flatland surrounded by mountains. By 2015, U.S. Geological Survey images show production sites had consumed a broad swath of the flat’s central zone.The expansion reflects growing demand overseas. While Australia, which mines lithium from hard rock and sends the raw material to China for processing, has in recent years become the world’s top supplier of the mineral, the Atacama remains a central node in a supply chain increasingly pulled taut as electric vehicle sales soar in East Asia, Europe, and North America.By 2040, the International Energy Agency predicts demand for lithium will be 42 times what it was in 2020.Lithium miners and vehicle battery manufacturers have long worried that the supply of the mineral would run short sometime in the next decade. But as sales have skyrocketed and commodity producers have struggled to keep up with post-pandemic supply orders, some have begun to warn that the lithium crunch could hit as soon as two years from now.After years of becoming cheaper by the month, battery prices last week slowed their steady descent for the first time.For environmental and indigenous activists in Chile, those concerns have been central as the country rewrites its constitution in a bid to restore balance power away from the corporations that have dominated society there since the reign of dictator Augusto Pinochet.“This report confirms these activists’ sentiments that there is a lot of value for humanity writ large in preserving the ecosystem and ensuring that extraction doesn’t take precedence over other land uses and livelihoods in the area,” said Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College who studies lithium mining and its impacts in Latin America. “The big story here is about the contradiction between local landscapes and the scientific value of them and extractive activities.”The study “highlights the importance of understanding and valuing local and endemic biodiversity,” said Cristina Dorador, a microbial ecologist at Chile’s Universidad de Antofagasta who was not involved in the paper but reviewed an advanced copy of the paper for HuffPost.“The fragile equilibrium of the Salar de Atacama and its surroundings is at risk due to massive scale of the proposed extraction,” said Dorador, who is also an activist working on the country’s new constitution.Juan Navedo, a researcher at the Universidad Austral de Chile, said “all food crops would benefit from knowledge about adaptations in vascular plants and associated soil microbiota” from the study, and warned that “once water has gone, restoration is unfeasible.”“These ecosystems must be untouchable if we are to survive as a civilization,” Navedo, who was not involved in the paper but reviewed it for HuffPost, wrote in an email. “These ecosystems and their associated biodiversity are unrepeatable.”Similar conflicts are brewing now in the United States, where demand for lithium and other raw materials for green technologies is driving a push to increase domestic mining. In Nevada, a proposed lithium mine has drawn heated opposition from Indigenous tribes, ranchers and botanists, who say the project threatens an ecologically and culturally precious area.Gutiérrez hopes his study could serve as a model for future ecosystem-wide research.“Most of what we know about biology comes from a very small number of organisms that we use in the labs, when there’s so much to know and learn from wild species in their environments,” he said. “If you’re going to start mining in a place and you don’t even know what’s there, we’ll have no idea what we’ve lost afterward.”"}, {"title": "Joe Biden Apologizes For Donald Trump In UN Climate Change Speech", "text": "Sometimes the path back to relevance starts with acknowledging your mistakes ― even if those mistakes were intentional and committed entirely by your predecessor.President Joe Biden is in Glasgow, Scotland, for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference this week, where he’s looking to reposition the United States as a dependable leader in the fight against climate change.His first order of business? Apologize for the last guy, who went out of his way to ignore science and make climate change worse.“I shouldn’t apologize, but I do apologize for the fact the United States, the last administration, pulled out of the Paris accords and put us sort of behind the eight ball a little bit,” Biden told world leaders on Monday.“Behind the eight ball” is a severe understatement.As president, Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, a landmark deal the U.S. took a lead in brokering. The deal seeks to cut planet-heating emissions and includes virtually every nation as a signatory. Even the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, a massive global oil company, thought leaving the deal was a dumb move.Back home, Trump repeatedly targeted the Clean Air Act, sought to roll back decades of Clean Water Act protections, and actively tried to bury climate science reports that didn’t fit his narrative. He also lied constantly about all of that, often claiming to be doing the opposite.Science was never Trump’s strong suit. He had virtually no science advisers on staff, dismissed “Global Waming [sic]” as a “Chinese hoax” because it was cold in the Midwest once, infamously doctored a hurricane forecast with a Sharpie in an attempt to save face, and, in the face of a deadly global pandemic, repeatedly doled out harmful and counterproductive advice even as he privately knew better, leading to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths."}, {"title": "Biden Wants U.S. To Lead Climate Efforts", "text": ""}, {"title": "Biden Says U.S. Will Lead During 'Decisive Decade' For Climate", "text": "Noting that climate change is already “destroying people’s lives and livelihoods,” U.S. President Joe Biden told world leaders at the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday that they can count on the United States to once again spearhead the fight against the environmental crisis.“We will demonstrate to the world that the United States is not only back at the table, but hopefully leading by the power of our example,” Biden said. “I know it hasn’t been the case. That’s why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action — not words.”It was an unmistakable reference to former President Donald Trump, who walked away from the country’s global commitments when he withdrew the United States from the historic Paris climate accord and worked to boost oil and gas production amid a crisis fueled by the world’s addiction to fossil fuels.Biden described the next 10 years as “a decisive decade” for confronting the threat of climate change and its mounting, interlocking effects.“Glasgow must be the kickoff of a decade of innovation and ambition to preserve our shared future,” he said.“Will we act? Will we do what is necessary? Will we seize the enormous opportunity before us? Or will we condemn future generations to suffer? This is the decade that will determine the answer.”World leaders are gathered in Glasgow for COP26, the largest annual international climate conference, where they hope to chart a course for rapidly reining in greenhouse gas emissions and slowing climate change before many of its consequences become irreversible. The event was delayed a full year due to the coronavirus pandemic.Alok Sharma, a British politician and president of the summit, called the gathering the world’s “last best hope” to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial levels.“The lights are flashing red on the climate dashboard,” Sharma said at the conference’s opening ceremony Sunday.Ahead of Biden’s speech, the White House unveiled its strategy for slashing carbon emissions at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and achieving net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. It also announced plans for a new program, which would require congressional approval, to provide $3 billion annually to assist developing countries with climate adaptation.Biden touted those actions, as well as the $550 billion in climate funding included in Democrats’ $1.75 trillion framework for a now scaled-down budget bill.“My Build Back Better framework will make historic investments in clean energy — the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis that any advanced nation has made, ever,” he said.But while Democrats and Republicans in Congress have struck a deal on the spending bill, they have yet to vote on it. And Biden arrived at the UN conference with a far shorter list of climate wins than he’d hoped for — a reality that many fear will undermine the administration’s efforts to persuade other countries to strengthen their commitments.With Congress slow to act, environmental groups have renewed calls for Biden to use his executive powers to transition the country away from planet-warming fossil fuels, including by stopping approvals of new pipeline and other oil and gas projects, halting federal fossil fuel leasing and reinstating a ban on crude oil exports.“In an age where this pandemic has made so painfully clear that no nation can wall itself off from borderless threats, we know none of us can escape the worst that is yet to come if we fail to seize this moment,” Biden said Monday. “We’re standing at an inflection point in world history. We have the ability to invest in ourselves and build an equitable clean energy future, and in the process create millions of good-paying jobs and opportunities around the world.”Biden acknowledged the United States’ outsized role in contributing to the crisis, as well as its responsibility to help solve the problem.“Those of us who are responsible for much of the deforestation, and all the problems we have so far, have an overwhelming obligation to the nations that have not,” he said. “We have to help, much more than we have thus far.”"}, {"title": "What Happens In Glasgow Could Set A Course Away From Climate Calamity — Or Cement A Disaster", "text": "In December 2015, negotiators struck a deal in the French capital that had eluded the world for more than two decades. The Paris Agreement became the first global pact with the United States and China ― the world’s two great carbon superpowers ― to recognize the threat emissions pose to life on Earth and pledge to stop the damage.Then chaos broke out. Exactly a year later, the United States, the world’s biggest cumulative source of emissions, elected a fossil fuel diehard in Donald Trump who quickly made his country the only one to withdraw from the accord. Jair Bolsonaro forged a similar path upon his election in Brazil, steward of the world’s largest rainforest, ramping up deforestation at a clip that tilted the scales for the first time toward more carbon-spewing in the Amazon than its canopy of leaves could absorb. China, the world’s largest annual emitter, initially canceled coal plants in droves, only to resume construction after a few years.The latest review of the most up-to-date and trusted research available by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s premier climate science body, led the U.N. secretary-general to warn that we have reached “code red for humanity” as carbon, methane and other heat-trapping gases so thicken in the atmosphere that the changes to our planet’s ecosystems are on the brink of becoming irreversible.And now the world will convene again, in Glasgow, Scotland, to confront this existential emergency.The U.S. has rejoined the Paris Agreement and, with the potential passage of the Build Back Better legislation as soon as next week, could set the stage for a clean-energy spending blitz. But America’s powerful fossil fuel industry has successfully torpedoed even modest policies put forward to wean the country off gas and oil, and just last week, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court agreed to consider limiting the federal government’s power to regulate greenhouse gases.India, now No. 3 in global emissions, has made huge investments in renewable energy but has balked at demands to do more to eliminate pollution. China, meanwhile, has closed its purse to overseas coal projects, only to ramp up production at home amid a global energy crunch.This was always set to be the most important climate summit since that fateful meeting in 2015. Anticipating the pact as a turning point in national energy policies, the Paris Agreement stipulated that, after five years, the negotiators would gather at the annual United Nations-run conference to reassess and strengthen the carbon-cutting targets. (In a sign of how interconnected and fragile the global system has become, the worst pandemic in over a century delayed the confab by a year.)The Paris Agreement set a goal of keeping global temperatures from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial averages. A Glasgow pact was supposed to get the world over the finish line to the Paris Agreement’s secondary target of capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, the level at which island nations imperiled by rising seas could see some hope of survival.Yet “1.5 to stay alive,” the slogan campaigners chanted in 2015, has now morphed into the more desperate “keep 1.5 alive.”Emissions dipped abruptly last year as the coronavirus pandemic idled cars and factories worldwide. But despite promises to “green” the recovery, hastily restoring economic output took precedence in most countries, sending emissions soaring yet again this year. And ― even though the Paris Agreement is not legally binding, and therefore there is little to no recourse to punish nations that fail to comply with their stated goals ― the vast majority of countries are not even pretending to set a course to keep warming within 1.5 degrees.To hit that target, the world needs to phase out unabated coal plants five times faster than it does today and phase in low-emissions fuels 12 times faster, according to an analysis by the group Climate Action Tracker. Both annual tree planting and restoration of coastal wetlands need to increase by a factor of three. Of the 40 indicators of climate progress the nonprofit analyzed, none were keeping pace with the emissions cuts needed to halt the rise in global temperatures.Now the world finds itself at an inflection point. The uptick in economic activity has created demand that outstrips the supply of many raw materials, from natural gas to wood, that power the engines of global commerce, causing price spikes and blackouts across the world. The utopian visions environmentalists once painted now look more naive by the day as decarbonization demands more energy than ever and nuclear power plants ― once the scourge of green groups ― increasingly feature in countries’ plans to cut emissions.At the same time, the choir of voices seeking to maintain our economic status quo, from fossil fuel stalwarts to Ayn Randian corporate titans, have harmonized their calls cautioning against more government intervention to reduce both pollution and wealth concentrations.But the seductive calls to focus on short-term costs belie just how warped the balance sheet has become. In real money terms, the cost of failing to keep warming in check stretches quantifiability, but estimates suggest tens of trillions of dollars. There are more immediate costs: Billion-dollar wildfires and hurricanes mounting by the year, millions of people displaced from their homes and kept in precarious camps, and an infrastructure backlog that, as destruction spreads, require repairs on top of upgrades on top of complete overhauls.Economic damages, of course, can never capture the human misery caused by what would likely be tens of millions more deaths, as well as births that never materialize as failed crops beget famine, as extreme weather drowns, roasts and pulverizes people, and as mass migrations amid scarcer resources trigger more bloody conflict.Then there’s the matter of atmospheric accounting. The Earth’s gaseous outer layers can only hold so much CO2 before 1.5 degrees is guaranteed. This metric, known as the carbon budget, is dangerously close to meeting its limit. As of 2020, humanity could produce another 400 billion metric tons of carbon before blowing past the temperature target. At a current rate of about 42 billion metric tons per year, the world has a little over seven and a half years left to slash carbon pollution and balance the books with carbon removal, according to Germany’s Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change.Failure to mitigate those risks with emissions cuts does not foreclose on a less apocalyptic outcome. But it does force humanity to rely on riskier methods of maintaining some semblance of today’s world. A report from the White House’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence last week warned that keeping warming in check increasingly relies on technology that, in theory, could vacuum the carbon dioxide mess from the sky, if it ever becomes cheap and efficient enough.In the meantime, the chance that a country suffering from heat may go rogue and attempt to dim the sun with aerosols that mimic the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption increases every year along with emissions. The world, the report concludes, is woefully unprepared for any such scenario.Glasgow may prove a turning point. Or it could prove to be a 12-day demonstration that the world can’t, or won’t, fend off coming disaster. Either way, there is no straight path anymore."}, {"title": "World Leaders Make Mild Pledges On Climate Neutrality, Coal Financing At G-20", "text": "ROME (AP) — Leaders of the world’s biggest economies agreed Sunday to stop funding coal-fired power plants in poor countries and made a vague commitment to seek carbon neutrality “by or around mid-century” as they wrapped up a Rome summit before the much larger United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.While Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and French President Emmanuel Macron described the Group of 20 summit as a success, the outcome disappointed climate activists, the chief of the U.N. and Britain’s leader. The U.K. is hosting the two-week Glasgow conference and had looked for more ambitious targets to come out of Rome.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the G-20′s commitments mere “drops in a rapidly warming ocean.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed the outcome was not enough.“While I welcome the #G20′s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled — but at least they are not buried,” Guterres tweeted. “Onwards to #COP26 in Glasgow.”The G-20 countries represent more than three-quarters of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and Britain had hoped for a “G-20 bounce” going into the Glasgow COP26 meeting. Environmentalists and scientists have described the U.N. conference as the world’s “last best hope” for nailing down commitments to limit the global rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average.The summit laid bare the divisions that still exist between Western countries that polluted the planet the most historically but are now seeing emissions decline and the emerging economies led by China whose emissions are rising as their economies grow.Britain pushed for a commitment to achieve climate neutrality or net-zero emissions, meaning a balance between greenhouse gases added to and removed from the atmosphere, by 2050.The United States and the European Union have set 2050 as their own deadline for reaching net-zero emissions, while China, Russia and Saudi Arabia are aiming for 2060. The leaders of those three countries didn’t come to Rome for the summit.In the end, the G-20 leaders arrived at a compromise to achieve climate neutrality “by or around mid-century,” not a set year.Before leaving Rome, U.S. President Joe Biden called it “disappointing’ that G-20 members Russia and China ’basically didn’t show up” with commitments to address the scourge of climate change ahead of the U.N. climate conference.Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are not expected to attend the conference in Glasgow, although they are sending senior officials to the international COP26 talks.“The disappointment relates to the fact that Russia...and China basically didn’t show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change. And there’s a reason why people should be disappointed,” Biden said, adding: “I found it disappointing myself.”Biden comments came in response to a reporter’s question about the modest pledges made during the G-20 summit.“We made commitments here from across the board in terms of what we’re going to bring to (COP26),” the president said. “As that old trade saying goes, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.”Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pushed back at the West’s target date.“Why do you believe 2050 is some magic figure?” Lavrov asked at a news conference. “If it is an ambition of the European Union, it is the right of other countries also to have ambitions....No one has proven to us or anybody else that 2050 is something everyone must subscribe to.”Italy’s Draghi said the declaration went further on climate than any G-20 statement before it. He noted that it referred to keeping the 1.5-degree global warming target within reach, something that science shows will be hard to accomplish unless the world dramatically cuts emissions from fossil fuels.“We changed the goalposts,” Draghi told reporters.Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau said that G-20 leaders were able to get together was in itself a success given the coronavirus pandemic.“The fact that we have well laid out the table and know where the sharp edges are, and know what work we we’re going to have to do at COP… is a very positive step,” Trudeau said.The future of coal, a key source of greenhouse gas emissions, also proved one of the most difficult issues on which to find consensus for the G-20.At the Rome summit, leaders agreed to “put an end to the provision of international public finance for new unabated coal power generation abroad by the end of 2021.” That refers to financial support for building coal plants abroad.Western countries have been moving away from such financing and major Asian economies are following suit: Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at the U.N. General Assembly last month that Beijing would stop funding such projects, and Japan and South Korea made similar commitments earlier in the year.China has not set an end date for building coal plants at home, however. Coal is still China’s main source of power generation, and both China and India have resisted proposals for a G-20 declaration on phasing out domestic coal consumption.The failure of the G-20 to set a target for phasing out domestic coal use was a disappointment to Britain. But Johnson’s spokesperson, Max Blain, said the G-20 communique “was never meant to be the main lever in order to secure commitments on climate change,” noting those would be hammered out at the Glasgow summit.John Kirton, director of the G-20 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said the leaders “took only baby steps” in the agreement and did almost nothing new.He pointed to the agreement to “recall and reaffirm” their overdue commitment to provide $100 billion in assistance to poorer countries and to “stress the importance of meeting that goal fully as soon as possible” instead of stating that they were ready to stump up the full amount.The agreement to end international coal financing “is the one thing that’s specific and real. That one counts,” Kirton said.Youth climate activists Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate issued an open letter to the media as the G-20 was wrapping up, stressing three fundamental aspects of the climate crisis that often are downplayed: that time is running out, that any solution must provide justice to the people most affected, and that the biggest polluters often hide behind incomplete statistics about their true emissions.“The climate crisis is only going to become more urgent. We can still avoid the worst consequences, we can still turn this around. But not if we continue like today,” they wrote, just weeks after Thunberg shamed global leaders for their “blah blah blah” rhetoric during a youth climate summit in Milan.Greenpeace Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said the G-20 failed to provide the leadership the world needed. “I think it was a betrayal to young people around the world,” she told The Associated Press on Sunday.Aside from climate issues, the leaders signed off on a landmark agreement for countries to enact a global minimum corporate tax of 15%. The global minimum is aimed at deterring multinational companies from dodging taxes by shifting profits to countries with ultra-low rates where they may do little actual business.The leaders also said they would continue work on a French initiative for wealthier countries to re-channel $100 billion in financial support to needier countries in Africa in the form of special drawing rights - a foreign exchange tool used to help finance imports allocated by the International Monetary Fund and also received by advanced countries.The leaders said they were “working on actionable options” to do that and set the $100 billion figure as a “total global ambition” short of an absolute commitment. Some $45 billion has already been reallocated by individual countries on a voluntary basis.The commitment reflects concern that the post-pandemic recovery is diverging, with wealthy countries rebounding faster due to extensive vaccinations and stimulus spending.___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless and Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report.

It would, however, restrict the legal routes through the Clean Air Act for enacting such rules. That could make it harder for the United States to hit its goal to cut emissions in half by the end of this decade.In an updated grant of certiorari, the Supreme Court said it plans to ask questions about a legal issue known as “non-delegation doctrine,” which Cornell Law School describes as the “principle in administrative law that Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to other entities.”A ruling that explicitly requires Congress to pass new laws allowing EPA to regulate carbon emissions could prove an even bigger setback.The White House abandoned its main legislative proposal to pay utilities to produce more zero-carbon electricity, and fine those that fail to increase their clean output each year, after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said he’d torpedo the administration’s agenda if Democrats included the measure in a sweeping spending bill currently under consideration. Democrats are also expected to lose control of Congress in next year’s election.At issue is a legal snafu from 1990, when then-President George H.W. Bush mistakenly signed two slightly differing versions of the Clean Air Act into law, creating legal confusion over the line between federal and state power when it came to regulating greenhouse gases.When it proposed its Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration was relying on the version of the law interpreted to give agencies more authority. In February 2016, the Supreme Court zeroed in on the legal ambiguity around the statute known as Section 111(D) to issue a temporary pause on implementing the regulation. Before the White House could resolve the issue, Donald Trump became president, and put Scott Pruitt — the former Oklahoma attorney general who led the lawsuit that resulted in the stay against the Clean Power Plan — in charge of the EPA. The Clean Power Plan was scrapped soon after.Shortly before President Joe Biden was inaugurated, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit determined that the Clean Power Plan was legally sound, tossing out the much weaker regulation the Trump administration proposed to replace it.The Biden administration is still working on a number of regulations aimed at cutting emissions, and none so far rely on the already-contentious Section 111(D).“It’s only this one statute of the Clean Air Act, which is one of many tools the administration has,” Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center on Climate Change Law, told HuffPost. “I don’t think it’s a problem for most of the measures the administration might want. But there’s this one particular tool that might be in trouble.”The court could, however, seek to “take this as an opportunity to rule more broadly about the ability of Congress to delegate decisions to agencies,” by going after the non-delegation doctrine, and might “say Congress is going to have to give EPA authority over such an important area and be more clear and explicit.”That would likely constitute a victory for the plaintiffs. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, Democrats need to vote in lockstep to pass a bill, giving unique power to lone senators like Manchin, whose opposition to climate regulations and personal family fortune tied up in a coal business have made him a magnet for fossil fuel industry donations throughout the past year. He’d be unlikely to vote for legislation granting the EPA new powers to regulate greenhouse gases. And Republicans are favored to win back at least one chamber of Congress in next year’s midterm election.“As a practical matter, this will almost certainly prevent the Biden Administration from moving forward with a new rule to regulate carbon emissions from the power sector,” Jeff Holmstead, a George W. Bush-era EPA air administrator who now works at the energy lobbying firm Bracewell, said in an emailed statement calling the decision a “huge deal ― and a big surprise.”“They’ll have to wait to see what the Supreme Court says about how (and whether) they can regulate carbon emissions from the power sector under current law,” he added.The Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the more powerful and well-funded environmental litigators, vowed Friday to fight the cases at the Supreme Court.“Coal companies and their state allies are asking the Court to strip EPA of any authority under the Clean Air Act to meaningfully reduce the nearly 1.5 billion tons of carbon pollution spewed from the nation’s power plants each year – authority the Court has upheld three times in the past two decades,” David Doniger, senior strategic director of the NRDC’s climate and clean energy program, said in a statement. “We will vigorously defend EPA’s authority to curb power plants’ huge contribution to the climate crisis.”West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who signed onto the legal petition, called the court’s decision to hear the case the “biggest Supreme Court news since our win in Feb of 2016.”“We must not allow Biden’s EPA to impose unlawful climate regs on our nation,” he wrote in a tweet.Biden’s efforts to rein in U.S. emissions have already faced challenges from the federal judiciary, which is now stacked with judges Trump appointed. In June, Judge Terry Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, a Trump appointee, issued a ruling lifting the White House’s pause on leasing federal land to oil and gas companies. Biden’s Department of the Interior is now set to auction off about 80 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico to drillers on Nov. 17, just five days after the U.N. climate summit comes to a close."}, {"title": "California Condors Can Have 'Virgin Births': Study", "text": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — Endangered California condors can have “’virgin births,” according to a study released Thursday.Researchers with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance said genetic testing confirmed that two male chicks hatched in 2001 and 2009 from unfertilized eggs were related to their mothers. Neither was related to a male.The study was published Thursday in the the Journal of Heredity. It’s the first report of asexual reproduction in California condors, although parthenogenesis can occur in other species ranging from sharks to honey bees to Komodo dragons.But in birds, it usually only occurs when females don’t have access to males. In this case, each mother condor had previously bred with males, producing 34 chicks, and each was housed with a fertile male at the time they produced the eggs through parthenogenesis.The researchers said they believe it is the first case of asexual reproduction in any avian species where the female had access to a mate.“These findings now raise questions about whether this might occur undetected in other species,” said Oliver Ryder, the study’s co-author and director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.The non-profit alliance runs the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park and has been involved in a California condor breeding program that helped bring the giant vultures back from near-extinction.With 10-foot (3-meter) wingspans, California condors are the largest flying birds in North America. They once ranged throughout the West Coast. But only 22 survived in the 1980s when the U.S. government captured them and placed them in zoos for captive breeding. About 160 were bred at the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park.There are now more than 500 California condors, including more than 300 that have been released into the wild in California, Arizona, Utah and Mexico.The asexual reproduction was discovered some years ago during widespread testing of genetic material collected over decades from condors, both living and dead, in breeding programs and in the wild.“Among 467 male California condors tested in the parentage analysis, no male qualified as a potential sire” of the two birds, the study said.California condors can live up to 60 years, but both males were sickly. One was less than 2 years old when he died, and the other lived less than eight years."}, {"title": "Historic Hearing On Big Oil's Climate Denial Features... More Industry Denial", "text": "A landmark congressional hearing to probe the extent to which the oil industry misled the public about global climate change featured executives of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies and industry trade groups further downplaying climate science.“We know the combustion of oil and gas releases greenhouse gases,” Darren Woods, CEO of oil giant ExxonMobil, told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform before misrepresenting the findings of the world’s leading climate science body.“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” he said, “has concluded that increased greenhouse gases can contribute to climate change.”What the United Nations scientific body actually concluded in an August report is that human activity — namely the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation — is the ”unequivocal” cause of climate change, and has already unleashed devastating changes around the globe.Other industry executives rolled out similarly couched talking points.“We accept the scientific consensus: Climate change is real and the use of fossil fuels contributes to it,” said Chevron CEO Michael Wirth.“Climate change is real. Industrial activity contributes to it,” said Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the oil and gas industry trade group that’s played an outsized role in sowing doubt about human-caused climate change and fighting efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.“The climate is changing and humans are contributing to those changes,” said Suzanne Clark, CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has also spent years funding climate misinformation campaigns.Such statements might have flown in the 1990s. In 2021, it is outright climate denial. The science is unequivocal: Fossil fuels aren’t just one of many contributors to global warming, but the primary cause of the rapidly worsening crisis.The highly anticipated hearing marked the first time that oil industry executives have appeared before Congress to answer questions under oath about the industry’s role in spreading climate misinformation. Even before it started, Democrats were comparing the moment to a 1994 hearing in which executives of the largest tobacco companies testified that cigarettes and nicotine are not addictive.“Twenty-seven years ago, seven tobacco executives appeared in this room before Congress,” Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), the chairwoman of the committee, said in her opening remarks. “Rather than admitting the truth about their product, the executives lied. This was a watershed moment in the public’s understanding of Big Tobacco. I hope that today’s hearing represents a turning point for Big Oil. I hope that today the witnesses will finally own up to the industry’s central role in this crisis and become part of the change we need.”Executives flatly denied that their companies ever participated in an effort to downplay or dismiss the climate threat, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.“While our views on climate change have developed over time, any suggestion that Chevron has engaged in an effort to spread disinformation and mislead the public on these complex issues is simply wrong,” Chevron CEO Michael Wirth told lawmakers.“Exxon does not, and never has, spread disinformation regarding climate change,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said.An InsideClimate News investigation in 2015 revealed that top executives at Exxon knew about the role of fossil fuels in global warming as early as 1977, then lobbied against efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon has donated millions to groups that deny anthropogenic climate change. It and Chevron are both members of API, which knew about the threat in the early 1980s but worked to cover up and downplay it. Wirth sits on the board of API, which continues working to block climate action.Maloney questioned Woods about statements that former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond made in the mid-1990s, including that the “the case for so-called global warming is far from air tight.” Nearly 20 years earlier, an Exxon scientist name James Black wrote in an internal memo that “there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels.”Maloney asked Woods if he agreed that there are inconsistencies between statements from Exxon executives and its own scientists. Woods said he did not agree and that Exxon’s position “has continued to evolve with the scientific community.”“I was hoping that you would not be like the tobacco industry was and lie about this,” Maloney told Woods. “I was hoping that you would be better than the tobacco industry and that you would have come out with the truth, and I’m disappointed with the statement that you made.”Executives from BP and Shell also testified at Thursday’s hearing. None of the industry representatives would commit when Maloney called on them to pledge to no longer direct funds to efforts aimed at obstructing climate initiatives.Meanwhile, Republican after Republican used their allotted time on Thursday to defend the oil executives, apologizing for what they described as Democrats’ efforts to “intimidate,” “badger” and “demonize” the industry. And they argued that the committee would be better off spending its time investigating something — anything — else: inflation, rising gas prices, immigration, the Afghanistan withdrawal, the pandemic.“It is clear that this hearing is part of a Democrat-led disinformation campaign to distract from the Biden administration’s failed policies that are hurting average Americans,” Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) said.As Republicans worked to shift the focus of the hearing away from big oil’s record of pollution and climate denial, Democrats dug in.“I think one thing that often gets lost in these conversations is that some of us have to actually live the future that you all are setting on fire,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said. “By 2028, crop yields are already projected to begin to fail, with famine beginning to hit the world’s most vulnerable populations. By 2038, current U.S. drought, fire and extreme heat trends could potentially make whole regions of the United States unlivable if we continue the trends that lobbyists are trying to have us pursue.”“We do not have the privilege or luxury of lobbyist spin,” she added.Democratic committee members had requested that companies turn over internal documents related to the industry’s role in misleading the public. Unsatisfied with what the companies provided, Maloney announced at the end of Thursday’s that she plans to subpoena them.“I do not take this step lightly,” Maloney said. “We are at code red for climate and I am committed to doing everything I can to help rescue this planet and save it for our children. We need to get to the bottom of the oil industry’s disinformation campaign, and with these subpoenas we will.”"}, {"title": "Biden's Budget Chief Defends Pared-Down Agenda: 'This Is How The Sausage Gets Made'", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden’s top budget official defended the slimmed-down deal on infrastructure this week, explaining that the weeks of bristling negotiations is how the “sausage-making” happens.“This is, in my estimation, my experience, just what the legislative process is,” acting Budget Director Shalanda Young told HuffPost of the diminished climate proposals in the package. “And frankly, a lot of Americans said they want to see the sausage-making up close and personal. This is it. This is how it happens.”The deal is far smaller than what Democratic lawmakers were pulling for and removes several key proposals like paid family leave and sick leave programs and lower pharmaceutical drug prices. Democrats dropped the paid leave program after failing to convince Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to support it, meaning the United States remains one of the only industrialized countries in the world with a paid leave mandate. And leaving prescription drug reform out of the package could end up a cudgel for former President Donald Trump, who attempted to take executive action on the price of drugs during his tenure.But the bill includes $550 billion in clean energy and climate funding in what Biden called “the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis ever ... beyond any other advanced nation in the world.”However, experts believe the package is still not enough to bring U.S. emissions to zero and prevent millions of deaths as the planet warms. A United Nations report from August found that it is “unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” and that things will only get worse. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s findings a “code red for humanity.”It’s still unclear how much of the funding will go toward the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative, announced in January. The initiative seeks to deliver at least 40% of federal investments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. A 2017 report found that Black Americans are 75% more likely to live near pollution sources than other Americans.In an interview this week, Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, urged patience as progressives voiced concern over the pared-down agenda.“In some ways, I watch and just recognize that people don’t fully understand how the process works. We are moving extraordinarily quickly on lots of things,” she explained. “It’s just that the things we are trying to do are huge, and the ability to be able to kind of move the entire federal government in a way that we’re able to deliver on Justice40 is a big ask and it takes multiple steps.”“I just ask people to give us a little bit of time to make it all come together,” she added."}, {"title": "Biden Reaches $550 Billion Climate Compromise Days Before Major UN Summit", "text": "Just a week after fossil fuel stalwarts in his own party killed his signature carbon-cutting proposal, President Joe Biden announced Thursday a compromise package that, if passed, would mark by far the biggest climate investment in U.S. history.The proposal directs $550 billion of Democrats’ $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act toward the nation’s buildout of zero-carbon electricity, electric vehicles and pollution cleanups.In a speech Thursday afternoon, Biden called the framework “the most significant investment to deal with the climate crisis [to have] ever, ever happened ― beyond any other advanced nation in the world.”“Over a billion metric tons of emissions reductions ― at least 10 times bigger on climate than any bill that has ever passed before and enough to position us for a 50 to 52% emissions reductions by the year 2030,” he said. “And we’ll do it in ways that grow the domestic industries, create good-paying union jobs, and address longstanding environmental injustices, as well.”On a dollar-for-dollar basis, the plan dwarfs the last major federal climate investment, a $90 billion package then-President Barack Obama won in 2009, and gives the White House leverage to demand that the rest of the world take drastic action to curb climate-changing pollution when the president arrives next week in Glasgow, Scotland, for the big United Nations climate summit.But the package falls far short of what scientists and economists from across the ideological spectrum say is needed to transform the U.S. economy and keep warming from soaring to catastrophic levels. Coupled with a lackluster emissions-cutting pledge from China, the U.S. proposal stoked fears the world will fail to cut pollution fast enough to keep global temperatures from surging past 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, routinely causing trillions of dollars in damages and millions of early deaths.“It is easy to call this the biggest climate bill ever when the federal government has done so little to protect people from the unfolding crisis, and when our democracy is so polluted by the influence of fossil fuel lobbyists,” Janet Redman, Greenpeace USA’s climate campaign director, said in a statement. “The bar for action cannot be set by what pundits deem possible or by the accomplishments of past administrations — it must be set by science and justice.”The proposal, which is almost certain to receive zero votes from Republican lawmakers, will require every Democratic senator and virtually all House Democrats to become law. Progressives, who had wanted a $10 trillion plan in line with projections for what is needed for full decarbonization, have said they are waiting to see the final text of the legislation before guaranteeing their votes.The deal, according to a factsheet the White House published Thursday morning, includes about $320 billion in tax credits for companies that buy and build solar, wind and nuclear power, and for drivers who purchase electric vehicles. The program would last 10 years ― twice as long as previous clean energy tax credits.Another $105 billion would go to investments to fortify the country against extreme weather, clean up disease-causing chemicals in historically polluted communities, and set up a Civilian Climate Corps modeled on the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, which planted billions of trees and provided jobs during the Great Depression.The administration said it won $110 billion in targeted incentives to boost domestic manufacturing of clean energy products and baseline industrial goods such as cement and steel, which have struggled to compete with cheaper and often more polluting rivals overseas.The budget also includes $20 billion for the government itself to buy more green technologies, including small-modular nuclear reactors, which could have a knock-on effect of spurring on technologies that have had trouble finding private buyers.Nearly half the country’s emissions come from automobile tailpipes, office furnaces, and home stovetops, and eliminating that pollution means swapping those cars, heating and cooking systems for electric alternatives. Doing so, according to a 2018 study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, would increase U.S. electricity consumption by 40% over the next three decades.The investments in the White House’s budget deal will undoubtedly hasten the transition to electric vehicles and appliances, and increase the likelihood that zero-carbon sources make up a large portion of new power generation. But the U.S. had nearly 200 new gas-fired power plants under construction or in the permitting phase just two years ago, and the plan does little to explicitly limit fossil fuel use.That was by design. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a conservative Democrat from a major fossil fuel-producing state and whose family owns a coal business, balked at the regulatory program that was supposed to serve as the centerpiece of Biden’s climate strategy.The proposed Clean Electricity Performance Program would have given the Department of Energy $150 billion to pay utilities who increase their output of zero-carbon power by 4% each year ― and fine those that failed to hit that target.Just two utilities ― the municipally owned Orlando Utility Commission in Florida and Southern Indiana Gas & Electric ― were on track to meet that target, according to company data the advocacy groups Evergreen Action and Natural Resources Defense Council collected. That made the provision key to hitting emissions goals. Independent modelers projected the program would get the U.S. one-third of the way to its goal of cutting emissions in half by the end of this decade.Democrats managed to redistribute that funding to other programs, delivering a much bigger tax credit suite than previously planned. That’s a lot of carrots. And the administration has vowed to compensate for the loss of the program by enacting new regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency, restoring the federal government’s stick.A new analysis by the Rhodium Group, a consultancy firm, found that the mix of funding and executive branch actions could, technically, deliver the emissions cuts Biden promised. (New modeling from independent consultancies that includes the beefed-up spending on tax credits and other climate provisions is expected in the coming days).The implementation of the climate plan comes with big ifs. Regulations will take years to come into force, and will likely face hefty legal challenges like the ones that met the Obama administration’s proposed rules after the 44th president similarly failed to codify a decarbonization plan into law through Congress. Unlike then, the federal judiciary is now stacked with judges former President Donald Trump, a fossil fuel hardliner, named to the bench, and conservatives enjoy a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. And if Biden, already the oldest person to assume the presidency, is defeated in 2024, the next administration could reverse the regulatory and executive actions almost as easily as the current White House enacted them.The Biden administration already received a taste of that reality in June. Shortly after fulfilling a campaign promise to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands, Judge Terry Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, a Trump appointee, issued a ruling lifting the temporary leasing halt.On Nov. 17, just five days after the U.N. climate summit is scheduled to end, Biden’s Department of the Interior is set to auction some 80 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drillers."}, {"title": "Eco-Friendly Artificial Christmas Trees To Order Now", "text": "It’s evident now more than ever how our consumer choices and lifestyle decisions have significant and lingering effects on the planet and the precarious ecological system on which we depend. Images of oceans packed with more plastic than fish, communities devastated by natural disasters and landscapes scorched by record temperatures are visual representations of action and reaction.Everything down to the type of artificial Christmas tree we choose has a resounding impact on how hospitable the world of tomorrow will be, which makes “eco-fying” one of your most beloved holiday traditions not only worth it, but imperative.“Artificial Christmas trees are commonly made from PVC or polyethylene plastics and imported from China or South Korea,” explained Emily Fletcher, a sustainability expert and founder of the Australian Clean + Conscious Awards. “Both of these plastics are derived from petrochemicals and create huge greenhouse gas emissions in their manufacture.”While it’s nearly impossible to find artificial Christmas trees that are not made from PVC or some kind of polyethylene plastics, there are some made from recycled PVC, which is a much better option if you’re buying your first artificial tree or replacing one that’s busted.“Depending on what the artificial Christmas tree is made and sourced from, it has the potential to be one of the most sustainable products,” said Matt Bertulli, a longtime waste management advocate and the CEO of Pela, an international sustainability company that makes everyday products out of everyday waste. “By purchasing one artificial tree made of sustainable products and materials, you are drastically reducing harmful products from being thrown into the environment.”Robert Gibson, a professor at the school of environment, resources and sustainability at the University of Waterloo in Canada, told HuffPost it’s crucial to consider “the full life cycle of the products involved. For an artificial tree, that includes the effects of extracting the materials, manufacturing, transporting, using, storing, recycling or disposing.”Although artificial trees made in the U.S.A. are very few and far between, Gibson’s words suggest that locally made trees, which likely haven’t used as much fossil fuel to arrive at your doorstep, are worth the effort in the long run if you can find one. Buying domestic can also help prevent you from experiencing the host of global supply issues that are having a huge impact on the artificial tree industry.That said, the use that you get out of the tree is perhaps the most critical factor.“The idea behind using an artificial tree is that it will be used repeatedly and therefore save a living tree from being cut down and subsequently heading to landfill just a few weeks later,” Fletcher said. “So, if you’re doing an artificial tree, the most important factor in its sustainability is to use it for as many years as possible.”Take a look at some of the artificial Christmas trees on the more sustainable side below for an earth-conscious Christmas.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Conservationists Say Yes.", "text": "The pekapeka-tou-roa, New Zealand’s long-tailed bat, is special for many reasons.Bats are the island nation’s only native land mammal and the pekapeka-tou-roa is just one of two surviving species in the country. Weighing about as much as a large grape, the winged creatures have disappeared from much of their traditional habitat and drawn fierce calls for their protection.But one thing the pekapeka-tou-roa is not is a bird.That’s the rub for the country’s Bird of the Year contest for 2021, which for the first time in its 16-year history included this bat. The annual competition, which highlights iconic, winged Kiwi species, seemed like the right fit to give the pekapeka (the Māori word for bat) some room to soar.Laura Keown, a spokesperson for the contest, said the critically endangered mammals were included amid ongoing concerns about their conservation status.“Since ‘mammal of the year’ was going to be a very boring competition we kind of decided to throw the bat among the pigeons and ruffle some feathers,” Keown said. “We’ve got these critically endangered bats, they only come out a night … they’re silent, they’re quite invisible to people, sometimes they can live adjacent to cities and people often don’t even know they’re there.”“It’s been an idea that has been floating so we thought maybe the bats deserved a bit of attention,” she added.The contest is run by Forest and Bird, a leading Kiwi conservation group, and involves a public vote on the internet. Past winners include the kākāpō, a type of green parrot that once tried to mate with a man’s head on the BBC, and the yellow-eyed penguin.Like many of New Zealand’s native species, bats are extremely vulnerable to introduced predators like possums, stoats and rats, Keown said. Conservationists have long said these bats deserve similar attention afforded to emblematic bird species that also face extinction.“Our bats and birds have both really taken a knock,” she said, noting young bats can often get “eaten while they sleep.” The other primary threat is ongoing habitat loss. About 75% of the country’s native forests have been destroyed since humans first came to the country.“They love old trees, 100 years old and older, that’s where they have their roosts,” Keown said. “When the forests are lost, really a new regenerating forest isn’t a good habitat. They need those big old trees.”Keown said the bats’ inclusion in the contest has largely been well-received by the Kiwi population, who take great joy in celebrating the country’s threatened species. Some sticks in the mud, however, have been a little more perturbed.“I like to say that birds can be very territorial so they don’t want to see a mammal crowding out the attention that goes to the attention of our amazing native birds every year,” she said. “Hopefully they’ll come around to the view that protecting bats by protecting native forests also protects our birds.”“Bats, birds and people, we’re all in it together,” she added.The contest ends at 5 p.m. local time on October 31."}, {"title": "5 Young Activists On Hunger Strike Demand Democrats Not Cut Back On Climate In Bill", "text": "Five young activists have been fasting outside the White House for more than a week, using their hunger strike to demand that President Joe Biden keep his promises on climate change action.“We’ve committed to not eating until you deliver on your climate commitments in the Build Back Better Act,” the Sunrise Movement activists — Kidus Girma, 26, Paul Campion, 24, Ema Govea, 18, Julia Paramo, 24, and Abby Leedy, 20 — wrote Tuesday in a letter to the White House, which was provided to HuffPost.Leedy, who has been fasting alongside the others since Oct. 20, said that they feel “not great,” with a lot of fatigue, stomach pain, and muscle and joint aches.The five take their blood pressure three times a day, and Girma was hospitalized overnight Saturday for nausea, dizziness and blurred vision but then returned to the strike. Outside the White House, they sit in wheelchairs because they cannot walk alone for long without the risk of falling or fainting from weakness.An unknown number of other people are also fasting in solidarity with the hunger strikers.The climate change activists are demanding that Democrats help pass “the full scope” of the bill, including measures to reduce emissions at least 50% by 2030, as Biden had pledged.“Millions of people are going to die if they don’t do this — people our age, in our lifetimes, in climate disasters, in floods, fires and hurricanes, of starvation,” Leedy told HuffPost by phone Wednesday.“We want Joe Biden and the Democrats to look us in the face, as real people going through the horrific experience of starving and withering away before their eyes, because that’s what’s on the line here, people’s bodies and people’s lives,” she added. “I don’t think we knew how else to get their attention.”In their letter, the five ask that the president “stand up to Joe Manchin,” the Democratic senator from West Virginia, who has been an obstacle to several of Biden’s and progressive lawmakers’ more ambitious proposals.Manchin, whose home state and personal wealth rely on the coal industry, effectively blocked the president’s clean electricity program from the package. The program would pay power companies to replace coal and gas plants with renewables and retrofit them with carbon-capture technology or pay fines.The White House and Manchin did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.At a White House news conference Wednesday, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked for the president’s response to the hunger strikers, who believe the spending bill is being too watered down on climate.“Biden admires the activism,” Psaki said of the strikers, and defended the bill as it stands amid negotiations as “the biggest investment to addressing the climate crisis in U.S. history.”Campion, one of the hunger strikers, responded on Twitter: “We don’t want your admiration. Show us the results.”Leedy echoed the sentiment, saying that, though the bill as it stands may be historic, “it is not enough.”They plan to continue fasting “until it is clear Biden has used all of his powers as president to get us to his climate promises, which is 50% cuts to emissions by 2030. That is when we’ll stop.”“As a young person, I am desperate and I am furious,” Leedy said. “And I think a lot of young people feel that way.”"}, {"title": "Queen Elizabeth II Won’t Attend Climate Conference In Person", "text": "LONDON (AP) — Queen Elizabeth II has canceled her planned appearance at the U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, accepting doctors’ advice to rest just days after spending the night in a hospital for tests.The 95-year-old monarch announced Tuesday that she has “regretfully” decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the reception on Nov. 1 — a move that will dash the hopes of Britain’s Conservative government, which is anxious to show the importance of the session to the fate of the planet.The climate conference runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 and her attendance was meant to kick it off in style and splendor.“Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message,” Buckingham Palace said.The news came after the sovereign held virtual audiences Tuesday at Windsor Castle — the first since revelations that her doctors ordered her to rest last week.The sovereign greeted the ambassadors from South Korea and Switzerland during her first technology-aided appearance since she was driven to London’s King Edward VII’s Hospital on Oct. 20 for “preliminary investigations.” She returned to her Windsor Castle home at lunchtime the next day and has been taking on light duties since.The queen underwent the medical tests after she canceled a scheduled trip to mark 100 years since the creation of Northern Ireland, and the palace said she had “reluctantly” accepted advice to rest for a few days. The matter was not related to COVID-19.Her doctors ordered rest last week after the monarch who likes to be seen by the people carried out a hectic series of events. She held audiences with diplomats, had a reception at Windsor Castle for global business leaders and attended the horse races at Ascot.Her hospital visit last week came amid general disquiet about Elizabeth’s health. Days earlier, she was seen using a walking stick at a Westminster Abbey service marking the centenary of the Royal British Legion, an armed forces charity. Although she had used a cane in 2003, it was after she underwent knee surgery.The queen’s husband, Prince Philip, died in April 2021 at 99.

Here's What You Should Know.", "text": "The artificial Christmas tree industry is facing challenges this holiday season due to ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain.Like many decorations and gifts, artificial trees are often imported from China, so port congestion and shipping delays are affecting timing and availability this year. As a result, experts are recommending that Americans order their fake trees as early as possible to ensure delivery in time for holiday festivities.But what about real Christmas trees? Murmurs of shortages tend to crop up year after year, but is that the case in 2021? And how do the effects of climate change and the current supply chain issues affect our ability to get one of those green centerpieces into our homes?Below, industry experts share their insights about the 2021 Christmas tree season.Lately it seems like every year there are headlines or news clips about tree lots selling out ― sparking fears of natural tree shortages around the holiday season. But there might be some misconceptions at play.“We’ve never run out of Christmas trees in the U.S.,” said Tim O’Connor, executive director of the National Christmas Tree Association. “The supply of trees has become tighter though. Previously growers had planted too many trees, and there weren’t enough buyers to purchase them all, so it was a difficult time in the industry ― everyone was selling their trees at a loss.”Today, holiday shoppers aren’t seeing the surpluses of the 1990s and 2000s, as many farmers scaled back their operations and started planting fewer trees amid the Great Recession. O’Connor explained that it takes seven to 10 years on average to grow a tree, so we’ve been feeling the effects in recent holiday seasons.With less excess product, certain tree lots might sell out more quickly, but consumers should still be able to find trees at other locations.“When we hear about Christmas tree shortages, it’s less about not having enough trees, but more that your tree may not be from the place you want it to be and the type you want it to be,” said James Farmer, an associate professor at Indiana University’s O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.“For example, Fraser firs are a popular variety but not native to most places, so they’re challenging to grow and have to be shipped across the U.S. from places where the climate is right,” he added.Both Farmer and O’Connor noted that demand for real trees went up in 2020 when people were pent up at home during the pandemic holiday season and looking to foster a little Christmas cheer.“Here in Indiana, most of the trees at Christmas tree farms sold out in like two weekends,” Farmer recalled, adding that U-cut options were especially popular. “People were looking for these experiences, being outdoors on a big farm, and it’s socially distanced. We interviewed 25 farmers and all but two had sold out.”On the wholesale side, demand has also gone up, but supply is similarly limited.“A lot of buyers of wholesale trees want more than in the past, but they’re having trouble finding them,” O’Connor said. “The growers that grow trees have already sold them or are committed to customers with a history, so that’s part of what fuels the shortage stories lately. In past years, you’d get to mid- to late December, and most people who wanted a tree already had one. But tree lots would still have a couple hundred trees available. Last year that number was greatly reduced, and almost every tree available was sold.”While the decrease in overall planting is the simplest explanation for lower supply in the Christmas tree industry, the other big factor that tends to arise in these conversations is climate change. Environmental factors like droughts and rising temperatures can decrease the amount of viable trees on a farm.“Here in the Midwest in Indiana about nine years ago, we had a severe drought, and a lot of trees died, so many U-cut tree farms have missing stock from that time period,” Farmer explained. “This summer, there was all the news about Christmas tree farms in the Pacific Northwest. They’re having some of the hottest temperatures and driest months on record. And the younger the trees are, the more vulnerable they are because they don’t have an established root system.”O’Connor confirmed that NCTA members who grow Christmas trees reported high temperatures this year, but he emphasized that the situation affected growers in the region differently. As a result, it’s hard to generalize about the impact on the industry as a whole.“In agriculture, microclimates really matter,” he said. “There are some growers whose microclimate conditions caused that heat to settle in a valley and they did suffer some extensive damage to their trees ― typically not dead but some are damaged to the point that they can’t be sold this year. But just over the hill another grower didn’t have nearly as much bad impact.”It takes time for Christmas tree farms to pivot since it takes nearly a decade on average for the trees to grow, and certain varieties will only thrive under particular conditions available in specific locations. But farmers are learning to adapt to challenges presented by climate change.“The seedlings many of our growers planted this spring had a high loss rate, but they’re shifting to fall plantings as a new practice,” O’Connor explained. “What they’re learning is trees that are fall-planted usually get cooler, wetter temperatures and have a better start on growing than the ones planted in the spring ― which was typical ― so it’s a change in cultural norms. They’re also experimenting with other tree varieties that can handle these changing conditions better.”While the current supply chain disruptions involve congested ports and overseas shipping delays, there are also issues with worker shortages and delivery lags within the U.S.Thus far, O’Connor says he hasn’t seen any major impact on the real Christmas tree industry, which relies on a system of trucks to deliver the firs, spruces and other offerings to lots and customers across the country.“Certainly it’s possible that on an individual basis, somebody’s Christmas trees may have some difficulty with trucking,” he said. “But in general I haven’t heard from our members that their trucking situation is any different at this point. This is part of their business built in years ago. They have long-standing relationships with the trucks that they use. So if it’s going to be impacted, it’s going to be a bit of a surprise.”Beyond the deliveries to lots, Christmas tree shopping typically involves in-person transactions, as people often drive to local farms make a selection. If you want your top choice of tree variety and retailer, O’Connor recommends going early in the buying window.“The season typically starts the day after Thanksgiving, so that Friday is opening day for most farms and lots,” he explained. “Last year, some opened a week before because customers were contacting them about coming early to get a tree. Still, that weekend after Thanksgiving is a good time to buy a tree. That’s about the maximum amount of time you’re able to keep a tree in good shape before Christmas.”"}, {"title": "Audubon Naturalist Society Dumping Name Of Bird-Loving Slaveholder", "text": "The Audubon Naturalist Society is jettisoning its name because of the “pain” caused by the 19th century ornithologist — and slaveholder — John James Audubon, it announced last week.“The deliberate and thoughtful decision to change our name is part of our ongoing commitment to creating a larger and more diverse community of people who treasure the natural world and work to preserve it. It has become clear that this will never be fully possible with our current name,” said a statement from the organization.“We will change our name to one that better reflects the growing, rich diversity of the region that we serve and sends a clear message now and in the future: Nature needs all of us.”The Audubon Naturalist Society advocates for wildlife, especially birds, and maintains sanctuaries in Maryland, Virginia and the Washington, D.C., area.John James Audubon was predominantly known for his studies and illustrations of American birds.But he also enslaved people — and sold them when he was short on cash — in the 1820s. In addition, his legacy has been stained over his objections to the abolitionist movement and for writings characterizing Black and Indigenous people as inferior to white people.“We can and must do better to address equity and racial justice in everything we do,” said Diane Wood, incoming ANS board president. “We are deeply invested in breaking down barriers and acknowledging our part in an exclusionary past.”A new name has not yet been chosen for the organization. One will be picked “after a deliberate and thoughtful process of listening and learning from the current ANS community as well as the nature lovers we aspire to partner with in the future,” said the ANS statement.There’s no word yet on whether the National Audubon Society — the largest organization to still carry Audubon’s name — will make a change."}, {"title": "Drought-Stricken California Doused By Powerful Storm", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A powerful storm barreled toward Southern California after flooding highways, toppling trees and causing mud flows in areas burned bare by recent fires across the northern part of the state.Drenching showers and strong winds accompanied the weekend’s arrival of an atmospheric river — a long and wide plume of moisture pulled in from the Pacific Ocean. The National Weather Service’s Sacramento office warned of “potentially historic rain.”Flooding was reported across the San Francisco Bay Area, closing streets in Berkeley, inundating Oakland’s Bay Bridge toll plaza and overflowing rivers in Napa and Sonoma counties. Power poles were downed and tens of thousands of people in the North Bay were without electricity.By Sunday morning, Mount Tamalpais just north of San Francisco had recorded a half foot (15 centimeters) of rainfall during the previous 12 hours, the weather service said.“Some of our higher elevation locations could see 6, 7, 8 inches of rain before we’re all said and done,” weather service meteorologist Sean Miller said.About 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north, the California Highway Patrol closed a stretch of State Route 70 in Butte and Plumas counties because of multiple landslides within the massive Dixie Fire burn scar.“We have already had several collisions this morning for vehicles hydroplaning, numerous trees falling, and several roadways that are experiencing flooding,” the highway patrol’s office in Oroville tweeted on Sunday. “If you can stay home and off the roads today, please do. If you are out on the roads, please use extreme caution.”In nearby Colusa and Yolo counties, state highways 16 and 20 were shut for several miles due to mudslides, the state Department of Transportation said.Burn areas remain a concern, as land devoid of vegetation can’t soak up heavy rainfall as quickly, increasing the likelihood of flash flooding.“If you are in the vicinity of a recent burn scar and haven’t already, prepare now for likely debris flows,” the Sacramento weather service tweeted. “If you are told to evacuate by local officials, or you feel threatened, do not hesitate to do so. If it is too late to evacuate, get to higher ground.”South of San Francisco, evacuation orders were in effect in the Santa Cruz Mountains over concerns that several inches of rain could trigger debris flows in the CZU Lightning Complex Fire burn scar when the storm moves through early Monday. Further south, parts of western Santa Barbara County saw evacuation warnings upgraded to orders in the area burned by this month’s Alisal Fire.Strong winds were also expected, with gusts of up to 60 mph (97 kph) at the windiest spots in Northern California. Elevations above 9,000 feet (2,745 meters) in the Sierra Nevada could get 18 inches of snow or more from Sunday until Monday morning.Recent storms have helped contain some of the nation’s largest wildfires this year. But it remains to be seen if the wet weather will make a dent in the drought that’s plaguing California and the western United States. California’s climate is hotter and drier now and that means the rain and snow that does fall is likely to evaporate or absorb into the soil.California’s 2021 water year, which ended Sept. 30, was the second driest on record and last year’s was the fifth driest on record. Some of the state’s most important reservoirs are at record low levels."}, {"title": "Elusive Owl Caught On Camera After Flying Under Radar For 150 Years", "text": "WHOOOOOO is that beautiful bird?An elusive owl has been definitively photographed in the wild for the first time in a rainforest of Ghana.British ecologist Dr. Robert Williams snapped the monumental photo of Shelley’s eagle owl while in Ghana’s Atewa Range Forest Reserve with Dr. Joseph Tobias, a biologist with Imperial College London, according to a release from the university published Thursday.Not a lot is known about Shelley’s eagle owls, which at around 2 feet in length, are the largest owls in the rainforests of the African continent. They’ve been seen in forests in Central and Western Africa, and, prior to this sighting in the hilly Atewa forest, have been known to inhabit lowland areas.“This is a sensational discovery,” Dr. Nathaniel Annorbah of Ghana’s University of Environment and Sustainable Development said in the statement. “This is a sensational discovery. We’ve been searching for this mysterious bird for years in the western lowlands, so to find it here in ridgetop forests of Eastern Region is a huge surprise.”Western scientists first learned about the bird in 1872. Since then, there have been scattered sightings of the bird, but no photographs besides one of a captive owl at a Belgian zoo in 1975, and one image ― described by Thursday’s release as a “pixelated blob” ― from 2005 that was too blurry for anyone to confirm it’s the right species.The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the birds as “vulnerable,” with threats including logging, habitat destruction, and hunting that reduces available prey for the owls.The Atewa Range Forest Reserve, where the owl was just photographed, faces multiple threats, including commercial mining for bauxite (a substance is used to produce aluminum) and illegal logging, according to conservation organization A Rocha Ghana.The group, which wants to make the Atewa forest a national park, cited the owl on Twitter as yet “another reason” to protect the forest."}, {"title": "Wisconsin Wolf Hunt Temporarily Blocked By Court", "text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A judge on Friday halted Wisconsin’s fall wolf season two weeks before hunters were set to take to the woods, siding with wildlife advocacy groups who argued that holding the hunt would be unconstitutional.Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost issued a temporary injunction halting the season, which was set to begin Nov. 6. The order comes as part of a lawsuit that a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups filed in August seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate a state law authorizing annual seasons.Among other things, the coalition argued that the season is illegal because the Department of Natural Resources hasn’t updated its regulations setting up season parameters and has been relying on an emergency rule put in place shortly after then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a law in 2012 authorizing annual seasons and a wolf management plan that hasn’t been updated since 2007.Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional on its face, but that the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it. The law gives the DNR great leeway in setting kill limits, hunting zone hours and the number of licenses making it all the more important that the department following the regulatory process to ensure it doesn’t violate the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, Frost said.“I’m not overruling the wolf hunt law. In fact, I’m saying it has to be enforced as it was written and intended,” Frost said. “The DNR is currently not following the law or following the constitution. Its decisions are built on a faulty basis, meaning they can’t stand, either.”The judge said the injunction will remain in place until the DNR implements updated regulations on determining quotas and the number of licenses it issues and updates its wolf management plan with new wolf population goals for the state.Hannah Jurss, an assistant attorney general representing the DNR in the case, asked Frost to stay his ruling pending appeal, calling his ruling “unquestionably a dramatic decision.” Frost refused, saying the DNR could still hold a season this year if it can move quickly on new regulations.DNR spokeswoman Sarah Hoye said the agency would review the injunction and had no further comment.Hunters, farmers and conservationists have been sparring for years over how to handle wolves in Wisconsin. Farmers insist that the animals are destroying their crops and that killing them is the only way to control them. Conservationists and wildlife advocates insist the wolf population is too fragile to support hunting and that the animals are too beautiful to destroy.The state held fall wolf seasons in 2012, 2013 and 2014 before a federal judge placed the animal back on the endangered species list.The Trump administration removed them from the list last year and the decision became final in January, triggering a hunting season in Wisconsin..The DNR was preparing to launch a November season, but Kansas-based hunting group Hunter Nation won a court-order forcing the agency to hold a season in February. The group argued that the Biden administration could restore federal protections for wolves at any moment, robbing hunters of the chance to kill the animals.The DNR scrambled to put together a season, setting the kill limit at 119 wolves. Hunters quickly blew past the limit, killing 218 wolves in just four days. The latest DNR estimates put the wolf population in Wisconsin at about 1,000.Conservationists decried the season as a massacre. They urged the DNR policy board to cancel the fall season to protect what’s left of the population. Conservatives on the board brushed those concerns aside, though. During a meeting in August, they authorized the fall hunting season and set the kill limit at 300 wolves, prompting the lawsuit from the wildlife advocacy groups  as well as a federal lawsuit from a half-dozen Chippewa tribes.  The Chippewa consider the wolf sacred. That lawsuit is still pending.Earlier this month, the DNR, which is controlled by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, took the unprecedented step of unilaterally reducing the kill limit to 130 wolves, openly defying the board.The Chippewa have claimed 56 of those animals per treaty rights that allow them to claim 50% of quotas in northern Wisconsin’s ceded territory — land the tribes gave the government in the 1800s. The Chippewa consider the wolf sacred and refuse to hunt it, which means that if the season happens the working quota for state-licensed hunters will be 74 wolves."}, {"title": "Tiger Rescued From Freezing Backyard Cage Celebrates 1st Birthday At Sanctuary", "text": "A tiger rescued as a cub from a Texas backyard during the state’s historic cold spell in February celebrated her first birthday last week at the sanctuary where she now lives.Elsa, named after the “Frozen” character, enjoyed some special birthday treats and got to tear into a piñata filled with different foods and scents at Black Beauty Ranch in Murchison, Texas.Now that she’s older and bigger ― 185 pounds and growing ― she was also able to move to a new area of the sanctuary that includes an in-ground pool, a waterfall, multi-level platforms for climbing, and a big cat hammock, according to a release from the Humane Society of the United States, which runs the sanctuary.Law enforcement removed Elsa from a home in San Antonio in February after a neighbor called to report what sounded like a crying tiger, according to My San Antonio. Sheriff Javier Salazar of the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office said deputies found the young tiger in “not suitable” living conditions: a cage outside, as record low temperatures hit the state.While Texas does not have a law prohibiting keeping tigers as pets, San Antonio city code prohibits “exotic cats.”When found, Elsa had a missing patch of fur that appeared to be from rubbing against her cage. Some of her fur was also “worn down” from a harness she was wearing in the cage, according to the Humane Society.Things are looking much brighter these days for the spunky feline.“She loves rolling around in the grass, swimming and playing with her favorite enrichment ball in the pool,” Black Beauty senior director Noelle Almrud said in the statement. “She has become more confident, and her sassy, observant and intelligent personality is shining through.”"}, {"title": "Right-Wingers Want You To Believe Environmentalists Did Another Jan. 6", "text": "Republicans and right-wing media outlets are comparing — even equating — last week’s largely peaceful climate protests in Washington, D.C. to the violent Jan. 6 riot in the U.S. Capitol, further advancing duel attempts to both soft-pedal the insurrection while painting environmental activists as extremists.For five straight days last week, Native American and environmental justice advocates took to the streets of Washington to demand that the Biden administration act swiftly to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and block new fossil fuel projects, including the controversial Line 3 oil pipeline in Minnesota. The Indigenous-led protests were organized by a coalition of groups called Build Back Fossil Free, a nod to President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Plan.The five-day protest did include clashes. More than 600 people were arrested, according to organizers, mostly on obstruction and crowding charges. At least three demonstrators were charged with assault against a police officer, The Washington Post reported, although details of those alleged assaults have not been released. And “multiple injuries were sustained by security personnel” when protesters staged a sit-in at the Interior Department’s headquarters on Oct. 14, agency spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said in a statement. One officer reportedly was transported to the hospital.But to equate last week’s desperate calls for federal action to stave off potentially catastrophic planetary warming to the pro-Trump mob that descended on U.S. Capitol in an effort to thwart the 2020 presidential election and undermine American democracy is “a ridiculous and false comparison,” said Jean Su, energy justice director for environmental group Center for Biological Diversity.“It was incredibly peaceful, per usual of climate protests,” Su said.The Jan. 6 mob seized at least three officers and injured more than 100. Several officers still haven’t returned to work because of the injuries they suffered. Hundreds of former President Donald Trump supporters violently assaulted officers on Jan. 6, including Danny Rodriguez, a Trump fanatic in a MAGA hat who electroshocked Officer Mike Fanone when he was seized by the mob. Jan. 6 rioters tried to gouge out the eyes of police officers guarding the Capitol, and attacked them with every weapon at their disposal: fire extinguishers, mace, wasp spray, flag poles, fences, hockey sticks, metal poles, batons and an enormous “TRUMP” sign that the mob pushed into a police line.The FBI has made around 650 arrests in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, but that’s just a fraction of the total criminal activity that day. The number of potential future defendants who committed conduct that prosecutors will charge if they’re identified is about 2,500. As of today, more than 250 people who assaulted police officers on Jan. 6 haven’t been arrested yet, and their photos are featured on the FBI website, along with roughly 100 others wanted for other serious crimes including assaulting media.Su was present at last week’s climate demonstrations outside the White House, but was not at the Interior building. Organizers have challenged officials’ accounts of what occurred, alleging that “police acted aggressively with the water protectors and indigenous leaders, tasing at least two people and hitting others with batons.”Ryan Zinke, the former Interior secretary under Trump, was among the first to condemn last week’s protest at Interior’s headquarters. In a statement posted to Twitter, he called the incident “shocking” and “frankly sickening,” and asserted that such “blatant lawlessness” would never have occurred on his watch.“Where is the liberal outrage now against lawlessness and destruction of government property?” he asked. “Deafeningly silent of course.”It was Zinke who remained silent about the Jan. 6 riot. The former Trump official and current candidate for Montana’s newly designated congressional district put out no public statements in the wake of the Capitol attack, according to HuffPost’s review of news articles and social media. And when NBC Montana asked him in April how he felt watching the attack, Zinke said that was an issue for a later date.In July, the former Navy SEAL took to Twitter to tout his endorsement from Trump, the man most responsible for inciting the violent mob a few months earlier.Other Republicans and right-wing media outlets have piled on. In comments to E&E News, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) denounced what he called a “mob of extremists” and claimed that “just a few hours after the violence and the break-in occurred, instead of condemning the radicals, the Biden administration praised them — praised them.”As E&E reported, that isn’t what happened. McConnell misrepresented comments that White House press secretary Jen Psaki made during an exchange at an Oct. 14 press briefing. A reporter asked Psaki not about the protesters’ actions at Interior, but rather their demands throughout the week for more aggressive climate action.“Of course we’re listening to advocates and people who have been elevating the issue of climate for decades,” Psaki said. “They have important voices, and they put climate on the front of the agenda when it wasn’t 10 years and 20 years ago.”This narrative about some sort of “insurrection” taking place has only continued to grow.“There Was An Insurrection Last Week And No One Noticed,” read a Tuesday headline on right-wing website PJ Media. (An editor’s note at the bottom of that article asks readers for help to “fight back against the lying liberal media who will do anything to preserve their leftist narrative.”)In their own extensive coverage of the event, Fox News reporters and TV hosts labeled the protesters “zealots,” “insurrectionists,” a “climate militia” and “villain of the day,” according to clips compiled by media watchdog group Media Matters. One Fox News headline declared the scene outside the Interior Department as “reminiscent of Jan. 6,” using a partial quote from far-right media activist and troll Andy Ngo.Rep. Gregory Steube (R-Fla.) spent his allotted time during a Thursday congressional hearing interrogating Attorney General Merrick Garland about the demonstration.“Just last week, on Oct. 14, a group of extremist, environmental and ‘Indigenous’ protestors forced their way into the Department of Interior,” Steube said, using air quotes when he said the word Indigenous. “They fought with and injured security and police officers, sending some of those officers to the hospital. The extremists violently pushed their way into a restricted government building in an attempt to thwart the work of the Department of the Interior.”Steube later held up two photographs — one from Jan. 6 and the other from the Oct. 14 protest at Interior — and asked Garland if he’d call both incidents domestic terrorism. Garland said it was the first he’d heard about the incident, but that the Justice Department “doesn’t care whether the violence comes from the left or from the right.”“I’m not going to be able to resolve a legal determination based on one picture,” Garland added. “In the Jan. 6 case, we have terabytes of video which disclose exactly what happened.”The Federal Protective Service, a division of the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, did not provide HuffPost with updated information about injuries to officers or the assault charges on Friday.Steube later declared on Twitter that Garland’s response “demonstrates their clear politicization of the DOJ.”The Florida congressman did condemn the Jan. 6 attack. But he was also among dozens of Republicans who promoted Trump’s “big lie” of a rigged presidential election that ultimately fueled the Capitol insurrection. And days after the riot, he joined 146 other Republicans in voting to overturn the 2020 election results.Later, in June, he voted against honoring Capitol police who responded to the Capitol on Jan. 6.Ryan Reilly contributed reporting."}, {"title": "Fox News' Dana Perino Makes 'Nonsensical' Comment About Wind Power", "text": "Fox News’ Dana Perino caught some blowback Thursday for suggesting that wind power isn’t green because the turbines are not recyclable.

So, I think that there’s just a misunderstanding of just how really green these are.”Carlson, who was on the show promoting his “Tucker Carlson Originals” episode decrying the wind power industry, replied, “Well, that’s right. There’s no painless way to get energy. Every energy has a downside.”While the two appeared unclear about the concept of renewable energy in the clip, Perino also seemed to mislead about the actual renewability of the materials in wind turbines. She noted a landfill in Wyoming, where retired turbine blades, usually made of carbon fiber, are buried.But she failed to mention that “about 85% of turbine components, including steel, copper wire, electronics and gearing, can be recycled or reused,” Bloomberg wrote in a 2020 article about turbines in landfills.Th American Wind Energy Association in Washington says the blades are “landfill-safe, unlike the waste from other energy sources, and represent a small fraction of overall U.S. municipal solid waste.”Mocking Perino’s comment was a breeze for many on Twitter:H/T Media Matters"}, {"title": "Why No Tusks? Poaching Tips Scales Of Elephant Evolution", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A hefty set of tusks is usually an advantage for elephants, allowing them to dig for water, strip bark for food and joust with other elephants. But during episodes of intense ivory poaching, those big incisors become a liability.Now researchers have pinpointed how years of civil war and poaching in Mozambique have led to a greater proportion of elephants that will never develop tusks.During the conflict from 1977 to 1992, fighters on both sides slaughtered elephants for ivory to finance war efforts. In the region that’s now Gorongosa National Park, around 90% of the elephants were killed.The survivors were likely to share a key characteristic: half the females were naturally tuskless — they simply never developed tusks — while before the war, less than a fifth lacked tusks.Like eye color in humans, genes are responsible for whether elephants inherit tusks from their parents. Although tusklessness was once rare in African savannah elephants, it’s become more common — like a rare eye color becoming widespread.After the war, those tuskless surviving females passed on their genes with expected, as well as surprising, results. About half their daughters were tuskless. More perplexing, two-thirds of their offspring were female.The years of unrest “changed the trajectory of evolution in that population,” said evolutionary biologist Shane Campbell-Staton, based at Princeton University.With colleagues, he set out to understand how the pressure of the ivory trade had tipped the scale of natural selection. Their findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.Researchers in Mozambique, including biologists Dominique Goncalves and Joyce Poole, observed the national park ’s roughly 800 elephants over several years to create a catalogue of mothers and offspring.“Female calves stay by their mothers, and so do males up to a certain age,” said Poole, who is scientific director and co-founder of the nonprofit ElephantVoices.Poole had previously seen other cases of elephant populations with a disproportionately large number of tuskless females after intense poaching, including in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. “I’ve been puzzling over why it’s the females who are tuskless for a very long time,” said Poole, who is a co-author of the study.In Gorongosa, the team collected blood samples from seven tusked and 11 tuskless female elephants, then analyzed their DNA for differences.The elephant survey data gave them an idea where to look: Because the tuskless elephants were female, they focused on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes; males have one X and one Y chromosome.)They also suspected that the relevant gene was dominant – meaning that a female needs only one altered gene to become tuskless — and that when passed to male embryos, it may short-circuit their development.“When mothers pass it on, we think the sons likely die early in development, a miscarriage,” said Brian Arnold, a co-author and evolutionary biologist at Princeton.Their genetic analysis revealed two key parts of the elephants’ DNA that they think play a role in passing on the trait of tusklessness. The same genes are associated with the development of teeth in other mammals.“They’ve produced the smoking-gun evidence for genetic changes,” said Chris Darimont, a conservation scientist at the University of Victoria in Canada, who was not involved in the research. The work “helps scientists and the public understand how our society can have a major influence on the evolution of other life forms.”Most people think of evolution as something that proceeds slowly, but humans can hit the accelerator.“When we think about natural selection, we think about it happening over hundreds, or thousands, of years,” said Samuel Wasser, a conservation biologist at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the research. “The fact that this dramatic selection for tusklessness happened over 15 years is one of the most astonishing findings.”Now the scientists are studying what more tuskless elephants means for the species and its savannah environment. Their preliminary analysis of fecal samples suggests the Gorongosa elephants are shifting their diet, without long incisors to peel bark from trees.“The tuskless females ate mostly grass, whereas the tusked animals ate more legumes and tough woody plants,” said Robert Pringle, a co-author and biologist at Princeton University. “These changes will last for at least multiple elephant generations.”___Follow Christina Larson on Twitter: @larsonchristina___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

It marks the first time the council has deemed climate change an “emerging threat” to the U.S. economy since the council was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010.“Are we behind? Of course we are,” a senior administration official on the council, who declined to be named on the record, said on a press call. “This is the starting gun going off for the U.S. financial regulatory system.”The assessment came just days after British regulators called on companies to disclose strategies to swiftly zero out planet-heating pollution and their European Union counterparts outlined plans to test banks’ ability to withstand climate-related shocks. Emphasizing the political challenges the U.S. faces in confronting the crisis, the Biden administration’s plan to cut roughly one-third of the nation’s emissions appeared to die in Congress, setting policymakers scrambling for alternatives.“This is the step we’re taking to catch up and put ourselves in a leadership role internationally, which is where we want to be,” said the staffer, who has worked at FSOC for 10 years. “And this is the way to do it.”The myriad ways warming-fueled disasters, or hapless attempts to avert them, could upend the U.S. economy unfold in dry, sober language across the report’s 133 pages.Financial contagion could spread from the physical wounds of climate change. Extreme weather and flooding may render regions of the country too costly to insure, condemning entire communities ― households, businesses and governments alike ― to economic and financial precarity with unclear options. The mounting toll of physical damages could wipe out the income properties generate or destroy the value of assets used as collateral, “posing credit and market risks to banks, insurers, pension plans, and others,” the report states.Another threat could come from the solution to climate change itself. With each passing month that pollution from burning fossil fuels and felling forests for cattle ranches increases, the speed of change that’s required to avert cataclysmic temperature rise climbs. If countries take divergent paths and fail to coordinate, it could “sow confusion or create large inefficiencies, thereby possibly straining the financial system.”The rapid shifts could also quickly make previously valuable investments virtually worthless. “Delays and years of complacency eventually require larger, more disruptive policy adjustments ... which would likely have more dramatic effects on economic activity and asset values.”Coal, the report notes, is already widely viewed to be in irreversible decline, with 65% of U.S. plants shutting down over the past decade. But in 2019, the U.S. had nearly 200 gas-fired plants under construction. While natural gas produces less carbon than coal, it still spews tons of climate-changing pollution, including methane, which is an 86-times more potent heat trapper over a two-decade period than CO2.Reaching the U.S. goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 “would require sizable reductions in the use of natural gas,” the report warns, suggesting the value of gas assets could plummet even more chaotically than coal.“A thorough assessment of the potential for stranded assets in these sectors should be a priority for financial institutions in their risk management processes and a component of a regulatory scenario analysis,” the report states. The senior official declined to comment further.The report, which President Joe Biden called for in an executive order this spring, is “unprecedented” and “sends a strong signal to industry, to Wall Street, that regulators are waking up to this issue and taking it seriously,” said David Arkush, the managing director of the climate program at the consumer watchdog Public Citizen.Still, he said, “It is extremely far short of what is needed. It almost reads to me like the memo that should have started this process in May when the president issued the executive order.”The document could have offered more prescriptive solutions, including calling on the Federal Reserve to cap how much of an investor’s portfolio can include unmitigated fossil fuels or proposing banks that own risky oil and gas assets keep a certain amount of cash on hand, said Ben Cushing, the campaign manager of the Sierra Club’s fossil-free finance program.“This report makes it clear that financial regulators understand the need for action to ensure that the climate crisis doesn’t cause the next financial crisis,” he said in an emailed statement. “However, by leaving out key risk-reduction tools, it is not treating the problem with the urgency it deserves.Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he was “optimistic that the needle is beginning to move.”Asked whether the fact that U.S. financial regulators are only beginning this process now, when the number of billion-dollar weather disasters increases each year and United Nations scientists say the emissions crisis has reached a “code red” level, the senior administration official said: “I reject that conclusion.”“The whole purpose of this is to communicate the opposite,” the official said. “We are ready. Ready means we’re engaging in a significant way.”"}, {"title": "How Worsening Heat, Fires And Droughts Are Killing Us: Report", "text": "Climate change is “first and foremost a health crisis,” and the negative effects of extreme heat, wildfires and droughts on people are “varied and widespread,” according to a new report.In a climate report released this week, researchers with the medical journal The Lancet warned that the warming climate “will affect every U.S. region” and there is “no safe global temperature rise from a health perspective.”The annual report looked at three interrelated hazards that are amplified by climate change — heat, droughts and wildfires — and the threats they pose to humans, from worsening mental health to increased risk of heart and lung issues.“While everyone’s health is already at risk, some populations bear a greater burden,” the report said, noting that “decades of racially biased policies” place Black, Latinx, Asian and Native people, as well as low-income communities, at disproportionately high risk amid the climate crisis.2020 saw the second highest amount of heat wave exposure in the United States since 1986, the report says. As climate change has increased the frequency, duration and intensity of heat waves, research shows that being exposed to extreme heat can lead to low-quality sleep, worse mental health and heat-related illness or exacerbated chronic illness, such as cardiovascular or pulmonary issues.Communities of color, poor communities, outdoor workers and incarcerated people are disproportionately exposed to extreme heat due to “policy failures,” the report said.Last year was tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record, according to an analysis from NASA. The past seven years have been the hottest ever recorded on the planet.This summer, a record-breaking heat wave in the Pacific Northwest killed hundreds of people and left agriculture workers — many of them undocumented — suffering through 100-plus degree days to get food on people’s tables.Black and Latinx workers experience about 35 to 45 days with temperatures above 90, while white workers experience about 25 to 30 such days, according to a September report from the Adrienne-Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center.A drought is broadly defined as a water shortage that can’t meet demand. It can harm people by decreasing crop yields and worsening food insecurity; exacerbating mental health issues; and reducing water quality and access, particularly for Indigenous communities that depend on water systems in rural areas or may be more vulnerable to urban shut-offs.California is under a drought emergency after the state — which had already been plagued by some of its worst droughts and wildfires in recent years — just recorded its driest year in nearly a century. The 2021 water year, which ran from Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021, saw the least amount of rainfall since 1924.Record-breaking wildfires tore through Northern California in August, including the Dixie fire, the largest single fire in state history. Smoke from the massive fire reached all the way to the East Coast, affecting air quality in states throughout the country.Wildfire smoke contains numerous harmful air pollutants, according to the Lancet report, and increased exposure can lead to a higher risk of heart and lung disease, poor mental health and a greater risk of preterm birth.Eight of the 10 largest fires in California history took place in just the last five years. This year so far, 2.5 million acres have burned across the state, nearly twice as much as the five-year average.“The long-predicted consequences of climate change are unfolding,” the report said, urging governments and corporations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help save lives."}, {"title": "Fish Found With Parasite That Eats Its Tongue And Then Becomes Its Tongue", "text": "You’ve heard about a cat getting your tongue, but how about a tongue-eating louse?Earlier this week, officials with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department took a photo of a strange parasite resembling a pill bug that is also known as the snapper-choking isopod, according to San Antonio ABC affiliate KSAT.The fish containing the parasite was found at Galveston Island State Park. Officials jokingly suggested on Facebook that the creature was a Martian before offering the true science surrounding the crustacean.The tongue-eating louse attaches itself to the fish’s mouth and then replaces the tongue, according to the Houston Chronicle.The parasite then survives in the fish’s mouth by feeding on the host animal’s mucus ― the only known example of a parasite replacing an organ of its host.Although the animal’s modus operandi could be the stuff of nightmares, officials said in the Facebook post below that the tongue-eating louse “does not kill the fish or affect humans.”So far, the reaction to the creepy creature can be summed by the person who remarked, “Thanks for the new nightmare material.

Gavin Newsom (D) said Thursday morning his administration has drafted a rule proposing a mandatory 3,200-foot barrier between new oil and gas wells and homes, schools and hospitals, a substantial shift as the state previously had no limit in many areas and effectively allowed drilling in many Californians’ backyards. Following a public comment period and economic analysis, the regulation could go into effect in 2023.The draft rule from the California Geologic Energy Management Division will go beyond the 2,500-foot buffer proposed by environmental groups.“Our reliance on fossil fuels has resulted in more kids getting asthma, more children born with birth defects, and more communities exposed to toxic, dangerous chemicals.” Newsom said in a statement Thursday. “We are committed to protecting public health, the economy and our environment as we transition to a greener future that reckons with the realities of the climate crisis we’re all facing.”Newsom made the announcement from Wilmington, California, home to the Wilmington Oil Field. The site is the third-largest oil patch in the contiguous United States with more than 1,550 active wells. But the community in South Los Angeles is also home to about 50,000 people, more than 90% of whom are people of color, Grist notes.Some live less than 200 feet from the Wilmington field and have reported a bevy of health effects linked to the nearby production.“After years of delay, we are encouraged by this announcement from the Newsom administration, which sends a strong signal that oil and gas has no place in neighborhoods,” Neena Mohan, the California Environmental Justice Alliance’s climate justice manager, said in a statement. “We’re ready to carry this rule home and make sure it actually accomplishes what we need it to accomplish: the end of neighborhood oil and gas drilling.”California is unique in its past fondness for neighborhood drilling sites, and until now there were no statewide rules mandating a setback distance for oil and gas sites from communities. Some counties have exclusion zones, known as setbacks, to protect local residents, but Los Angeles County had none despite decades of activism from local community health groups.Grist notes that many oil-producing states like Colorado, Pennsylvania and even Texas already have such regulations. Newsom has faced pressure to do so across California in recent months, with environmental groups noting his office has issued 138 oil permits for operation in state waters since he took office, including five new drilling permits. Onshore, the number issued is more than 9,000 since the start of 2019, according to the group Consumer Watchdog.More than 2 million Californians live within half a mile of an oil well, including many people of color.Newsom’s shift in policy came just a few weeks after a pipeline leaked up to 131,000 gallons of crude oil into the waters of the coast of Huntington Beach in Orange County, causing a mileslong oil slick and renewing concerns about aging fossil fuel infrastructure in the waters off California. The spill, from a line owned by the Texas-based Amplify energy, threatened delicate coastal wetlands and closed some of the nation’s most iconic beaches for days as cleanup crews swept the sand for globs of oil.It was the state’s largest oil spill since 2015, and Newsom foreshadowed that he would take action to transition state support away from fossil fuels.“It’s time once and for all to disabuse ourselves that this has to be part of our future. This is part of our past,” Newsom said earlier this month. “We can moralize and talk about the good old days, but at the end of the day, this isn’t about the stale air of normalcy but the fresh air of progress.”California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta (D), vowed to hold people accountable for the spill, calling the event an “environmental disaster with far-reaching consequences” for wildlife."}, {"title": "Plastics Will Create More Climate Pollution Than Coal In U.S. By 2030, New Study Finds", "text": "Plastics are everywhere. From the stomachs of deep-sea fish to human feces, Arctic snow to gusts of wind in the remote wilderness, the oil and gas byproduct has, barely a century after it was first synthesized in a laboratory, become a ubiquitous feature of virtually every ecosystem on Earth and every aspect of modern life.It’s also playing a key role in permanently changing the climate of the planet it has come to dominate.Plastics already produce 3.8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions throughout their lifecycle, roughly double the planet-heating pollution spewed by airplanes. By the end of this decade, the plastics industry in the United States alone is on pace to eclipse the carbon footprint of the country’s remaining coal-fired power plants, according to a new analysis from Bennington College’s Beyond Plastics think tank.Newly compiled data on the 10 stages of plastic production, usage and disposal show the U.S. plastics industry is releasing at least 232 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, equivalent to 116 average-sized coal-fired power plants.Roughly 65% of the country’s active coal-fired plants retired over the past decade, yet the stupendous growth of the U.S. plastics industry threatens to offset whatever climate progress the world’s largest historical emitter has made at a moment when the nation is struggling to codify its transition from fossil fuels into law.While emissions from power plants, transportation, and industry are expected to take center stage at next month’s United Nations climate summit in Scotland, plastics are virtually absent from the global climate agenda. And despite attention paid to the crisis of plastic trash piling up on buildings and killing aquatic wildlife, the Biden administration’s proposal to decarbonize the U.S. economy similarly overlooks the industry’s carbon footprint.“When most people think of the plastic problem, they think of water pollution and the fact that plastic recycling has been such a failure. They don’t think about climate change,” said Judith Enck, the president of Beyond Plastics who previously spent eight years as a regional administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. “But this is a significant and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions.”Across the country, particularly in states where hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has made the fossil fuel raw materials for plastics production cheap and readily available, the industry and its emissions have grown rapidly. In 2020, plastics emissions increased by 10 million tons compared to the previous year, even as the world’s output of climate-changing gases overall temporarily decreased as the pandemic lockdowns idled cars and factories.Another 12 plastics facilities are currently under construction, with 15 more in the works, likely adding another 40 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution each year by 2025.Heat-trapping carbon is hardly the only pollutant these plants spew. Air pollution near cracker plants ― the type of facility where gas is heated to a high enough temperature to break the fuels into smaller molecules, a main feedstock, or baseline ingredient, for plastics ― contains more than 100 chemicals including cancer-causing benzene, toluene and xylene. Communities in which these facilities are built experience such disproportionate rates of lung cancer, asthma and organ diseases that Louisiana’s infamously dense petrochemical corridor is known internationally as “Cancer Alley.”More than 90% of the carbon emissions the plastics industry reports to the Environmental Protection Agency pollutes just 18 communities, primarily along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas, the report found. Residents there are more likely to be poor and nonwhite. Those living within three miles of these petrochemical clusters earn 28% less than the average U.S. household and are 67% more likely to be people of color, according to the report.To conduct the research, Beyond Plastics enlisted the Maine-based environmental research firm Material Research to collect the public emissions data plastics companies submit to the EPA, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Energy. The industry-reported data showed 114 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2020 alone.But that offered only a narrow view of plastics’ carbon footprint. After collating the regulatory data, researchers then calculated emissions from plastic imports and exports and pipelines carrying the feedstock fuels. By doing so, they identified another 118 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution just last year.In reality, the actual number is likely even higher. That estimate does not include, for example, gases that plastic waste deteriorating in the ocean releases.Sarah-Jeanne Royer, a research scientist at Hawai’i Pacific University’s Center for Marine Debris Research who has studied emissions from plastics, said public understanding of how quickly plastics deteriorate and emit gases has not yet caught up to recent findings.“Whether it’s plastic pollution or plastic that is basically in use, it will be producing different types of greenhouse gases,” said Royer, who was not involved in the report but reviewed its findings for HuffPost. “We very often think about emissions from the production process or maybe from the end-of-life recycling facilities. But we don’t yet have a number for the total amount for when plastic is exposed in the environment.”Adding to that crisis, she said, is the fact that as plastic waste breaks apart in the ocean or in landfills, it expands the exposed surface area and increases emissions from each piece of trash over time.“If anything,” she said of the Beyond Plastics report, “this is an underestimate.”Among the more worrying trends the report documents is the rise of a nascent sector known as chemical recycling. Sometimes called “advanced recycling,” the process involves melting solid plastics down in high-heat furnaces. The resulting liquid feedstocks ― rather than becoming new plastics, as the term “recycling” implies ― are, in many cases, sold as fuel oil.The chemical recycling industry, though still emerging, is littered with failures, including the collapse of projects across three continents, a Reuters investigation published in July found. Of the 35 chemical recycling projects the EPA assessed last December, just six were operating at commercial or demonstration scale, while several ended in lawsuits and settlements for unpaid services and two resulted in the chief executives facing multi-million-dollar fraud judgements.Still, states across the country are enacting legislation to spur the industry on by exempting chemical recycling plants from local environmental regulations. If all the country’s proposed chemical recyclers are built, the plants and the burning of their resulting fuel could emit another 18 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, the Beyond Plastics report found.“I am not surprised by the main conclusions,” said Sangwon Suh, an industrial ecologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, who was not involved in the report but reviewed an advanced copy for HuffPost. “Plastics produce a massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle, while they are barely noticed by the public as their emissions tend to be hidden behind the supply chain.”He cautioned that coal, too, emits more carbon through its life cycle than most figures that cite the pollution it produces when burned reveal. But unlike coal, which scientists say needs to be phased out in the next decade or so to keep global warming from reaching catastrophic levels, “net-zero greenhouse gas emission plastics is possible at a global scale” if producers actually recycle material, use plant matter as a feedstock, and equip facilities with carbon capture technology, Suh said, pointing to a study he co-authored and published in the journal Science this month.The plastics industry’s waste and climate impact are hardly the only social problems that should invite government scrutiny. Plastic prices are soaring, with polypropylene, a main ingredient in most plastics, skyrocketing 135% over the course of 2021, according to a separate report published this week by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The analysis concluded that the industry requires more pricing oversight of the companies that produce most feedstocks, particularly the oil and gas giants that have increasingly relied on their plastics divisions to compensate for declining profits from drilling.“As countries finally begin to eliminate the burning of fossil fuels for power and transportation, the demand for fossil fuels is falling. In desperation, the fossil fuel industry is looking to plastics as a replacement market, as this report details,” Enck wrote in the introduction to the report. “Plastics is the fossil fuel industry’s Plan B. But there is no Plan B for the rest of us.”"}, {"title": "Elephant Makes Rare Fatal Attack To Protect Her Baby", "text": "This mama elephant put her foot down when a predator got too close to her calf at a watering spot in Zambia.In a YouTube clip posted Tuesday, the protective pachyderm stomped a crocodile to death in a rare attack recorded on a cellphone.

But it’s OK if other people do. I don’t really care,” she replied, as seen in a video shared online by The Daily Beast.McCain’s previous disdain for tell-alls was most evident last year, when she accused Mary Trump, the niece of former President Donald Trump, of cashing in with a book about her uncle, titled “Too Much And Never Enough.”“I don’t like family tell-all books, especially when it comes to families with fame and power,” said McCain, the daughter of late Sen.

As part of that process, federal agencies will conduct a two-year study of potential impacts to natural and cultural resources. During that time, no new mining activity is allowed.“A place like the Boundary Waters should be enjoyed by and protected for everyone, not only today but for future generations,” Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement. “Today the Biden Administration is taking an important and sensible step to ensure that we have all the science and the public input necessary to make informed decisions about how mining activities may impact this special place.”Twin Metals Minnesota, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chilean mining giant Antofagasta, has a pair of mineral leases that date back to 1966. The company’s planned mine has long been a political lightning rod, not only in Minnesota but nationally. In the final weeks of President Barack Obama’s administration, federal agencies revoked Twin Metals’ leases, citing concerns that the mine could spoil the wilderness and harm the area’s outdoor recreation industry. The Obama administration ordered a similar review of potential environmental impacts.The Trump administration, however, quickly revived the project, ending the Obama-era study and renewing Twin Metals’ leases in May 2019. The Trump family has ties to Andrónico Luksic, the Chilean billionaire behind the mine.The company said in a statement Wednesday it was “deeply disappointed” by the announcement.“We are working to determine the best path forward to continue advancing our proposed world-class underground copper, nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals mine,” it said.Environmentalists fiercely oppose the project, arguing it could forever pollute the 1.09 million acre Boundary Waters downstream — the most visited wilderness area in the country. The process of extracting sulfide-bearing minerals like copper and nickel can lead to acid mine drainage that can persist indefinitely.Twin Metals maintains its design and the “unique geology” will prevent acid mine drainage from occurring.Democrats and environmental groups applauded Wednesday’s announcement as a win for the Boundary Waters and for science-based decision-making.“You don’t allow America’s most toxic industry next to America’s most popular Wilderness,” Becky Rom, national chair of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters, said in a statement. “The Boundary Waters is a paradise of woods and water. It is an ecological marvel, a world-class outdoor destination, and an economic engine for hundreds of businesses and many thousands of people.

And this May, residents fumed after police drove the former war machine through a predominantly Black neighborhood to serve arrest warrants.The outrage spurred Iowa City council members this summer to demand that the county give the vehicle back to the Pentagon.“It is a vehicle made for wartime circumstances, and in my honest opinion, it doesn’t belong here,” city council member Janice Weiner told HuffPost.The Johnson County Sheriff’s Office isn’t the only law enforcement agency to cite extraordinary weather as the reason it needs hardware from the military. Last year, Congress made a little-noticed tweak to the 1033 Program to give priority access for armored vehicles to police and sheriffs’ departments that claimed to need them for disaster-related emergencies, HuffPost has learned — with few checks on how the vehicles are ultimately used.In recent years, there’s been an explosion in the number of police and sheriffs’ departments citing catastrophic storms, blizzards, and especially floods to justify why they ought to receive an armored vehicle.HuffPost exclusively obtained hundreds of requests for armored vehicles that local agencies wrote to the Defense Department in 2017 and 2018. And in contrast to just a few years earlier, when almost no law enforcement agencies mentioned natural disasters, there were agencies from virtually every state pleading for help with disaster preparedness.There are a few reasons for law enforcement’s shifting rhetoric. Across the country, climate change is fueling more destructive and deadlier catastrophes. The U.S. has not invested in large-scale disaster preparedness, forcing local governments and law enforcement to prepare for disasters ― and pay for it ― largely on their own.But the bigger reason may be that the Defense Department has also started to cue local police and sheriffs to make a big deal out of their role in disaster response. Within the past few years, on the forms that police and sheriffs must submit to justify their requests for armored vehicles, the Pentagon began to list natural disasters as an example justification. (The 1033 Program was created in 1996.)Local agencies eagerly seized on this logic. In the documents HuffPost obtained, a bevy of police and sheriffs’ departments along the Gulf Coast, from Florida to Georgia to Louisiana, mentioned a legendary hurricane season in their states, while New Jersey police departments recalled their total incapacitation after 2012’s Superstorm Sandy.“Our resources were quickly overwhelmed and the inability to respond with adequate high water rescue vehicles severely hampered rescue operations,” the chief of police of Lacey Township, a village in New Jersey’s flood-prone Pine Barrens, wrote in a request for an up-armored Humvee in 2018. (Asked for comment, a deputy for the township said he had no memory of the request.)Then, last year, Congress made the change to the 1033 Program that supercharged the incentives for linking climate disasters to military hardware. In its annual defense spending bill, Congress instructed the Pentagon to give the highest priority to “applications that request vehicles used for disaster-related emergency preparedness, such as high-water rescue vehicles.”Disaster preparedness experts who spoke with HuffPost balked at the idea of flooding the country with even more military vehicles under the auspices of preparing for climate change.Some noted that police are free to use military gear from the Pentagon however they want since no one is charged with making sure law enforcement agencies only use it for disaster response. Others pointed out that police really are responsible for safeguarding the public in the event of a climate catastrophe — and military vehicles don’t do much of anything to help police prepare for that role.“I can guarantee you that none of these police departments putting climate or extreme weather down have emergency management plans to use it [that way],” said Leigh Anderson, a Chicago State University researcher and auditor who oversees police departments in Illinois and Missouri.For years, law enforcement officer training across the country has emphasized offensive tactics, such as practice SWAT raids and active shooter drills. Officers in most jurisdictions are woefully underprepared for rescue operations, Anderson said, with leadership focusing instead on accruing the right equipment.“When it comes to natural disasters, officers are ill-prepared for anything that happens outside the normal police department happenings,” she said.Some of the country’s most critical work is to update infrastructure — to build neighborhoods that don’t flood and roads that don’t buckle in the first place — so that communities can withstand increasing natural disasters, said Rune Storesund, the executive director of the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Catastrophic Risk Management.The country has shunted the role of disaster response onto underprepared police and sheriffs’ departments instead of developing comprehensive response capabilities, a lack of preparedness that will become more deadly as climate change fuels more extreme floods, fires, freezes, heat waves and storms. The federal government could direct routine funding for infrastructure upgrades and oversight, bolstering safety planning instead of simply sending armored trucks.“I’m having a hard time imagining how these military vehicles are directly relatable to climate-related events,” Storesund said.It’s not that military vehicles would be useless during natural catastrophes. Police are responsible for public safety when extreme weather strikes. They are often charged with running evacuations at the onset of a hurricane or a fire, retrieving people left behind, and maintaining order in disaster zones. In such a crisis, the appeal of a truck made to withstand roadside bombs is clear. Many blast-proof vehicles, such as mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, or MRAPs, can drive over fallen trees, withstand high winds, ford several feet of water and keep going at moderate speeds if their tires are punctured.But an obvious consequence of giving police militarized equipment under the auspices of preparing for natural disasters is that police are free to use it for more pernicious purposes.The surplus war gear the Pentagon doles out to local police has fueled a rise in the use of destructive SWAT tactics, like door-busting and using chemical agents, to carry out routine police work like serving warrants and searching for drugs.Military gear has become a fixture at civil demonstrations. In an ugly irony, law enforcement agencies have even used military-style vehicles to brutalize people protesting climate destruction, such as at the 2016 assault in Standing Rock, North Dakota, on Native American pipeline protesters.In the requests HuffPost obtained, many agencies outright acknowledged that they would use military vehicles both for disaster rescues and other, more destructive tasks.Northwoods, Missouri, which requested an armored vehicle in order to police Black Lives Matter protesters in 2017, as HuffPost reported in August, said in its request that it would also use the vehicle to respond to floods, tornadoes and ice storms. If the current policy had been in place at the time, the Pentagon would have fast-tracked a jurisdiction like Northwoods to receive the vehicle.Kit Carson County, a storm-battered stretch of Colorado where the sheriff requested an MRAP to rescue motorists from floods and hail, said it would more often use the vehicle to serve high-risk drug-related search warrants. The police chief of Malden, Missouri, a small force of just 14 officers, noted that the region was one of the hardest-hit by the historic flooding of 2017. He requested an up-armored Humvee to check on residents stranded by future storms — and to carry out drug raids.In an interview with HuffPost, Brad Kunkel, the current sheriff of Johnson County, Iowa, now claims that the county envisioned lots of uses for its MRAP besides just disaster rescues, although he said the department has used it for a flood rescue.Making police primarily responsible for disaster response also means disaster response can be tied to abusive police practices. Most New Jersey towns requesting armored vehicles, including those that emphasized they would be used as disaster-response vehicles, proposed paying for the vehicles’ upkeep with funds from asset forfeiture. Although New Jersey recently curtailed the practice, state law at the time permitted police to fund operations by seizing cash and valuables from people accused but not convicted of crimes.During past disasters, police have injured and killed people they suspected of looting. In the most infamous case, New Orleans police fired AK-47s at citizens fleeing the destruction of Hurricane Katrina, then tried to cover it up. An investigation later blamed the deadly incident on the department’s pervasive culture of corruption.And at a time when a huge share of the public is angered by police impunity, climate disasters offer a friendlier explanation for police militarization.Some law enforcement agencies have used extreme weather as an explanation of last resort when the public clearly opposes police use of former military vehicles. Last fall, police in New London, Connecticut, obtained a mine-resistant Cougar through the 1033 Program for hostage scenarios and active shooter drills. After locals and the city council objected to keeping the vehicle, police framed their a final argument around the need for a rescue vehicle during storms and blizzards.For Weiner, the Iowa City council member, the vehicle in her county offers a dark reminder of her time working at the U.S. embassy in Turkey in the 1990s during the height of the country’s conflict with Kurdish rebels.“I’ve seen plenty of armored vehicles in the streets,” she said. “It’s an atmosphere of intimidation and not an atmosphere I want in my town.”"}, {"title": "California Now Under Statewide Drought Emergency Amid Driest Year Since 1924", "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued a statewide drought emergency on Tuesday and called on residents to further conserve water amid one of the driest years since record keeping began.“As the western U.S. faces a potential third year of drought, it’s critical that Californians across the state redouble our efforts to save water in every way possible,” Newsom said in a statement.Most of the state’s counties had been under a drought emergency since July, but Tuesday’s proclamation added the few regions that were previously spared.Newsom also encouraged Californians to reduce their water use by 15%, a goal first set several months ago, and empowered the state’s Water Resources Control Board to tackle wasteful water practices, like washing sidewalks and driveways or cleaning a car with a running hose.State data shows that many areas have dramatically curbed water use amid the drought. E. Joaquin Esquivel, the chair of the state’s water board, told The Los Angeles Times that recent figures revealed declines in use that were “encouraging and heartening … but we need to continue to ensure we’re conserving.Although storms are predicted for later this month which should bring rain and snow to parts of the state, recent reports show California would need 140% of its average annual precipitation to end the drought.The state recently recorded its driest year in nearly a century. The California Department of Water Resources said this month that the 2021 water year — a period that ran from Oct. 1, 2020 to Sept. 30, 2021 — marked the least rainfall since 1924. Some areas, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, saw less than half of their average annual rainfall during that period.“[E]xtreme conditions that once were rare are occurring with increased frequency,” the agency said. “California’s climate is transitioning to a warmer setting in which historical relationships among temperature, precipitation and runoff are changing.”The ongoing drought will only increase the threat of punishing wildfires. California has been engulfed in massive, record-breaking blazes in recent years due to dry conditions. The Dixie fire, which started in July, is still burning in some areas. It is the largest single wildfire in state history."}, {"title": "Zebra Saga: Maryland Officials Hatch Capture Plan Involving... Even More Zebras", "text": "Two more zebras have been recruited to solve Maryland’s runaway zebra problem.Three zebras stunned locals and viewers of videos online after they escaped from a farm in Upper Marlboro in August and were seen roaming around suburban Maryland.One of the animals was found dead on Sept.16 in an illegal snare trap, according to officials. The remaining two are still on the loose.After multiple failed efforts to capture the escapees, the owner and authorities have devised a plan to bring them in.The idea is to use food and other zebras to attract the zebras at-large into a corral, in order to return them to the herd, according to a Friday press release from the Prince George’s County Department of Environment (DoE).Veterinarians at the Department of Agriculture and DoE Animal Services staff agreed that this would be the best approach with least risk to the escaped animals.“Our priority is to make sure the zebras are captured and returned to the herd,” said DoE Director Andrea L. Crooms. “Once this is accomplished, the County will conduct a further investigation, and any actions including any appropriate charges against the owner will be evaluated.”The owner of the animals, USDA licensed breeder Jerry Holly, has been working with the agencies involved, according to authorities.Holly has managed to keep a low profile, even as the story has made national headlines over the past two months. However, the attention of the killed zebra has brought scrutiny on his business.“The sad fate of this zebra underscores the seriousness of this issue – both from the cruelty of captive exotic animal ownership and operations to the dangerous and barbaric use of traps,” the Humane Society of the United States said in a statement to WDVM.His exotic animal breeding business in Maryland and Florida has owned large cats, primates, giraffes, bears and other animals, DCist reported, citing public records.

What Happens Now?", "text": "With just two weeks until global leaders gather in Scotland for the world’s biggest climate conference, the United States is about to let its leading proposal to cut emissions die in Congress. President Joe Biden had pledged to cut planet-heating pollution in half by 2030, and his allies in Congress proposed a program to pay power companies to replace their coal and gas-fired plants with renewables or retrofit them with carbon capture technology, or else face fines.But after months of negotiations, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose home state and personal fortune depend on the continued burning of heavily polluting coal, appears to have effectively blocked inclusion of the president’s Clean Electricity Performance Program, or CEPP, in a sweeping government spending bill, according to multiple sources familiar with the talks.The possibility that Democrats may fail for the second time in 12 years to pass a meaningful climate law, first reported Friday night by The New York Times, has set off a high-stakes scramble to find a plausible alternative, either by salvaging the funding and redirecting it to other programs or pushing through some creative eleventh-hour proposal.Democrats need all 50 senators to pass the multi-trillion-dollar package that contains the bulk of the White House’s political agenda items.The $150 billion clean-electricity program was expected to provide more than 33% of the emissions reductions needed to hit the U.S.’s target by the end of this decade, and tossing it out to save the rest of the package likely forgoes the last opportunity Democrats may have to enshrine greenhouse gas cuts into law before the 2022 election, when Republicans are favored to win back at least one chamber of Congress.“We can’t just cut a program that was going to deliver one-third of the pollution cuts and say that’s acceptable,” said Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert who has advised Senate Democrats throughout the budget negotiations. “The White House better have a Plan B for how we’re going to maintain those cuts.”The electricity sector produces 25% of U.S. emissions, second only to emissions spewed by automobiles. But decarbonizing the economy means swapping internal combustion engines for plug-in cars and oil furnaces for electric boilers, so ensuring a bountiful supply of clean electricity is key to avoiding simply displacing pollution to the power sector.The plan aimed to cut utility sector emissions 80% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade, by paying power companies to increase their output of zero-carbon electricity 4% each year and fining those that don’t. Manchin insisted last week that utilities were already making that change. But just two utilities ― the municipally owned Orlando Utility Commission in Florida and Southern Indian Gas & Electric ― are on track to meet that target, according to company data the advocacy groups Evergreen Action and Natural Resources Defense Council collected.The only other major carbon-cutting policy with comparable mainstream appeal ― specific and well-funded advocacy groups, supportive lawmakers, and successful examples of deployment ― is arguably a carbon tax. But levies on CO2 are far less popular with voters than with economists. That hasn’t stopped some Democrats in Congress from reviving previously ill-fated efforts for a carbon tax and putting new weight on a proposal working its way through the Senate Committee on Finance.On Tuesday, however, Manchin seemed to end speculation that the death of the CEPP might breathe new life into a carbon tax, telling reporters such a proposal was “not on the board at all right now.” While Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has said he would support one — though not likely as part of a broader spending package he opposes — Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) indicated his opposition to a carbon tax.Utility infrastructure is costly, and investments are often planned a decade in advance. The purpose of the CEPP was to influence the speed and direction of that planning. That way, even if a Republican bent on preserving fossil fuels wins the White House in 2024, companies will be unlikely to shift gears.The next best hope for creating such incentives may be to redirect the CEPP’s $150 billion price tag toward beefing up the climate provisions that remain in the budget deal to keep lawmakers from diverting the funds to other programs in the bill, said Sean McElwee, the executive director of the think tank and pollster Data for Progress.That money could fund far bigger Department of Energy grants to states for clean energy, expand existing tax credits for zero-carbon electricity, and boost community solar programs. The bill could also implement a border adjustment tax ― a fee on imports that accounts for the pollution that went into the production of those goods, the first example of which the European Union proposed in July.“If the CEPP is going to be reduced, that money has to be spent on meeting Biden’s climate goals, and we will not meet Biden’s climate goals unless we find other programs that would have the same emissions impact of the CEPP,” McElwee said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.There is little complete or reliable modeling of what alternatives might equal the CEPP’s emissions cuts, though modeling is expected in the coming weeks.A spokesperson for Manchin did not respond to questions about what the senator, who chairs the chamber’s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, sees as the best way for the U.S. to credibly ask other countries to slash emissions at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow next month.On Wednesday, a handful of progressive Democrats held a press conference in Washington, where Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), one of the Senate’s leading climate hawks, vowed to assemble a package with enough clean-energy tax credits and other programs to “match the magnitude” of the emissions crisis.“The Senate must put together a climate package that is something Joe Biden can say to the rest of the world that we are the leaders and not the laggards,” Markey said. “You cannot preach temperance from a bar stool. You cannot tell the rest of the world what to do if you, as a country, are not doing it yourselves.”David Waskow, the international director at the World Resources Institute, said the Biden administration can point to significant steps the White House has taken to cut greenhouse gases when the president himself shows up in Scotland for the first few days of the summit.“U.S. climate action is not happening from scratch ― in just 9 months in office, President Biden already has taken a lot of important strides on tackling the climate crisis that he can showcase in Glasgow,” Waskow said by email. “The negotiations on Capitol Hill are complex, but we are confident that [the] reconciliation package will be enacted with significant climate provisions. What is uncertain is the timing. The legislative process can take some time, which other countries are aware of.”The Environmental Protection Agency vowed to implement regulations on power plants if the legislation fails, mirroring the strategy the Obama administration took after its signature climate proposal died in Congress in 2010. But the Supreme Court temporarily halted the administration’s landmark power plant rule in 2016. And before EPA regulators could work out the legal kinks, Donald Trump won the presidency and named Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who spearheaded the lawsuit to block the power plant rule, as the new agency chief.Climate rules enacted by the White House alone could face the same fate in the next Republican presidency. In the nearer term, the regulations would need to overcome legal challenges in courts now stacked with the droves of federal judges Trump appointed, including a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.“100% clean electricity was a core campaign commitment that President Biden won on,” said Jamal Raad, the executive director of Evergreen Action, which helped lead the charge for the CEPP. “Regardless of CEPP’s inclusion in the final bill, we need to make significant investments to decarbonize the electrical sector, or we will fail to meet our climate commitments.”"}, {"title": "Federal Firefighters Deserve Better Pay And Benefits, Lawmakers Say", "text": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill Tuesday to improve pay and benefits for federal firefighters, who often struggle to eke out a living while doing grueling, life-threatening work.The legislation comes from Reps. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who all represent states that have faced serious wildfire devastation.The bill seeks to raise federal firefighters’ hourly pay to at least $20 an hour and salaries to at least $20,000. It would also guarantee these firefighters receive health care, including robust mental health support; improve their paid leave and retirement benefits; and secure funding for housing and tuition assistance.Unlike municipal firefighters hired by cities and counties, federal firefighters work for agencies such as the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management. They typically respond to large wildland fires.“As these wildfires grow larger and last longer, federal firefighters answer the call of duty, leaving behind their lives and families for months at a time, working an average of 16-hour daily shifts, sleeping in the dirt, with incredibly limited time off to reset and reconnect with loved ones,” Neguse said in a statement. “This must change.”The bill is called the Tim Hart Wildland Firefighter Classification and Pay Parity Act, and is named after a smokejumper from Wyoming who died earlier this year while parachuting into a wildfire in southern New Mexico.Hart’s widow, Michelle Hart, has been among those speaking out about firefighters’ unreasonable conditions and low wages.“They sleep on the ground for weeks, work in smoke without the aid of respiratory protection, endure extreme physical and mental fatigue from 16 hour shifts, and combat dangerous conditions through a ‘fire season’ dramatically extending with each passing year,” she wrote in Cody Enterprise, a Wyoming newspaper, earlier this month.Many are forced to pay rent near the firefighting base while also covering housing costs for their families back home. Sometimes, Michelle Hart said, the temporary housing shortage is so bad that they have nowhere to stay.“Tim lived three summers out of his truck because there was no housing available at his base in Idaho,” she wrote.The low pay ― which is often around $13 an hour for entry-level firefighters ― means many people push themselves beyond their limits to work overtime, she added.The bill’s authors cite some alarming research about the health of firefighters: They die by suicide 30 times as often as the general public, have a 30% increased risk for cardiovascular diseases and have a 43% increased risk for lung cancer. The legislation proposes a week of mental health leave for all federal firefighters and a system for tracking data on firefighters’ health.The federal government’s current treatment of firefighters does not account for the risks they take, advocates say.“Plagued by low wages, extremely long work hours and a retirement plan that doesn’t account for their full annual salary, our firefighters merit pay and benefit plans which recognizes the sacrifices and risks they undertake in the service to our country,” Edward Kelly, the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said in a statement supporting the bill.Michelle Hart also spoke out on Tuesday in support of the legislation, saying in a statement that her husband cared “deeply” about these issues.“Tim would be humbled and honored to have this legislation be a part of his legacy and to represent the hard work and sacrifice of thousands of wildland firefighters,” she said."}, {"title": "Find The Venomous Critter In Georgia's Camouflage Challenge", "text": "The Georgia Department of Natural Resources found a cool way to engage with followers on its Facebook page Monday, challenging them to spot a camouflaged “venomous critter” in a photograph — and then identify the species for bonus points.

This is particularly true if you’re planning to order an artificial Christmas tree this year.“The Christmas tree industry is facing the same challenges as are most of the Christmas-related products ― mainly supply chain issues,” Jami Warner, executive director of the American Christmas Tree Association, told HuffPost.The ACTA is a nonprofit organization and industry trade group that represents those involved in the artificial Christmas tree industry. As with many trade groups, they’re seeing members grapple with major delays and shortages amid the current global supply chain crisis.If you haven’t been keeping up with the coverage, here’s the gist of it: U.S. ports are congested and overwhelmed, as the flow of goods has exceeded unloading capacities. As a result, record numbers of cargo ships are stuck waiting to be unloaded, creating further backlogs.The delivery drivers who transport goods within the U.S. are also overworked and facing their own challenges. Thus, inventory is in short supply and delivery delays are the norm.“Christmas trees, electronics, toys, appliances, computers, cars ― all are experiencing extreme supply chain challenges this season,” Warner said. “We’re all in the same boat, pun intended. Our members have had to scramble for inventory and pay a lot more for it. In some cases, shipping container costs have risen more than 300% over last year.”He noted that the demand for all kinds of Christmas trees was particularly high in 2020 as people were eager to foster a sense of cheer and merriment at home amid the isolation and despair of the pandemic. This year, there’s still a great deal of demand, but artificial tree retailers are struggling.An operations executive at the California-based artificial tree retailer Balsam Hill told Quartz earlier this month that the supply chain disruptions, coupled with the short sales window for Christmas trees, have created a logistical nightmare for his industry.“It’s a constant struggle,” he said, noting that he’s “fighting for space” on cargo ships and watching delivery date estimates inch closer and closer to Christmas.Many consumers prefer artificial Christmas trees to the real deal because they generally don’t shed needles, require no watering or upkeep and aren’t at risk for pest infestations. There are also a number of pre-lit options and fun color choices.But from an environmental perspective, fake trees probably aren’t the best move. The majority are imported from China, and they’re often made with non-recyclable plastic linked to adverse health and environmental effects.Still, you can turn your artificial tree choice into a more eco-friendly option if you purchase one that’s manufactured domestically with less problematic materials, and reuse it year after year. Look for a “Made In USA” label or note in the online product description.With the supply chain challenges of the moment, some consumers who were planning to go artificial might have no choice but to purchase a real tree from a lot or farm this year. But Warner is cautiously optimistic about the fake tree market ― at least for those who can think ahead.“While we expect that consumers will still be able to find a Christmas tree this season, we recommend that they buy early,” Warner advised.So if you’re a fan of faux firs (and you celebrate the holiday), it’s time to look at your options and select your holiday centerpiece.“Consumers should look forward to safely gathering with their families around a Christmas tree of their choice,” Warner said. “And there are so many wonderful, exciting choices ― from the traditional to the funky. There is a Christmas tree out there for everyone.”"}, {"title": "California Just Recorded Its Driest Year In Nearly A Century", "text": "California, which has been plagued by some of its worst droughts and wildfires in recent years, just recorded its driest year in nearly a century, according to data that state water officials released earlier this month.The 2021 water year ― a period that ran from Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021 ― marked the least rainfall since 1924 and was the second driest year since the state started tracking the metric 125 years ago.“[E]xtreme conditions that once were rare are occurring with increased frequency,” the state’s Department of Water Resources said. “California’s climate is transitioning to a warmer setting in which historical relationships among temperature, precipitation, and runoff are changing.”Several areas ― including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento ― experienced less than half of their average annual rainfall, the report found. Overall, California was one of the driest states in the western U.S. last year.The 2020 water year was quite dry as well, and had the fifth lowest rainfall on record.“This two-year dry period continues the theme of aridity California has been experiencing in the 21st century, including the three-year drought of 2007-2009 and the five-year one of 2012-2016,” the department said. A very wet 2017 water year offered a brief reprieve, but drought began returning in 2018.Snowpack in the Sierra-Cascades mountain area in the spring was 60% of average, the department said, indicating potentially grim water supply conditions going forward. Fifty of California’s 58 counties are currently under emergency drought proclamations, and residents have been asked to reduce water consumption.The summer months were especially arid and marked the driest July, August and September since the state started keeping such records around the turn of the 20th century.The continued dryness adds literal fuel to California’s greatest existential threat: massive, record-breaking wildfires. Some of the worst blazes in state history have ripped across California in recent years, burning down entire communities and creating hospitable conditions for other natural disasters.The 2021 water year included the Dixie fire, which started in July and is still burning in some areas.

The agency also is moving to designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the so-called Superfund law that allows the EPA to force companies responsible for the contamination to pay for the cleanup work or do it themselves.The actions will make it easier for the EPA to ensure that cleanups are conducted safely and that “the polluter pays for that,″ Regan said.The regulatory strategy comes as Congress considers wide-ranging legislation to set a national drinking water standard for certain PFAS chemicals and clean up contaminated sites across the country, including military bases where high rates of PFAS have been discovered.PFAS is short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are used in nonstick frying pans, water-repellent sports gear, stain-resistant rugs and countless other consumer products. The chemical bonds are so strong that they don’t degrade or do so only slowly in the environment and remain in a person’s bloodstream indefinitely.Legislation passed by the House would set a national drinking water standard for PFAS and direct the EPA to develop discharge limits for a range of industries suspected of releasing PFAS into the water. The bill has stalled in the Senate.While Regan welcomes congressional action, he said the EPA has authority to act on its own.“You know, PFAS contamination has been devastating communities for decades now, even before we knew how dangerous these chemicals were,″ he told the AP.A former North Carolina environmental regulator who took over as the EPA head in March, Regan said he saw firsthand in his home state how dangerous PFAS can be.As North Carolina’s top environmental official, Regan led negotiations that resulted in the cleanup of the Cape Fear River, which has been dangerously contaminated by PFAS industrial compounds that were released for decades from a manufacturing plant run by a spinoff of chemical giant DuPont.“I spent time with families in their communities, talking to them about the fears and worries that they had,″ said Regan, who was set to announce the EPA actions Monday at a news conference in Raleigh. “I spent time talking to mothers who were concerned about potential long-term impacts to their children, caregivers who were wondering if terminal illnesses of their loved ones were connected” to the PFAS release from the Fayetteville Works plant.“So there is a real sense of urgency,″ he added. “And in North Carolina, we moved forward. We followed the law and the science, and we held the polluter accountable.″Still, he said the state would have been in a stronger position “if the federal government would have been a better, stronger partner.″The EPA under his leadership has “done more in eight months” on PFAS than the previous administration did in four years, Regan said.Officials expect a proposed rule on PFAS in drinking water by 2023, Regan said. “We’re going to move as quickly as possible to set these safe drinking water limits,″ he said.Action on PFAS will not be done “on the backs of the American people,″ Regan added. “We are holding the polluters accountable, and we’re using the full extent of our statutory authority to be sure that they pay for what they’ve done.″"}, {"title": "Money For Green Energy Creates More Jobs Than Fossil Fuel Investment, New Study Finds", "text": "As Congress debates whether to pare down the Biden administration’s signature climate proposals or allow the fossil fuel industry to benefit more from new government programs, new research suggests doing so would create far fewer jobs.For every million dollars the United States government invests, solar produces over 2.7 times more jobs than fossil fuels, according to an analysis from two environmental think tanks and a labor union. Wind energy spurs over 2.8 times more jobs than investments in oil, gas and coal. And retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient creates demand for nearly three times as many jobs.The findings appear to hold true across the world.The paper ― which the World Resources Institute, New Climate Economy, and the International Trade Union Confederation published Monday ― reviewed a dozen studies from 2009 to 2020 and compared the projected job numbers in Brazil, China, Indonesia, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, the United States and globally.Dollar for dollar, solar energy creates a global average of 1.5 times as many jobs as investing the same money into fossil fuels. Geothermal energy generates over 1.7 times as many jobs. Building efficiency retrofits spur 2.8 times more jobs.Green jobs with even lower capital costs, such as paying workers to rehabilitate wetlands or plant trees, made for an even starker comparison with expensive fossil fuel production, creating nearly four times as many jobs.Compared to building new roads, constructing mass transit systems created 1.4 times as many jobs globally, the paper found. (For the U.S., that figure fell slightly, to 1.2.)“If you want economic stimulus, green investments are a better option,” said Joel Jaeger, a researcher at the World Resources Institute and the paper’s lead author. “Continuing to funnel money to unsustainable infrastructure rather than green infrastructure doesn’t make sense for the climate, but it also doesn’t make sense for workers. So there is a win-win opportunity here.”Putting aside the obvious need to avert the trillions of dollars in damage climate change is projected to cause, the counterargument to going all-in on clean investments is that fossil fuel jobs still tend to pay slightly more in most countries. That, Jaeger said, is primarily due to the fact that unions have had decades more to bargain good contracts for workers mining coal or drilling oil and gas.But a recent paper from Princeton University researchers concluded that paying clean-energy workers higher wages would increase their productivity enough to offset higher labor costs and maintain a steady pace of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables. Requiring union labor or prevailing wages for projects that benefit from government spending would help make solar and wind jobs as well-paid as building pipelines or pumping oil.The picture the new research paints is not all rosy for jobs in the automotive sector. Electric vehicles are, on the whole, expected to create more jobs across the economy as plug-in drivers increase demand for electricity, a sector that is more labor-intensive than oil production. But electric vehicles require fewer jobs in manufacturing and maintenance than internal combustion engine cars, meaning many of those workers would need to be retrained or reemployed elsewhere. (Jaeger said determining how best to do so is the subject of his next research project.)Nor is the picture complete. The research largely overlooked nuclear power and carbon capture technology, two more controversial and costly ways to generate electricity without planet-heating pollution. The report does not look at all at technology to remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, a nascent but necessary sector that could at full scale employ upward of 300,000 people in the U.S. alone, according to a 2020 study from the Rhodium Group consultancy.Still, the findings “will absolutely resonate with the labor movement,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a consortium of labor unions and environmental groups.“One of the most important findings of the report is the very straightforward conclusion that a green economy is a more labor-intensive economy,” said Walsh, whose group was not involved in the research.Policies to promote green investments are also already popular. Two-thirds of voters across party lines support federal investments into clean energy jobs, according to polls from the Democratic think tank Data for Progress.“This new research further proves what folks in the climate movement have long argued: Investments in our climate and environment are indeed good for the economy,” said Marcela Mulholland, the political director at Data for Progress, which was not involved in the study. “At a time when polling shows that voters have increased concerns about jobs and climate, it’s really a no-brainer for the federal government to prioritize green investments to put our economy back on track. It’s good politics and good policy.”"}, {"title": "Massive Cargo Ship Dragged California Oil Pipeline: Coast Guard", "text": "Investigators believe a 1,200-foot (366-meter) cargo ship dragging anchor in rough seas caught an underwater oil pipeline and pulled it across the seafloor, months before a leak from the line fouled the Southern California coastline with crude.A team of federal investigators trying to chase down the cause of the spill boarded the Panama-registered MSC DANIT just hours after the massive ship arrived this weekend off the Port of Long Beach, the same area where the leak was discovered in early October.During a prior visit by the ship during a heavy storm in January, investigators believe its anchor dragged for an unknown distance before striking the 16-inch (40-centimeter) steel pipe, Coast Guard Lt. j.g. SondraKay Kneen said Sunday.The impact would have knocked an inch-thick concrete casing off the pipe and pulled it more than 100 feet (30 meters), bending but not breaking the line, Kneen said.Still undetermined is whether the impact caused the October leak, or if the line was hit by something else at a later date or failed due to a preexisting problem, Kneen said.“We’re still looking at multiple vessels and scenarios,” she said.The Coast Guard on Saturday designated the owner and operator as parties of interest in its investigation into the spill, estimated to have released about 25,000 gallons (94,635 liters) of crude into the water, killing birds, fish and mammals.The accident just a few miles off Los Angeles’ Huntington Beach fouled beaches and wetlands and led to temporary closures for cleanup work . While not as bad as initially feared, it has reignited the debate over offshore drilling in federal waters in the Pacific, where  hundreds of miles of pipelines were installed decades ago.The DANIT’s operator, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, is headquartered in Switzerland and has a fleet of 600 vessels and more than 100,000 workers, according to the company.MSC representatives did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment. A security guard reached by telephone at the company’s headquarters in Geneva said it was closed until Monday.The vessel’s owner, identified by the Coast Guard as Dordellas Finance Corporation, could not be reached for comment.The DANIT arrived in Long Beach this weekend after voyaging from China, according to marine traffic monitoring websites.The investigation into what caused the spill could lead to criminal charges or civil penalties,  but none have been announced yet, and Kneen said the probe could continue for months.Attorneys for MSC and Dordellas will have the chance to examine and cross-examine the government’s witnesses in the case and also to call their own witnesses, according to the Coast Guard. The investigation also includes the National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies.Kneen declined to say if any damage was found to an anchor on the DANIT after a team of at least five investigators spent much of Saturday aboard the ship.At least two other vessels were previously boarded by investigators, who are examining logs kept by the ships’ captains, officers and engineers and voyage data recorders — equivalent to the so-called black box on airplanes.In response to the new focus on the DANIT, the Houston-based owner of the damaged pipeline, Amplify Energy, thanked the Coast Guard for its continued work on the case.Amplify representatives have not directly responded to questions about an hourslong delay between an alarm indicating a potential problem with the pipeline and the company reporting the leak to federal authorities."}, {"title": "Sea Otters Are Adorable Stewards Of Underwater Sea Grass Meadows", "text": "It turns out when sea otters are foraging for dinner, they’re also doing a huge favor to the ecosystem.According to new research, the critters have positive effect on sea grass meadows, a crucial part of the underwater environment that help stabilize the ocean floor, improve water quality and serve as food for some species and habitat for others.Sea otters disturb these meadows when they dig for clams, and their presence is marked by bare patches and indentations from all the digging, according to National Geographic. Though some might assume that means otters aren’t so great for the grass, ecologist Jane Watson noticed in the 1990s that where sea otters thrived, so did sea grass, The New York Times reported.Decades later, Watson’s idea inspired her former student, Erin Foster, to lead a study on the matter. Watson, who conducted the seagrass research while completing a PhD at the University of Victoria, co-authored a paper on the findings, which was published Friday in the journal Science.As it turned out, Watson was right all along. The researchers studied meadows of eelgrass ― a type of sea grass ― in British Columbia, and found that they had significantly higher genetic diversity in areas where otters were present. Not only that, but the longer that otters had been living in a particular area, the higher the genetic diversity among the eelgrass.So how do otters do this? The answer has to do with the fact that eelgrass can reproduce two ways ― clonally or sexually. Clonally basically means that each new plant is genetically identical to its predecessor; sexually means that the plants reproduce via pollination, and that each new plant has genetic material from each of its parent plants. The researchers believe that otters disturbing the grass specifically encourages sexual reproduction in the eelgrass, which creates a more genetically diverse meadow.That’s good news for the grass, which is vulnerable to numerous threats, from climate change-fueled ocean acidification and warming water temperatures to pollution from fertilizer runoff and severe disruption from human activities like dredging for development. More genetic diversity gives the grass a better shot of long-term survival.“Genetic diversity typically builds resilience to change, and considering the challenges we’re facing ... this will be important for eelgrass meadows,” Foster told National Geographic."}, {"title": "600-lb Stranded Sea Turtle Splashes Back Into The Ocean After Rescue", "text": "A very big sea turtle is swimming free again after a team effort to help the hefty animal.The 5-foot-long, 600-pound adult male leatherback was spotted stranded on a Cape Cod, Massachusetts, mudflat on Sunday. Rescuers with the Mass Audubon Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary showed up quickly to keep the distressed turtle from drifting somewhere harder for people to access, local news station WHDH reported.The organization then joined forces with the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the New England Aquarium to transport the turtle and get him the care he needed.That involved moving the big guy in a “heavy-duty” cart typically used for dolphins and small whales, according to an IFAW statement.Sea turtle strandings happen in the fall in Cape Cod when temperatures drop and turtles aren’t able to figure out how to swim out of Cape Cod Bay to make way for warmer waters, according to the Cape Cod Times.In this case, the turtle was in relatively good health despite his predicament.“When working with stranded sea turtles in New England, it’s a rarity to have a turtle that is in such good condition,” Dr. Kara Dodge, a research scientist with the New England Aquarium, told CapeCod.com.Responders moved the turtle to Herring Cove in Provincetown, where he received injections of vitamins and an anti-inflammatory before being released. (You can watch the joyous event in the video above.) He also got a satellite tag to let researchers track his whereabouts going forward.Dodge added that the turtle had likely simply become “disoriented,” and that “we feel optimistic” he’ll be OK."}, {"title": "Scottish Dunes Trump Promised To Protect On His Golf Course Are Ruined", "text": "Environmentally critical coastal sand dunes on Donald Trump’s Scottish golf course in Aberdeenshire have been ruined, even though Trump promised to protect them.The dunes “will be there forever,” Trump vowed in 2008 to quell concerns about his new course. “This will be environmentally better after [the course] is built than it is before.”But late last year officials announced that the dunes had lost their status as a protected environmental site because they had been partially destroyed.Following construction of the Trump International Golf Links north of Aberdeen, the dunes no longer “merit being retained as part of the site of special scientific interest,” declared Scotland’s nature agency NatureScot.“There is now no longer a reason to protect the dunes ... as they do not include enough of the special, natural features for which they were designated,” said the agency.The drastic change was already vividly apparent in overhead photos of the Foveran Links dunes in 2019 (see clip above).It’s even more dramatic in before and after photos of the dunes from 2010 and 2021 obtained by Business Insider that can be seen here.NatureScot once called the dunes “a very high-quality example of a sand dune system characteristic of northeast Scotland, and was of exceptional importance for the wide variety of coastal landforms and processes.”When the dunes lost their special designation, Bob Ward, the policy and communications director at the London School of Economics’ Climate Change Research Institute, told The Guardian: “This is a bitterly disappointing decision, which shows that golf still trumps the environment when it comes to Scotland’s natural heritage.”Trump claimed he would “stabilize” the dunes, which apparently meant building on them. But that stopped the natural movement of the dunes as they respond to environmental fluctuations, Ward told Business Insider. “Essentially what they’ve done is they’ve just killed it as a natural environment,” he said.Trump’s vow that his Aberdeenshire course and a second one at Turnberry would bring welcome economic benefits to the area have also fallen flat.The Trump Organization’s financial filings early this year reported a $4.6 million annual loss at the Scottish courses, which boosted the total red ink for the operations over eight years to an eye-popping $75 million. Trump hasn’t paid a penny in tax on the properties. In fact, the courses collected $800,000 in taxpayer subsidies during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect jobs, then cut workers, union officials complained.The filings, covering 2019, didn’t yet reflect the business-downturn toll of the COVID-19 pandemic.Global activist organization Avaaz has filed a court action to press the Scottish government to wield its popularly known “McMafia” law to force Trump to reveal the mysterious sources for his all-cash purchases and development of his Scottish golf resorts. At the time of Trump’s purchases, he was heavily in debt and banks were reluctant to loan money to him.Accounting for the president’s Scottish resorts is unusual because Trump is the creditor for his own businesses, which means payment for many of the resorts’ costs flow to the Trump Organization.The circular flow of money in the Trump companies provides an opportunity for money laundering, The New Yorker business writer Adam Davidson has suggested. He called the resorts “money disappearing” operations.Trump “owns the asset, lends the money, owes the money, is owed the money,” Davidson explained. “Every year, Trump lends millions to himself, spends all that money on something, and claims the asset is worth all the money he spent.”Trump Organization officials could not immediately be reached for comment."}, {"title": "William Shatner Blasts Back At Prince William's Criticism Of Space Tourism", "text": "Recent rocket passenger William Shatner responded to Prince William’s criticism of space tourism for the wealthy while the Earth continues to be plagued by environmental problems.Shatner, 90, became the oldest individual ever to fly into space on Wednesday when he rocketed out of Earth’s atmosphere with three other passengers aboard the New Shepard NS-18 ship, built by Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon’s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos.The Duke of Cambridge slammed such flights as abandoning Earth and exacerbating pollution here.“We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the prince told the BBC when asked about climate change in an interview that aired Thursday. “It really is quite crucial to be focusing on this [planet] rather than giving up and heading out into space.”The prince added that there is the “fundamental question” of the space flights’ carbon cost, and he noted that he has “absolutely no interest” in going to space.“If we’re not careful we’re robbing from our children’s future through what we do now. And I think that’s not fair,” he said.But Prince William has “got the wrong idea,” Shatner told Entertainment Tonight on Thursday.“The idea here is not to go, ‘Yeah, look at me. I’m in space,’” the legendary actor said. “I would tell the prince, and I hope the prince gets the message, this is a baby step into the idea of getting industry up there, so that all those polluting industries ... off of Earth.”The actor said operations could be built “250, 280 miles above the Earth” to then “send that power down here, and they catch it, and they then use it, and it’s there.”All it “needs is ... somebody as rich as Jeff Bezos [to say], ‘Let’s go up there,’” Shatner said, adding again that Prince William is “missing the point.”The “point is these are the baby steps to show people [that] it’s very practical. You can send somebody like me up into space,” the actor said.Shatner said he agreed with the prince that there are issues that must be addressed on Earth, “but we can curl your hair and put lotion on your face at the same time,” he added.Shatner, who was very emotional  after his 10-minute flight, said it was incredibly special, like “holding your child for the first time.”That’s an “overwhelming experience, and I had that experience,” he said."}, {"title": "Queen Elizabeth Criticizes Those Who 'Talk, But Don't Do' Regarding Climate Change", "text": "Queen Elizabeth experienced a hot mic of sorts at the opening of Welsh parliament in Cardiff on Thursday.The queen was seen and heard conversing with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Welsh politician Elin Jones about the upcoming United Nations climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders will gather to talk about climate change.“I’ve been hearing all about COP ... still don’t know who is coming ... no idea,” the monarch appeared to say on video captured by Daily Mirror reporter Russell Meyers. “We only know about people who are not coming. ... It’s really irritating when they talk, but they don’t do.”“Exactly,” Jones responded. “It’s a time for doing. And watching your grandson on the television this morning saying there’s no point going to space, we need to save the Earth ...”The queen rarely ― if ever ― publicly shares an opinion, and her role is a politically neutral one.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News that “comments made in private should stay private,” in reference to the monarch’s conversation getting media attention.“We all share the desire to see progress made and we know there will be hundreds of leaders coming to Glasgow for COP,” he said.The queen’s reported comments echo Prince Charles’ conversation with BBC earlier this week, during which he told the outlet that he was worried that leaders would “just talk,” rather than actually do something at the upcoming summit.“The problem is to get action on the ground,” the royal said, while empathizing with activists who are upset.“All these young people feel nothing is ever happening, so of course they’re going to get frustrated,” Charles, a longtime environmental advocate, added. “I totally understand because nobody would listen, and they see their future being totally destroyed.”Along with the queen and Charles, both Prince William and Prince Harry voiced concerns about environmental issues this week.The Duke of Cambridge’s interview with BBC “Newscast” continues to make front pages around the globe, and on Sunday, he will announce the inaugural winner of his Earthshot Prize, which is “designed to incentivize change and help to repair our planet over the next 10 years.”On Thursday, Harry launched a campaign ― alongside the nonprofit group Re:Wild ― to stop the Canadian oil company ReconAfrica from drilling in Africa’s Okavango River Basin.The Duke of Sussex and Reinhold Mangundu, a Namibian environmental activist, co-authored an opinion piece for The Washington Post about the company’s plans for the basin and all the ways in which drilling would affect the people and animals that live there.Despite the royals’ continued activism in the environmental space, members of the family have been and still are routinely criticized for taking private planes and helicopters for travel, maintaining vast estates, and, as a recent report from The Guardian shows, secretly lobbying to remain exempt from climate laws.Subscribe to HuffPost’s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond)."}, {"title": "The Battle Over The Last Piece Of Puerto Rico That Wasn’t For Sale", "text": "RINCÓN, Puerto Rico ― To the west, a giant flaming peach of a sun sank into the horizon. Warm Caribbean waves lapped on the soft sandy shoreline where pregnant turtles drag themselves from the water each season to lay their eggs among mangroves and coconut palms.To the east, cloistered behind a garrison of plastic orange barricades, dozens of heavily armed police officers paced and revved motorcycle engines, standing guard over gray concrete and construction materials.Between the two, on a stretch of Los Almendros beach this August evening, is a small village of tents flying the black Puerto Rican flag of resistance.“This is a war zone,” Miriam Juan Rivera said, shooting a steely glare at the police.What began this spring as a local protest over the construction of a private pool on a public beach where endangered reptiles nest had, by the end of summer, evolved into a symbolic battle over the future of this island’s treasured waterfronts.For years, virtually everything in Puerto Rico, from the nature preserves to the power utility, had been for sale as the deeply indebted U.S.-owned archipelago struggles to pay back billions of dollars to Wall Street. The beaches ― public access to which is guaranteed under Puerto Rican law ― had long been the exception. But as the local government seeks to remake the island into a hub for mainlanders seeking to avoid taxes, it is finding new and creative ways to claim the waterfront.It’s happening all over the territory. On Vieques, the tiny island off Puerto Rico’s main island, locals who once took on the U.S. Navy and won are now struggling in “a vicious fight for access to the island,” according to a 2019 GlobalPost article, as Airbnb hosts build guesthouses on the beach. On the south coast, in Santa Isabel, the daughter of a former top government official is trying to build a hotel that would block access to a beach beloved by local kite surfers. In Dorado, just 30 minutes west of the capital city of San Juan, YouTube buffoon Logan Paul bought a beachside mansion earlier this year, bragged about flouting income taxes and proceeded to illegally drive a four-wheeler around in sand where turtles nest, declaring it his own.But Rincón offered one of the starkest examples of how the government and wealthy interests have aligned to crush Puerto Ricans’ attempts to preserve ecologically and culturally vital beaches.In late 2019, the board of directors at the luxury Condominios Sol Y Playa started laying plans to not only rebuild a pool destroyed during Hurricane María but expand it several feet onto the neighboring public beach. Sure enough, as environmentalists ― many of them retirees who live in this breezy seaside city ― started gathering at the beach to oppose the project, an army of police arrived in droves from departments as far as four hours away. Police boats patrolled waters where no one was swimming but the toddlers whose parents had come to protest. During one altercation in July, police in riot gear dragged an unarmed woman out by her hair.Standing at the protest camp that formed on the beach, Ruperto Chaparro, director of the University of Puerto Rico’s Sea Grant program, said crushing the demonstrations would send a signal to wealthy Americans considering relocating to Puerto Rico that buying waterfront property here can, in fact, include a piece of Caribbean coastline devoid of actual Puerto Ricans.“My theory is that this is a marketing tool to tell them this can be a private beach,” said Chaparro, whose federally funded group specializes in balancing the ecological and economic needs of coastal areas. “This is ridiculous.”The pool itself wasn’t the point. Putting aside reasonable queries as to why anyone needs a pool just feet from a shallow and quiet stretch of bathtub-warm Caribbean water, the Sol Y Playa condos had long had their own chlorinated swimming hole closer to the actual four-story complex. When Hurricane María lashed the coast with fierce winds and surging seas in 2017, the pool was destroyed. Instead of using the insurance money to rebuild what was previously there, the developers decided to go bigger, building out several feet into the beach itself.The developers at Sol Y Playa did not respond to emailed questions.It didn’t take long for word to get out once construction fences went up and backhoes started digging.There were obvious questions. If the last pool couldn’t withstand María, why would an even bigger pool, closer to the water, survive? Given that scientists say hurricanes are only growing more frequent and destructive as the planet warms, was it even wise to build anything new in the areas nature was so wrathfully reclaiming? The leatherback and hawksbill turtles who nested here were already endangered, shouldn’t their survival trump a new pool? How did this project even get permitted?Ángel Román, the environmental consultant the Sol Y Playa condos hired to assess the project, insisted that the construction met every permitting requirement and could withstand future hurricanes.“We have been extremely responsible in having an environmentally sound project,” he told the local news site NotiCel.Some condo owners at Sol Y Playa disagreed. Concerned over what he believed to be illegal construction, José Barea, 61, a lawyer who owns a unit in the complex, alerted local authorities.“You’ve got to respect that boundary that belongs to the people of Puerto Rico, we have to respect our fellow Puerto Ricans,” Barea said. “We cannot take what doesn’t belong to us.”On May 17, Eliezer Molina, a former gubernatorial candidate and activist with tens of thousands of followers on social media, showed up on Los Almendros beach and broadcast an eight-minute live video in which he showed the construction site and complained that something so blatantly out of step with the area’s ecological constraints could only be approved through corrupt dealings. The video went viral, racking up more than 281,000 views and 10,000 shares on Facebook as of October.Three days later, the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, known by its Spanish acronym DRNA, sent the developers a cease-and-desist letter, forcing the project to halt construction. But just hours later, DRNA chief Rafael Machargo claimed the first order was not clear and reversed course, allowing construction to continue.At the start of July, the ecological toll of the project came into full view when a hawksbill turtle slid under the chain-link fence and laid 180 eggs. The turtle, listed by federal scientists as “endangered” and by the World Wildlife Foundation as “critically endangered,” remained trapped in the construction site until 7 a.m. the following morning, when a guard noticed her.Molina’s accusations quickly gained steam with a corruption-weary public. Two years earlier, up to 1 million Puerto Ricans had protested for weeks after leaked text messages showed close associates of then-Gov. Ricardo Rosselló directing major public contracts to friends and allies and speaking boorishly about those killed in Hurricane María. With as much as one-third of the territory’s population protesting in the streets of the capital, Rosselló had resigned in disgrace.The situation in Rincón didn’t have quite the same stakes, nor were there leaked internal communications directly linking current Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, Rosselló’s handpicked successor, to the swimming pool. But the circumstantial evidence was troubling, at least.As the protests at Los Almendros grew, droves of police arrived, including officers from as far away as Ponce and Bayamón. In total, at least 534 officers stood guard at the construction site, collecting some $630,803 in overtime pay, according to the newspaper El Vocero.That figure doesn’t include what was spent to transport, feed and barricade the police in a makeshift headquarters alongside the condo complex.On an archipelago where, unless you live in a wealthy community, dialing 911 is no guarantee that the police will even arrive, protesters saw the presence of so many armored and armed police as a sign a simple pool had become a political priority of the elite.Adding to that sense was the revelation that Walter Pierluisi Isern, the governor’s first cousin and former campaign political director, owned an apartment at Sol Y Playa.“This is not about a pool, this is about higher decision-making,” said Gloria Cuevas, a retired art teacher who had spent every day protesting. “After María, the island was open, and everyone saw poverty and need, and that, for some people, was an opportunity.”The governor, for his part, defended the police deployment, telling El Vocero that the government has to “allow protest when it happens, but whenever the right to life and property is violated, the police have to be there.”But it was the protesters whose rights were most in jeopardy, according to the Puerto Rico chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.By August, there were so many officers gathered by the entrance to Los Almendros beach, a visiting reporter at first mistook the condos for a police headquarters. The officers, many masked and holding guns openly, eyed anyone who walked the roughly 10-foot-wide pathway from the road to the sand and stationed at least one officer at a time at the entrance, as if checking tickets. When not at the beach, police cruised the otherwise peaceful streets of Rincón in groups, sometimes with two squad cars or a trio of motorcycles halting busy traffic to make way for themselves.“There was a young woman who was sitting in the public part of the beach and since she did not stop because she had the right to be there, they took her by the hair and dragged her,” said William Ramírez, the ACLU of Puerto Rico’s executive director. “That is certainly a crime.”On Aug. 4, the governor’s planning board, a separate agency from the DRNA, voted unanimously to declare the pool illegal, yanking its permits.On Los Almendros, the news literally reverberated. The protesters danced and cheered, and those with instruments began playing music. At least a dozen people dove into the water to swim as a small burst of rain clouds dissipated and the sun emerged.In San Juan, critics of the government started looking for who was responsible. The ACLU filed a complaint with the federal government requesting an investigation into police brutality against protesters. Last month, the Puerto Rican House of Representatives issued a report accusing Machargo, the DNRA chief, of intimidating witnesses and refusing to turn over public documents related to the Rincón pool project. The island’s Senate then voted overwhelmingly to order Machargo to answer questions before a hearing.Advocates, meanwhile, demanded Pierluisi fire Machargo.Machargo said the investigation into him had “neither head nor tail” and accused the legislature of “interfering” with the conduct of his executive branch agency, something he said would “create a disastrous precedent.”“We did everything possible to safeguard the process,” Machargo said.A spokesperson for DNRA did not respond to a request for comment. The governor’s office did not return two calls requesting comment.Judith Enck, the former regional Environmental Protection Agency administrator for Puerto Rico under the Obama administration, said federal regulators have little power over land-use decisions in the territory, meaning the buck tends to stop with the sitting governor.“Puerto Rico should have learned the lesson of the need for climate change resiliency, and a central part of that is not constructing things along shorelines,” she said. “The Puerto Rican government should know better.”During the Trump administration, when the White House repeatedly dismissed the concerns of Puerto Ricans and halted money Congress authorized to rebuild the territory, federal agencies had little leeway.“But that money is flowing now,” Enck said. “So there’s a need for stronger federal oversight.”Attention from Capitol Hill has helped elsewhere. At a hearing on federal climate funding for U.S. territories last February, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) pressed Machargo about the plans to build a hotel in another Puerto Rican municipality, Santa Isabel, that would cut off the community’s access to the beach. Machargo seemed flustered.“According to the law of the government of Puerto Rico, everybody should have access to the beach. That would be illegal to cut people from access to the beach,” Machargo told the congressman. “I will take note of that case and I will look into it to see if they have all the permits.”Eierí Ossorio, 40, an avid kitesurfer who grew up near the proposed hotel in Santa Isabel, credited local organizing for upending the proposed development in his town. But he said the federal scrutiny helped.“It’s been almost a year,” he said. “And they haven’t built a hotel anywhere.”In Rincón, the construction equipment has idled and most of the police have left. But the partially dug pool remains as the condo board fights in court to have the permits reinstated. Some protesters have remained on the beach, keeping watch. Barea, who began receiving routine threats to his family after he publicly opposed the project, said he has not returned to his unit at Sol Y Playa since June.The coastline is already dotted with new buildings. But some hope the issue could mark a turning point in the fight to keep Puerto Rico’s beaches open.“This is where people can go for fun for free, so, by doing this, they are increasing our vulnerability and reducing our resiliency when we have climate change,” Chaparro, the Sea Grant director, said. “We should be taking climate change seriously in our development plans.”Yet, in Puerto Rico, disregard for ecological boundaries is the longstanding norm. Back in 1997, DNRA surveyors had determined that the protections for Los Almendros beach weren’t sufficient, according to a recently resurfaced report. Despite that finding, construction crews broke ground the next year on a luxury development. Its name? Sol Y Playa."}, {"title": "Bianca Graulau Is Documenting Puerto Rico's Disappearing Beaches On TikTok And YouTube", "text": "A 45-minute drive from where Bianca Graulau lives in Camuy, Puerto Rico, sits her favorite beach. Beige specks of sand stretch along Crash Boat Beach in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, where you can surf and munch on some local food. This is where Graulau, a 31-year-old puertorriqueña, spent her summers and Christmas breaks as a young adult.She wasn’t there for any of the hype, though. Graulau would often go to catch up with her aunt, who preferred a spot away from the crowds right along some rocks. That used to be her routine — back when that part of the beach still existed.It’s gone now. The ocean’s eaten it up.“The water hits the rocks now,” said Graulau over Zoom with her long dark hair in its signature style: natural loose waves down her shoulders. “I visited the beach again, and I was like, ‘Oh, my god. Where did the beach go?’”This topic — sea level rise and erosion swallowing Puerto Rico’s beaches — was the subject of Graulau’s first YouTube video in 2019. Since then, the journalist has accrued nearly 40,000 subscribers on YouTube and more than 326,000 followers on TikTok.Graulau continues to cover the transformation of Puerto Rico on her various platforms. It’s a transformation she’s now dedicating to capturing, documenting and sharing with the world. That first video now has over 1.4 million views.“That video really resonated because everyone is seeing it,” Graulau said. “If you’ve grown up in Puerto Rico going to a specific beach, you have been seeing it slowly disappearing.”That’s what makes Graulau’s storytelling so special: She connects. She dares to do what few other journalists would on camera: She gets personal. “It allows me to communicate with my viewers and followers as a fellow human,” Graulau said, “as a fellow Puerto Rican who’s going through the same issues as the rest of the population here.”She often talks directly to local community members and experts in her videos. She loves to hop on the latest TikTok trend, but she also asks the hard questions. Graulau is unapologetic and unafraid.She has worked hard to reach this place where she’s comfortable and confident in her own skin. She spent years doing TV news where bosses told her to straighten her hair and lose her accent. Image was everything. In 2020, she finally quit. She wanted to work for herself and call the shots.“I think being independent sort of removes that part of you that’s always asking, ‘Oh, what are the bosses going to think about this?’” Graulau said. “Now, I worry about my audience.”She focuses mostly on the issues at home — and she’s already leaving an impression across the archipelago. Ivonne del C. Díaz, an environmental economics professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, used Graulau’s video on sea-level rise in the classroom.The video isn’t just about the oceans rising. It also shows the economic disparities that exist in Puerto Rico — and the varying ways climate change impacts different communities. While private developers can afford to buy up beaches, local families who have had these views for free for generations must now wrestle with the reality that they may lose all they have.“You can see her concern,” Díaz said in response to the video in Spanish. “This work is important because, sometimes, we talk about these issues in the classroom, and it feels distant to students. After seeing these types of videos, the students can see how much she cares, and it feels more real.”Díaz can’t recall how she found Graulau’s work, but she remembers enjoying how original and interactive it was. The economics professor knew the video would help her students link economic issues to environmental and social problems, too.And that’s all intentional in Graulau’s stories. Lately, she’s been thinking a lot about colonization and the way that history interacts with the ongoing climate crisis. Her latest pieces reflect that interest: “Does the United States still own colonies?” is the newest video on Graulau’s YouTube channel.However, the effects of that first sea-level rise video — the one that kicked off Graulau’s independent career — are still rippling throughout her own life. One of Graulau’s best friends, America Arias, worked on the video with her. Arias, a fellow TV news producer, makes an appearance taking notes while Graulau interviews a local oceanographer. The pair met in Puerto Rico some 12 years ago at a conference for the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. The two Latinas didn’t kick it off right away, but they became inseparable after 2012.Graulau and Arias were both living in Sacramento, California, working at local stations and feeling professionally unfulfilled. By 2016, the two journalists took a risk that changed their lives. They spent a month creating unpaid content just for themselves. They went to North Dakota for a week to cover the Standing Rock movement. They visited the U.S.-Mexico border together. Arias hadn’t been since she crossed illegally as a little girl and she wanted to tell stories from the region.Despite having protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Arias was nervous. The sound of helicopters was triggering. By the third visit, the team got enough for a story.And yet Graulau never pushed her. She was always patient. And the stories truly mattered. “We were so happy to be chasing the stories that we really cared about,” Arias said. You can hear the respect in her voice when she talks about how far her best friend has come since those early days in California.Graulau was a fast-fashion consumer back then. She’d buy a ton of cheap clothes and jewelry to look the part and keep her superiors pleased. Nowadays, she makes videos on how to buy less. Graulau walks the talk. Her birthday in March was the last time Arias saw her. The birthday girl “hates buying new stuff,” Arias said, so she gifted her used items she collected from garage sales over two months: ceramic planters, clothes, a rug. She also packed the ingredients to bake the perfect vegan, gluten-free cake. They stayed up late that night, eating cake and catching up.“We had a moment where I told her I was really proud of her,” Arias said, her voice breaking. No gift she gave the birthday girl could measure up to what Graulau has gifted her: the opportunity to witness her grow and thrive. Arias described her friend not as a different person but as “the person she always needed to become.”“How lucky am I to witness that?” she said, “and she’s just getting started.”"}, {"title": "Prince William: Saving Earth Should Come Before Space Tourism", "text": "Prince William has criticized the space race and space tourism, saying we should be focussing on protecting planet Earth instead.“We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the Duke of Cambridge said when asked about climate change.Prince William was interviewed by BBC “Newscast” on BBC Sounds ahead of the first Earthshot Prize awards, a reward for people who are trying to save the planet.The duke also warned the Cop26 summit, where world leaders will gather in Glasgow at the end of the month, against “clever speak, clever words but not enough action.”“I think for COP to communicate very clearly and very honestly what the problems are and what the solutions are going to be, is critical,” he said.“We can’t have more clever speak, clever words but not enough action.”The duke expressed his worries about a rise in climate anxiety in young people, and said it would be an “absolute disaster” if his eldest son, Prince George, was having to talk about the same issue in 30 years’ time when it was too late.“We are seeing a rise in climate anxiety. You know, people, young people now are growing up where their futures are basically threatened the whole time. It’s very unnerving and it’s very, you know, anxiety making,” he said.William added that his father the Prince of Wales, who is known for his long-standing commitment to green issues, had a “really rough ride” when he first started talking about climate change.The duke, who was interviewed by “Newscast” presenter Adam Fleming, said his late grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh had started the royal interest in environmental issues.When speaking about his father Charles, Prince William said: “It’s been a hard road for him. My grandfather started off helping out WWF a long time ago with its nature work and biodiversity, and I think that my father’s sort of progressed that on and talked about climate change a lot more, very early on, before anyone else thought it was a topic. So yes, he’s had a really rough ride on that, and I think you know he’s been proven to being well ahead of the curve.”He added that his viewpoint had changed since he had his own children, saying: “I want the things that I’ve enjoyed – the outdoor life, nature, the environment – I want that to be there for my children, and not just my children but everyone else’s children.“If we’re not careful we’re robbing from our children’s future through what we do now. And I think that’s not fair.”The winners in the five categories this year will each receive £1 million to develop their projects after being chosen by a judging panel. William and the Duchess of Cambridge are attending the star-studded ceremony, hosted by Clara Amfo and Dermot O’Leary, at Alexandra Palace in London on Sunday.“The prize itself will stimulate solutions and action that a lot of people haven’t necessarily produced yet, and so I’m hoping, you know, the prize will galvanise a lot of people in positions of responsibility to, you know, go further, bigger and actually start to deliver,” the duke said.Cop26 is the deadline by which countries are expected to bring forward more ambitious plans, under a five-year cycle, to get the world on track to meet the Paris goals.The 2015 Paris Agreement commits countries to keeping temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit them to 1.5C – beyond which the most dangerous climate impacts will be felt.The conference begins in Glasgow on October 31.Subscribe to HuffPost’s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond)."}, {"title": "White House Announces Plans For Massive Expansion Of Offshore Wind Farms", "text": "The Biden administration unveiled plans to develop large, grid-transforming offshore wind farms along much of the U.S. coastline in the coming years, a major effort to invest in renewable energy and combat the growing impacts of climate change.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Wednesday the government would begin work to identify seven major zones where it could lease federal waters to offshore wind development. Auctions could take place by 2025, a major step toward President Joe Biden’s pledges to build 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030, an amount that would power up to 10 million homes.“The Interior Department is laying out an ambitious roadmap as we advance the Administration’s plans to confront climate change, create good-paying jobs, and accelerate the nation’s transition to a cleaner energy future,” Haaland said. “We have big goals to achieve a clean energy economy, and Interior is meeting the moment.”The proposed areas include almost the entire East Coast from Maine down to the Carolinas, the Gulf of Mexico, and coastline along Oregon and California. The plan is an aggressive move that would aid the White House’s goals to slash the nation’s fossil fuel emissions by the end of the decade and meet targets scientists have long stressed are needed to avert the worst effects of climate change.Biden has pledged to cut the nation’s fossil fuel emissions — potent greenhouse gases ― by 50% of 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. is a latecomer to offshore wind, which has been heavily deployed across much of Europe.The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, a branch of the DOI, said the new projects could create nearly 80,000 jobs. The Associated Press notes Haaland is also working to increase renewable energy production on land, including greater investment in wind and solar power by 2025.While the plans could revolutionize the U.S. power grid, they still face uphill battles. The New York Times reports that even if the sites pass lengthy regulatory reviews, there is no guarantee companies will lease the space to build the turbines. The newspaper adds that offshore wind projects have also been subject to lawsuits from commercial fishing groups and coastal landowners, and oil and gas companies could claim that the renewable projects might damage their own business models.Interior Department officials said they plan to work closely with industry stakeholders to “establish confidence” in the offshore wind plans.The Department of Energy also said Wednesday it would spend $13.5 million to study the risks of offshore wind development to wildlife, including birds, bats and marine mammals.“Harnessing the incredible potential that exists within offshore wind energy is an essential piece of reaching a net-zero carbon future,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement. “In order for Americans living in coastal areas to see the benefits of offshore wind, we must ensure that it’s done with care for the surrounding ecosystem by co-existing with fisheries and marine life — and that’s exactly what this investment will do.”The Biden administration only approved the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in May — the Vineyard Wind project, which lies about 12 nautical miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The project is expected to generate about 800 megawatts of electricity that could power up to 400,000 homes."}, {"title": "Utah Republicans Shamelessly Invoke Tribes To Condemn Biden’s Monument Restorations", "text": "As news broke last week that President Joe Biden would restore the boundaries of a pair of national monuments in Utah that former President Donald Trump reduced four years ago, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) condemned the move on Twitter.Reexpanding the boundaries of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments “is a devastating blow to our state, local and tribal leaders and our delegation,” Romney wrote, adding that Biden had “squandered the opportunity to build consensus by working with stakeholders to find a permanent, legislative solution.”In an opinion piece published in the Deseret News and titled “A monumental insult,” Romney, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and the rest of Utah’s congressional delegation argued that Bears Ears, and presumably Biden’s restoration, “fails to include the crucial input and involvement of local tribes in protecting and highlighting their own cultural heritage.”It’s no secret that Utah Republicans fervently opposed Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears when President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama created them in 1996 and 2016, respectively, and lobbied for Trump’s rollbacks. State leaders have a long history of attacking public land protections.But portraying tribes as agreeing with them is nothing short of dishonest.Their statements “reflects a fundamental misunderstanding, or a complete ignorance, of Indian law and policy,” said Pat Gonzales-Rogers, executive director of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, a consortium of the five tribes that petitioned Obama to make Bears Ears a monument. “The tribes are their own unique sovereigns. Senator Romney does not speak for them.”“Frankly, some of this sounds like sour grapes,” Gonzales-Rogers added.Utah Republicans did not elaborate on their sweeping claims that Biden’s action somehow harms or offends tribes, and Romney and Lee’s offices did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Bears Ears is the first and only national monument established at the direct request of sovereign tribes. The landscape is home to more than 100,000 known cultural and archaeological sites, including ancient rock art panels and cliff dwellings, and five tribes — the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni and the Ute Indian Tribe — consider the area sacred.Grand Staircase-Escalante is also rich in both archeological and paleontological resources. The landscape makes up a portion of the Southern Paiute people’s ancestral homelands and numerous other tribes have historical ties to the area.When Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended shrinking Bears Ears in 2017, the Bears Ears tribal coalition condemned it as “a slap in the face to the members of our Tribes and an affront to Indian people all across the country.”When Trump followed through and reduced the monument’s size by 85%, the coalition promptly sued. And when Biden signed a proclamation on Friday to restore the monument to its original size, the coalition celebrated it as a recognition of “the deep and enduring ancestral and cultural connections that Tribes have to this landscape.”Deb Haaland’s first trip as interior secretary was to the two Utah monuments, where she met with various stakeholders, including tribal leaders who felt ignored and betrayed by the Trump administration’s sham review and rollback.In a report submitted to the White House in June and made public last week, Haaland advised Biden to restore both Utah monuments to their original footprints. The 16-page document details the administration’s consultation with 11 federally recognized tribes.“During Tribal consultation, all Tribal leaders and representatives who provided input expressed support for the restoration of the pre-modified boundaries and conditions of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments,” the report reads.“Some Tribal leaders characterized the Trump-Pence administration’s action to dramatically reduce the monument boundaries as yet another broken promise by the Federal Government, adding to the generational trauma that Tribes have endured from hundreds of years of policies and efforts to exterminate Native Americans and remove them from their lands.”When Biden signed proclamations on Friday reversing Trump’s rollbacks, elected tribal leaders stood behind him, including Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez, Ute Mountain Ute Chairman Manuel Heart, and Hopi Chairman Timothy Nuvangyaoma.“Today’s announcement, it’s not just about national monuments,” Haaland said at the signing ceremony. “It’s about this administration centering the voices of Indigenous people and affirming the shared stewardship of this landscape with tribal nations. The president’s action today writes a new chapter that embraces Indigenous knowledge, ensures tribal leadership has a seat at the table and demonstrates that by working together we can build a brighter future for all of us.”Biden’s proclamation on Bears Ears commits additional resources, including rangers and new informational signage, in order to better protect the area’s cultural and archeological resources and manage growing visitation.There are, of course, Native Americans who oppose the monuments for a variety of reasons. Rebecca Benally, a member of the Navajo Nation, has been one of Bears Ears’ fiercest opponents, going as far as to claim that “national monuments kill people.”Republicans, including Trump administration officials, have repeatedly pointed to Benally to argue that local Native Americans oppose the monument, and she was among several Navajo members present when Trump dismantled the monument.But individual tribal members don’t speak on behalf of tribes; that’s the job of elected tribal officials. And tribal support for Bears Ears has and continues to be overwhelming.The Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition represents the five tribes’ collective interests on Bears Ears in the same way that the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission acts on behalf of four Pacific Northwest tribes — Yakama, Warm Springs, Umatilla and Nez Perce — when it comes to fisheries issues in the Columbia River watershed.“When we have a consensus, we are acting on behalf of that tribe for this issue,” Gonzales-Rogers said. “It is inherently a direct, dotted line to each tribe specific to Bears Ears.”The bottom line, Gonzales-Rogers said, is Romney and other Utah politicians are using the anti-monument views of individual tribal members to misrepresent the positions of elected tribal governments.Gonzales-Rogers took issue with Romney accusing the Biden administration of having “squandered the opportunity to build consensus” with tribes and other stakeholders. The tribes were open to working with state officials and Utah’s congressional delegation, but they never provided the coalition with their vision and recommendations for Bears Ears, Gonzales-Rogers said. Instead, it became clear that they simply wanted tribes to follow their lead.“If anyone has squandered an opportunity it’s the Utah federal delegation and Governor [Spencer] Cox,” he said. “This premise that the tribes did not want to collaborate and be a partner is incredibly untrue.”“You’ve got to look at this historically,” he added. The state of Utah “has an acrimonious relationship with tribes. It has always questioned the sovereignty of tribes in its state.”Jade Begay, director of Indigenous-led organization NDN Collective’s climate justice campaign, called it a “classic example of divide and conquer.”“Utah elected officials like Senators Romney and Lee are trying to incite division between Indigenous Peoples, tribal leaders, and communities,” she told HuffPost via email. “Ultimately, these lawmakers’ statements are invalidated by their position within a party that promotes the violation of treaty and Indigenous rights.”Monday was Indigenous Peoples’ Day, which honors and celebrates Indigenous communities and their cultures. After invoking tribes in their ongoing fight against protected monuments, not a single member of Utah’s congressional delegation acknowledged the holiday.Lee, however, recognized Taiwan’s national holiday on Twitter Sunday. And on Tuesday, Lee and Reps. John Curtis (R-Utah) and Burgess Owens (R-Utah) publicly celebrated National Farmers Day."}, {"title": "2-Headed Baby Turtle Thrives At Massachusetts Animal Refuge", "text": "BARNSTABLE, Mass.

It was the state’s worst oil spill since 2015 and prompted renewed calls to oppose offshore drilling in the region.“The oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach is an environmental disaster with far-reaching consequences for our fish and wildlife, for our communities, and for our economy,” Bonta said in a statement Monday. “My office is committed to devoting the people and the resources necessary to ensure this environmental disaster is fully investigated, and we will follow the facts wherever they lead us.”The Los Angeles Times notes it’s unclear if Bonta’s office will pursue civil or criminal enforcement after the spill. The U.S. Coast Guard and Orange County district attorney’s office are conducting criminal investigations into the matter. The speaker of the California Assembly has also formed a Select Committee to “focus on the causes and potential lapses that led to the spill, as well as the spill’s impact on the environment.”Investigators said they suspect a ship’s anchor damaged the pipeline, which is owned by the Texas-based Amplify Energy, dragging it across the ocean floor. The Coast Guard added Friday that the strike may have happened months ago, growing worse over time. They also said the spill may have been caused by multiple strikes.Authorities have said they plan to investigate how Amplify took care of the aging pipeline, and if the company should have responded quicker to the leak. The Orange County district attorney also called for all pipelines off the county’s coast to be inspected in the coming months to ensure there are no further disasters.The spill has prompted local lawmakers to renew calls the state abandon offshore drilling and refocus on clean energy sources. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said last week fossil fuel drilling “is part of our past, vowing to oppose any new drilling in federal waters along the California coastline.Clean-up crews have collected thousands of gallons of oil from the water over the past week and spent days cleaning up local beaches impacted by the spill. Officials said Huntington Beach would reopen Monday after water quality tests revealed no detectable levels of toxins in the water, although they urged visitors to avoid areas that smell like oil."}, {"title": "Southern California Beach To Reopen After Undersea Pipeline Leaked Crude Into Ocean", "text": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) — A Southern California beach that had been closed since an undersea pipeline leaked crude into ocean waters last week is set to reopen Monday, officials announced Sunday night.City and state beaches in Huntington Beach will reopen after water quality tests revealed no detectable levels of oil associated toxins in the ocean water, the city of Huntington Beach and California State Parks said in a news release. They are still urging visitors to avoid areas that smell of oil and not to touch any oiled materials that wash ashore.That news will likely please surfers and beach-goers like Richard Beach, who returned to the waves in Huntington Beach with his bodyboard — until lifeguards jet skis chased him out on Sunday. He trekked back across the beach, passing workers in hazmat suits tasked with clearing the sand of sticky, black blobs that washed ashore after the spill.“The water’s perfect,” said Beach, 69. “Clear all the way to the bottom.”Huntington Beach and nearby coastal communities have been reeling from last week’s spill that officials said sent at least about 25,000 gallons (95,000 liters) and no more than 132,000 gallons (500,000 liters) of oil into the ocean. It was caused by a leak about 5 miles (8 kilometers) off the coast in a pipeline owned by Houston-based Amplify Energy that shuttles crude from offshore oil platforms to the coast.The spill was confirmed on Oct. 2, a day after residents reported a petroleum smell in the area. The cause is under investigation and officials said they believe the pipeline was likely damaged by a ship’s anchor several months to a year before it ruptured. It remains unknown when the slender, 13-inch (33-centimeter) crack in the pipeline began leaking oil.On Sunday, there was no smell of oil and the sand looked largely clear by the Huntington Beach pier, where workers combed the sand for tar. But local officials worry about the environmental impact of the spill on wetlands, wildlife and the economy. With the ocean off limits in the community dubbed Surf City USA, relatively few people were at the beach and shops that cater to them have been hurting.Officials in the city of 200,000 people have been testing the water to ensure it’s safe for people to get back in and said they’ll continue the testing for at least two more weeks.Since the spill, residents have been allowed to walk on the sand in Huntington Beach but not on the shoreline or enter the water, and parking was blocked off for nearby state beaches. Popular surfing and swimming spots in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach have also been closed.In Huntington Beach, shops selling everything from bikinis and stars-and-stripes boogie boards to sand toys and fishing gear have been taking a hit. Marian Johnson, who owns “Let’s Go Fishing” on the pier, said sales have been halved since the spill.Mike Ali, who owns the nearby shop Zack’s, said since the water closure he had to shut three of his four locations and slash his workers’ hours. People are coming in for bike rentals and food to his one store that remains open, but without surf lessons, event catering and beach bonfires, business has tanked 90%, he said.“It could be a year to two years to get the tourism to come back,” Ali said, adding that a 1990 oil spill wound up diverting would-be visitors to beaches south and north of the city.Rich Toro, 70, still took his regular 25-mile (40 kilometers) bike ride down to Huntington Beach on Sunday. But he said he wouldn’t race to get back into the water in light of the spill and worries about the impact on wildlife. Since the incident, officials have reported 38 dead birds and nine dead fish, while 27 oiled birds have been recovered and are being treated.On Sunday morning, only a handful of people played beach volleyball in Huntington Beach while a few others did exercises or laid on the sand.But the water closures didn’t deter everyone. While fishing is barred along the shore of virtually all of Orange County, Michael Archouletta, 29, said he came down from East Los Angeles and saw no signs on the pier preventing him from dropping a line. A school of fish swam beneath the pier nearby.“If this was so dangerous, the fish would be dead,” Archouletta said."}, {"title": "Damage That Triggered California Oil Spill Likely Happened Months Ago: Coast Guard", "text": "The underwater pipeline that caused a major oil spill off the coast of Southern California was likely initially damaged by a ship’s anchor “several months” ago, before the leak began, said a Coast Guard official.The anchor of a large vessel may have recently struck the massive pipeline, shattering the concrete casing, but didn’t likely cause the crack that spewed tens of thousand of gallons of crude last weekend, Coast Guard Capt. Jason Neubauer, the chief of the office of investigation and analysis, said at a press conference Friday.“This event could be multiple incidents and strikes of the pipeline after that initial event that we’re pretty confident occurred several months to a year ago,” he said.Investigators made their determination based in part on marine growth on the pipeline spotted in an underwater survey.Officials have yet to identify ships that may have been involved in the damage.“We’re going to be looking at every vessel movement over that pipeline, and every close encroachment from the anchor just for the entire course of the year,” Neubauer said.At least 126,000 gallons of crude spilled into the waters off Orange County a week ago when boaters began reporting a sheen in the water, officials said.“I don’t expect it to be more. That’s the capacity of the entire pipeline,” said the CEO of Amplify Energy, the Houston company that owns the pipeline. He said the pipeline was suctioned out and dozens of nearby oil platforms operated by Amplify were shut down.California Gov.

Her father, Woodraw, was helping his daughter move from Washington to Ohio, where she was slated to start a new job, and they took a side trip to Yellowstone on the way.After they parked, Laiha was grabbing the leashes for the two Shih Tzus, Rusty and Chevy, when Rusty got away from her and ended up in the scalding water of a thermal hot spring.The National Park Service identified the spring as Maiden’s Grave Spring, where the water temperature is 200 degrees Fahrenheit.Laiha jumped into the water to rescue the dog, and her father subsequently reached in to pull his daughter from the water. Laiha was flown to an Idaho hospital. Rusty was taken to a veterinarian but died from his injuries.Laiha’s sister, Kamilla, has been providing updates on her condition on a fundraising page for the family that a GoFundMe rep verified to YakTriNews. Kamilla wrote on Wednesday that Laiha, who had been put into a medically induced coma, was “stable” and “healing slowly.” Doctors originally thought her burns, which covered around 90% of her body, were half second-degree and half third-degree, but a closer examination revealed they were largely second-degree.“This means that our dad pulled her out insanely fast,” Kamilla wrote. “She’s incredibly lucky.

Since moving there in 2005, just weeks after Katrina, he had weathered Gustav, Ike, Isaac and Zeta, as well as countless smaller squalls. He had seen the water rush in from the sea, heard oak limbs crack under pummeling winds. He trusted his aluminum motorhome to stay on its wheels, as it always had. After all, they were only predicting a Category 2 storm. “We take those just fine,” he figured.Even if he wanted to leave, how would he get off the island? His pickup only drove in first gear and reverse. And he couldn’t abandon Whip, the old chestnut horse he looked after for his elderly landlord. All day Friday and Saturday, Walker watched his neighbors’ cars, laden with precious belongings, snake their way off the island. Soon, he was one of just about 100 of the island’s 1,500 full-time residents left behind.Then Ida gathered strength as it barreled across the warm waters of the Gulf. By Friday evening, meteorologists were predicting it would make landfall as a Category 4, with a much higher storm surge. Walker had been expecting 1 or 2 feet of water, maybe up to the bottom of his motorhome.“But whenever they changed it to 6, 7 feet, that changed the scenario to now, it’s coming up above my stove,” he said. “You can’t prepare for that. Now it’s too damn late for you to leave.”Others left on Grand Isle were starting to sense that there was nothing to do but let fate run its course. When the storm rolled in on Sunday morning, Rick Smith laid down on his bed. For 12 hours, he didn’t break eye contact with the framed portrait of Jesus Christ that hung on the opposite wall. Anita Wells gave her 14-year-old daughter a picture of her father, who passed away when the girl was young, and told her to stay put in the bedroom closet.But as the storm began lashing the island, Walker realized this one was different, and he wasn’t safe.He called his friend Lee Townsend, a cement contractor who specializes in raising houses onto 16-foot concrete pilings. Lee lived with his wife Sandra in a house known in the neighborhood as the “airport hangar” for its imposing metal siding. If any house on Grand Isle was going to be “hurricane proof,” Walker thought, it would be theirs.Townsend told Walker that they had plenty of fuel for the generator, and he should head over before it was too late. So Walker scooped up his beloved Yorkie, Scrappy-Doo, hopped in his truck, and headed out into the pounding rain and wind.Grand Isle formed over thousands of years as massive sediment deposits from the Mississippi River accumulated into “lobes,” or fingers of land jutting into the Gulf of Mexico. The course of the river gradually vacillates back and forth over time, and erosion and tides wore away at the long, narrow land. Abandoned lobes became islands that run parallel to the mainland, forming “barriers” between the open gulf and the coast’s habitat-rich bays.For millennia, these islands formed, washed away and were remade along the roughly 7,000 square miles of the delta. More recently, however, man-made levees have impeded the river’s natural fluctuations, preventing new sediment deposits.At the same time, Louisiana’s barrier islands are experiencing some of the fastest relative sea-level rise in the world ― nearly three times the global average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Over the past 100 years, the sea has already risen about 3 feet around Grand Isle, and that rate is expected to increase in the coming decades as planetary warming threatens to submerge the islands completely.The disappearance of barrier islands is a great concern for scientists, politicians and anyone else who understands the vital role barrier islands play in protecting coastal communities.“They’re sometimes described as speed bumps,” said Torbjörn Törnqvist, a geology professor at Tulane University’s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. “They act as a barrier if you have this big storm surge coming in, as we saw with Hurricane Ida.”Without the barrier islands and the coastal marshes they protect, explained Törnqvist, the impact of hurricanes on the mainland, including New Orleans, will be much worse.Of course, for residents of Grand Isle, serving as a hurricane “speed bump” has obvious drawbacks. Exposed to the open waters of the Gulf, the island receives the full brunt of every storm. Wind, rain and the devastating surges have written the island’s history, in many crucial ways.In 1860, some 90 years before storms were given names, a hurricane with a 6-foot storm surge washed away everything humans had built there. They rebuilt, only to suffer total destruction again during the Great Hurricane of 1893. It happened again in 1909 and 1915. The semi-regular onslaught continued into the 20th and 21st centuries, although improved building techniques and materials, and the practice of raising structures on pilings, have spared the community from total devastation in more recent times.That is, until Ida.Grand Isle Chief of Police Scooter Resweber was getting ready to ride out the storm in his second-story corner office in a large concrete building called the Multiplex. The Multiplex houses the police station, city council chambers and local court. Every part of it, down to the large reinforced glass windows, was built to withstand 200 miles per hour wind.At 72, Resweber remembers plenty of bad storms. But as Ida grew in ferocity, he became nervous.“We don’t know what’s gonna happen,” he told the nine police officers piled into his office for safety on Sunday afternoon. They all watched the mounting chaos outside through the big storm-proof windows. One of the raised houses across the street began to disintegrate in the wind.“We just saw it go to pieces,” Resweber said. “And then we looked that way, you can see a roof flying off, and then trailers rolling over … then all the sudden we start feeling the building shake.”A producer at the Weather Channel called Resweber as the hurricane began to arrive in earnest. The chief described the bedlam he was witnessing outside his window, and then asked her a question: “How long before the eye gets here, how much more we got to go?”“About three hours,” the producer replied.“We can’t take any more,” he told her.Then his phone went dead.In the hour and a half since Walker had arrived at Lee Townsend’s house that afternoon, the wind had picked up so much the whole place was swaying back and forth on its pilings.“It’s like being on a boat, only you’re on land,” said Walker. “This bad boy was in motion.”The refrigerator migrated five or so feet across the kitchen floor. Items were tumbling out of the cabinets and crashing to the ground. The group was scared, but indecisive about what to do next. Then, Walker noticed the water. It had come over the back levee and was steadily rising up the pilings below the house.“We got to go,” Walker called to Townsend. “We cannot stay here any longer.”There was no argument. The couple gathered a few belongings, and Walker once again bundled Scrappy-Doo into his arms. They ran out into the storm, crammed into Walker’s truck, and started off toward the Multiplex. It was just a few blocks away, but it took them about 15 minutes; the truck didn’t have windshield wipers — not that they would have helped anyway. The rain was blowing horizontally, and tree limbs, metal siding, and pieces of roof skidded across the road. Clumps of mud and grass the size of televisions smashed into the truck as it crept forward.When they finally arrived, the three leapt out of the truck, ran upstairs and began pounding on the police station’s glass door. A few other residents had showed up too, figuring it was the safest place on the island.Resweber brought them chairs, set them up in the hallway near the water fountain and bathroom, and told them they were welcome to take shelter there. But no more than two hours later, Walker felt an enormous suction of wind and heard the screech of ripping metal overhead.He looked up to see the corrugated steel roof tearing off the building ― nearly 30 sheets of metal roofing lifted from the Multiplex in quick succession and blew away. Fiberglass insulation and rain began to swirl through the hallway. Walker, the Townsends and others who’d sought shelter in the Multiplex quickly funneled into the stairwell, clinging to the railing. Water was pouring in from the cavity above, but outside the double doors, 150-mile-per-hour wind was hammering the building.With nowhere else to go, they huddled on the landing of the stairs. By the light of the glowing red “Exit” sign above them, they watched the concrete walls of the building flex and shudder, listening to the roar of the hurricane outside. Hour after grueling hour passed, until the noise began to abate. Finally, when the sunrise cast slivers of coruscating light beneath the doors, they knew they had made it through. They’d spent nearly 12 hours on the landing.Outside, Grand Isle was barely recognizable. Downed power lines and telephone poles crisscrossed the main road in enormous tangles, and entire buildings were gone. Huge lakes of seawater stretched the width of the island.Walker waded back to his property through water that reached his chest in places. He found his motorhome sitting in nearly three feet of water. Whip stood on some higher ground near the shed, soaking but okay.Meanwhile, the chief returned to a house with no roof. He gathered some belongings and returned to the Multiplex, where he set up a bed in his office. For those who stayed behind, the enormity of the destruction was becoming clear: This was the worst hurricane anyone could remember.Grand Isle wasn’t always the only inhabited barrier island on Louisiana’s coast. Nearby communities like Isle Derniere and Cheniere Caminada were once flourishing tourism and fishing hubs. But in 1856, a hurricane leveled Isle Derniere. A few decades later, the Great Hurricane struck Cheniere Caminada, killing 2,000 people. Neither community ever recovered.But where other islands suffered fatal blows, Grand Isle has always rebuilt. The island’s resilience is a source of pride for its inhabitants. “As long as there’s one grain of sand in Grand Isle, we’re gonna plant the American flag, and we’re gonna stay strong,” Mayor David Camardelle often says.It’s easy to see why residents want to stay. In calm weather, the gulf gently laps the wide beach as pelicans and migratory songbirds wheel on the breeze. The brightly painted houses have cheeky names like “Life’s a Beach” and “Law and Disorder.” Islanders can drive a golf cart to the nearby docks and cast a net for the evening’s shrimp boil. “It’s paradise,” Camardelle told HuffPost in September. “Why let it go in our lifetime?”Every few years, however, the idyllic island life is shattered, and residents once again find themselves rebuilding. In these moments, locals remind each other to remain “Grand Isle Strong,” a sort of unofficial motto the island has adopted to describe its fortitude. The hurricanes, Resweber says, are “the price of living in paradise.”This cycle of destruction and rebirth has long fortified the community. As weaker structures are blown or washed away, new, more robust ones rise in their place. Better building codes, levees, barriers and breakwaters have evolved to offer some improved protection.Now the inhabitants of Grand Isle are once again confronting the limitations of their defenses. The island’s most recent barrier is a 7.7 mile-long levee known locally as the “burrito” due to the synthetic tube containing some 760,000 cubic yards of sand and clay that runs through its core. The U.S Army Corp of Engineers installed this much needed update to the 27-year-old original levee in 2010. Still, nearly every storm since has damaged the burrito. Ida burst it entirely.Camardelle, who was first elected in 1997, is about as true-to-the-marrow a Grand Islander as you’ll find. His family members have been islanders for generations, forging their living from shrimp, crabs, and other bounty of the sea. The mayor was a shrimper before he became a city councilman in 1989. He still owns a shrimping boat.Like everyone else on the island, Camardelle has strong ideas about what Grand Isle should do next. For him, the answer is rocks. He wants rocks everywhere, rising from the sea in a great ring around the island, like an inverted moat. He’s been pushing this idea for decades, but is optimistic that now he might finally be heard.A recent face-to-face meeting with President Joe Biden was especially heartening.“We need rocks,” Camardelle told the president. “He said, ‘All over Delaware, along the coast where I was raised, we have rocks.’ ... He’s a rock man, just like all of southern Louisiana, every mayor, every parish president all along the coast, anywhere there’s water. Rocks work.”Rocks do work in one regard: They trap sand on the island, resulting in wider, more stable beaches. The wider beaches help dissipate wave energy, softening the impact of storm surges on the burrito levee, explained Rudy Simoneaux, chief engineer at the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA). But Simoneaux is skeptical that a rock wall, in itself, would do much to prevent storm surges during major hurricanes.Jason Binet, a civil engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who has worked extensively on Grand Isle, agrees.“The breakwaters will not do anything to offset when the actual storm comes through,” he said. “But the breakwaters are there to protect the beach so that you can have a nice broad beach system in place.”But the mayor may end up getting his rocks anyway. In the wake of Ida, CPRA and Army Corps of Engineers have been mapping out the island’s recovery. Among the proposed ideas is an expansion of existing beach nourishment projects, which would likely require the installation of up to 32 new rock breakwaters spanning the length of the island. But funding for that project has yet to be secured.Camardelle hopes the federal government will listen to what the locals have to say on the matter.“We’re the frontline, and nobody’s paying attention to us,” he said. “Every engineer has a different opinion. But we Cajun people; we live here.”While Camardelle often feels overlooked, he also knows that the island holds a grim bargaining chip. As the largest of the barrier islands protecting Barataria Bay, Grand Isle plays a crucial role in softening the impact of storm surges that reach the coast.“If this island goes away, New Orleans get ready,” he said. “You gonna have this surge.”Louisiana has been debating what to do since Katrina. In 2005, the state formed the CPRA to coordinate efforts, and in 2017 released an ambitious, multi-decade roadmap that includes restoring two dozen barrier islands, as well as redesigning the Mississippi River’s levee system to allow sediment to return to the coastal wetlands.Since 2007, the CPRA has secured $21.4 billion in funding, nearly half of the $50 billion it will require to complete the plan in the next 50 years. It has initiated 120 projects across Louisiana’s coast, including the construction of some 60 miles of new barrier islands and berms. The CPRA allocates funding to projects on a priority basis, and those priorities shift based on changing conditions in the region. Simoneaux says that Hurricane Ida has renewed focus on Grand Isle.But it’s a race against the rising seas. “The future is not looking good,” said Törnqvist. “I mean, there is no long-term future for a place like Grand Isle. That’s unfortunately the truth.”It’s not just Grand Isle’s land that is disappearing. The island saw a nearly 16% decline in population between 2000 and 2010. Most of the island’s residents attribute that decline to Katrina in 2005, and newly adopted construction codes that made the cost of rebuilding prohibitively expensive for many residents. Although mandated building techniques like continuous-load path construction, hurricane straps, and break-away walls resulted in far more resilient structures, they were financially unrealistic for many.Since 2010, the population has risen slightly, from 1,296 to 1,438, sometimes spiking to 9,000 in the summer with the arrival of the part-time residents. But Jerica and Devin Cheramie, who own the Grand Isle Supermarket, worry Ida will cause a far greater exodus than past storms.“Now it’s even more expensive to rebuild here,” said Jerica Cheramie, 28, as she patiently rang up a line of 20 national guardsmen. “I really feel like a lot of locals that lost everything probably is not coming back.”Insurance premiums on the island have also skyrocketed. A few years ago when the Cheramies were considering moving into a larger house on the island, they got a few insurance quotes for prospective properties. One company wanted $12,000 a year for just flood insurance ― not including wind or fire. Another was asking $17,000 for all three. In the end, they decided to stay in their “little bitty house,” where they pay $6,000.There’s also no guarantee that insurance companies will continue to cover Grand Isle at all.“Grand Isle has always been quite a challenge,” said James Donelon, Louisiana’s insurance commissioner. Donelon believes the only way to prevent insurance companies from fleeing high-risk areas like Grand Isle is to build more resilient structures. Those who can’t afford to do that may be out of luck. “For weaker properties,” Donelon admits, “I don’t have a solution.”AIR Worldwide, an extreme event modeling firm that provides data to insurers, has predicted that insurance companies lost between $20 and $30 billion dollars as a result of Ida. Homeowners in high-risk communities like Grand Isle will almost certainly see those losses passed along as higher premiums, fewer options, and reduced coverage availability.Even the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which FEMA administers to provide government-subsidized insurance policies for people in flood-prone areas, is becoming increasingly unaffordable. Congress created the NFIP in 1968 in response to the widespread flooding seen during Hurricane Betsy. The program was intended to fund itself through premiums, but since Katrina the NFIP has been operating at a loss, borrowing from the U.S. Treasury to cover claims. In 2017, Congress cancelled $16 billion of the NFIP’s debt in order to make payouts possible for victims of Hurricane Harvey.On Oct. 1, the agency implemented a new risk assessment methodology known as Risk Rating 2.0 that, according to the agency’s own assessment, will see premiums spike for nearly 80% of policyholders. The NFIP — which still owes the Treasury over $20 billion, even after the bailout, due to more-frequent flooding events — conceived the update in 2019 as a way to make the program more sustainable. But the move has already garnered detractors.Louisiana’s Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy wrote an open letter to FEMA on Sept. 22, requesting a delay in the new program. The senators claimed that nearly 20% of policyholders will drop out of the program in the next 10 years because of unaffordable premiums, and that “the NFIP may face long lasting reputational damage that will hurt the integrity and long-term solvency of the program.”A bill House Democrats proposed in September contains a provision that would wipe away the NFIP’s debt entirely. But according to a recent study by the First Street Foundation, the NFIP would need to increase premiums by over 400% to avoid requiring future bailouts. Such a rate increase would inevitably cause outrage amongst homeowners.In Grand Isle, FEMA’s reputation is already less than stellar. For uninsured or underinsured islanders, FEMA relief efforts like the Critical Needs Assistance program, which offers a one-time $500 payment, and the Individuals and Households program, which offers up to $33,000 for things like house repairs and personal property replacement, fall spectacularly short. In the past, the average payouts under these programs have been well below $10,000, a fraction of what it will cost to repair many of Grand Isle’s homes.Keith Markley, a disaster survivor assistance specialist for FEMA, said the programs are not intended to return recipients to financial solvency, only to cover short-term housing needs.“FEMA is not necessarily going to get you back to where you were before the storm,” he said. “FEMA strives to get you in a safe and secure environment, whether that’s at a hotel, a shelter, or the repair of your home to make it livable again.”But many Grand Isle residents have lost faith in FEMA.“I really don’t feel like they can handle this huge of a disaster,” said Kathy Anne Curtis, who had to move in with a friend after the home she rented was destroyed by Ida. Curtis has applied for aid but is doubtful she will receive a payout large enough to make an impact in her life. “That’s why a lot of people down here are used to handling things for themselves,” she said. “I don’t believe FEMA. I’m really not holding my breath on FEMA.”Markley pointed to other relief programs, like low-interest disaster loans from the Small Business Administration, as more viable options for island residents who require more substantial funds to rebuild. But with the future still so uncertain, many islanders are hesitant to take on debt ― especially to repair structures that they can no longer afford to insure.Walker fears that low-income residents like him and many of his friends will be priced out of Grand Isle, while the wealthier, part-time islanders with vacation cabins will stay.He and Scrappy-Doo are planning to move to Missouri as soon as they can afford to.As residents weigh their options, the day-to-day business of rebuilding continues. National Guard troops from Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, along with active duty troops from the 46th Engineer Battalion, arrived on Sept. 5 to begin repairs. They cut through some 2 feet of sand that had caked the surface of Highway 1, piling it in huge berms on the side of the road.Bulldozers cleared the downed telephone poles, sheets of siding, splintered lumber, sodden furniture and piles of garbage. Electrical workers arrived to begin the daunting work of restoring power to the island. Residents of nearby parishes came in to cook lunch for all the workers.“The community has really taken care of us for food,” said Captain Cristina Polomino, the commanding officer of the 46th Engineer company. “The locals cook jambalaya for us for lunch.”The Cheramies evacuated to the family hunting cabin in Mississippi for the storm, and returned to find their grocery store inundated with half a foot of mud. They got to work cleaning, fired up the generators and reopened just two days later.The grocery store has become something of an ad-hoc headquarters for the cleanup effort. On a Thursday afternoon 11 days after the storm, both Walker and Camardelle were perusing the aisles, while National Guardsmen coming off their work shifts were buying fishing poles and bait. There was a pervasive spirit of camaraderie: At one point a local resident announced that he would cover the entire tab of the 20 or so guardsmen waiting to check out as a gesture of gratitude.In one aisle, Anita Wells, 35, was crouched near the rows of laundry detergent, wiping mud off the bottles one by one. She usually washes dishes at the nearby Starfish restaurant, but has picked up a few shifts at the grocery store to help the Cheramies get back on their feet.The storm mostly spared Wells’ house, but it scattered her family. With the Grand Isle school closed indefinitely, Wells sent her 14-year-old daughter, Jordan, to Baton Rouge for the school year. She’d been gone for nearly two weeks by then, the longest they have ever been apart.Jordan returned for a one-night visit a few days later. She sprinted across the muddy parking lot cluttered with military vehicles and water tankers, and fell into her mother’s arms. They held each other and cried.“It was really rough on me,” said Jordan, wiping away tears. “Too far away from my mom. I’ve been with her like my whole life. And it breaks my heart, it really does.”Jordan finds Baton Rouge to be chaotic and overwhelming. She has always lived in the country. The teenager dreams about relocating with her mother to Hawaii, or perhaps Florida.“Florida gets hit with more hurricanes than we do,” Wells joked.Wells plans to stay in Grand Isle until next summer, save up some money, and then leave, too. Displacement from the island feels inevitable, the result of forces far beyond anyone’s control.“You’ll lose more and more land every hurricane season,” said Wells. “Before it’s over, the island will be down into the ocean.”Drone footage credit: Win McNamee/Getty Images"}, {"title": "Google To Cut Off Ad Money For YouTube Videos That Spread Climate Change Denial", "text": "Google said Thursday it would cut off ad money for YouTube videos and other content on its sites that include climate change denial, a major step for the tech company as scientists continue to warn that humanity is edging ever closer to unprecedented levels of planetary warming.“In recent years, we’ve heard directly from a growing number of our advertising and publisher partners who have expressed concerns about ads that run alongside or promote inaccurate claims about climate change,” Google’s ads team wrote in a statement. “Advertisers simply don’t want their ads to appear next to this content.

Their plan for tribal nations, released exactly one year ago today, included a commitment to “take immediate steps to reverse the Trump administration’s assaults on America’s natural treasures,” including orders that drastically shrunk the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments.Five tribes — the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni and the Ute Indian Tribe — consider the Bears Ears landscape sacred. It is home to more than 100,000 known cultural and archaeological sites, including ancient rock art panels and cliff dwellings.“The protection of public lands must not become a pendulum that swings back and forth depending on who is in public office,” Biden said at a signing ceremony Friday afternoon outside the White House. “It’s not a partisan issue.”Biden emphasized that his actions are part of a broader administrative effort to safeguard vital ecosystems and combat global climate change.“These protections provide a bridge to our past, but they also build a bridge to a safer, more sustainable future — one where we strengthen our economy and pass on a healthy planet to our children and our grandchildren,” he said.In 2017, Trump carved more than 2 million acres from the Utah sites — the largest rollback of federal land protections in U.S. history — and opened the door for oil, gas and mineral development. The boundary of Bears Ears, a 1.35 million-acre landscape named after a pair of twin buttes, was shrunk by 85%. The nearby 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante ― the largest land national monument in the country, rich in both archeological and paleontological resources ― was cut roughly in half.Biden’s orders restore both Utah monuments to their original footprint while retaining approximately 11,000 acres that Trump added to Bears Ears in 2017. They also reinstated prohibitions on commercial fishing within Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a 4,900-square-mile protected site off the East Coast, that Trump lifted in 2020.Native American tribes and environmental groups had grown increasingly frustrated with Biden in recent weeks over what they saw as delayed action. In a Sept. 22 letter to the president, the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, made up of the five Native American tribes that petitioned the Obama administration to establish Bears Ears, called on Biden to take “immediate action” to restore the monument and expand its boundary.“The longer action is not taken, real harm, much permanent, is occurring on this sacred landscape,” wrote coalition co-chairs Clark Tenakhongva, vice chairman of the Hopi Tribe, and Henry Stevens Jr., a representative of the Navajo Nation.Dozens of progressive organizations sent their own letter Thursday in support of the coalition’s demands.“President Biden did the right thing restoring the Bears Ears National Monument,” Shaun Chapoose, a coalition member and chairman of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee, said in a statement. “For us, the Monument never went away. We will always return to these lands to manage and care for our sacred sites, waters, and medicines. The Monument represents a historic opportunity for the federal government to learn and incorporate our tribal land management practices that we developed over centuries and are needed more now than ever.”Utah Republicans, however, were quick to condemn Biden’s action. In a joint statement, the Utah congressional delegation called it “a devastating blow” to ongoing efforts to pinpoint a permanent, legislative solution.“Yet again, Utah’s national monuments are being used as a political football between administrations,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) wrote on Twitter.On his first day in office, Biden signed an executive order that directed the Interior Department to review Trump’s decision to gut the sites, and to recommend whether to undo the changes.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland submitted a report to the White House back in June, advising Biden to reexpand Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante as well as reinstate fishing restrictions in Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. It took Biden nearly four months to act on her recommendation.“I know there’s a lot of folks who are anxious,” Haaland told HuffPost on a call with reporters in late September. “I have every confidence that President Biden will do what he promises.”At Friday’s signing ceremony, Haaland fought back tears as she thanked Biden and recalled spending time in Bears Ears.“Bears Ears is a living landscape,” she said. “When I’ve been there, I’ve felt the warmth and joy of ancestors who’ve cared for this special place since time immemorial.”Haaland’s first trip as interior secretary was to the Utah monuments in April. There, she visited ancient petroglyphs and cliff dwellings and met with monument stakeholders, including tribal leaders who felt ignored and betrayed by the Trump administration’s sham review and subsequent rollbacks.“This is a place that must be protected in perpetuity for every American and every child of the world,” Haaland said. “Today’s announcement, it’s not just about national monuments. It’s about this administration centering the voices of Indigenous people and affirming the shared stewardship of this landscape with tribal nations.”“The historical connection between Indigenous peoples and Bears Ears is undeniable; our Native American ancestors sustained themselves on the landscape since time immemorial and evidence of their rich lives is everywhere one looks,” Haaland said in a statement ahead of Friday’s signing ceremony. “This living landscape must be protected so that all Americans have the profound opportunity to learn and cherish our history.”A member of the Pueblo of Laguna of New Mexico, Haaland made history in March when she became the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history and the first Native American to lead the 172-year-old Interior Department. Her confirmation was a historic moment for Indigenous communities across the country, and Haaland has made investing in Indian Country a top priority.In the nearly four years since Trump’s rollbacks, hundreds of thousands of acres, and the archeological and cultural sites found on them, have been at increased risk from ballooning visitation and potential extractive development. The Trump-era rollback carved an estimated ​​74% of the known cultural and archaeological sites out of the Bears Ears boundary, according to the local conservation group Friends of Cedar Mesa. One archeologist told HuffPost that stripping these sites of the protections that the monument designation afforded was a “worst-case scenario.”In its recent letter to Biden, the tribal coalition included photos of rock art — a pair of human handprints — in Bears Ears before and after vandals covered it in mud. Since December, at least eight new hardrock mining claims have been staked on lands that Trump removed from Bears Ears, according to the coalition.“Each day that passes without national monument protection for numerous sacred sites and irreplaceable cultural resources risks desecration, looting, vandalism, and misinformed visitation to an area that contains the exact kind of antiquities that inspired the creation of the Antiquities Act,” the coalition’s recent letter to Biden read. “These artifacts, considered by us to be messages our ancestors meant for us to see and incorporate as lessons into our present, are literally being erased.”Biden’s proclamation on Bears Ears commits additional resources, including rangers and new informational signage, in order to better protect the area’s resources and manage growing visitation.Trump and his team repeatedly insisted their monument rollbacks were meant solely to correct what they described as a “federal land grab,” rather than boosting energy and mineral development — claims that media reporting and internal documents contradicted.In a video post to Twitter, former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who spearheaded the Trump-era rollbacks, called Biden’s decision “a slap in the face of trying to work with states and communities.” When Zinke called on Trump to shrink Bears Ears in 2017, the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition condemned it as “a slap in the face to the members of our Tribes and an affront to Indian people all across the country.”While Trump’s changes to the Utah monuments garnered the most attention, those made to Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument were equally dramatic. The site, located about 130 miles off Cape Cod, is home to ancient seafloor canyons and seamounts, endangered whales, deep ocean corals and numerous migratory fish species. Greenlighting commercial fishing undermined the very purpose of the designation: to protect and restore fisheries and other ocean resources.“Protecting the New England marine monument is a win-win for both fishermen and healthy oceans, sustaining strong fisheries for years to come,” Gib Brogan, a senior campaign manager at ocean advocacy group Oceana, said in a statement. “By permanently prohibiting destructive fishing in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts and reinstating the protections, the hundreds of marine mammals that swim there will have reduced risk in the monument, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale.”"}, {"title": "The Best And Worst To-Go Coffee Cups For The Planet, Ranked", "text": "Many of us became experts at brewing coffee at home (and even making lattes and cappuccinos) during the pandemic. But if you were vaccinated earlier this year, a major perk may be the fact that you feel comfortable visiting your local coffee shop for your daily caffeine fix again. Hallelujah!But after a year or more of drinking out of a ceramic mug at home, you may suddenly be looking at that paper or plastic to-go cup and thinking, “How bad is this for the environment, exactly?”According to Isaac Emery, founder and principal consultant at Informed Sustainability Consulting, it’s not great.“Single-use items just aren’t sustainable,” Emery told HuffPost. “Sustainability can mean a lot of different things, but under no circumstances does it mean using something once and disposing of it. There will always be an environmental cost to that.”While we generally think of paper as recyclable, Emery said that the waxy lining that keeps disposable cups from falling apart when they’re full of liquid makes this challenging. Starbucks, for example, has spent years trying to figure out how to make its paper cups recyclable.“Paper cups are generally paper wrapped internally with a polymer (plastic) lining and therefore can’t be recycled and have to generally be sent to landfill,” said Mark Driscoll, sustainability expert and founder of the consultancy Tasting the Future. “However, those marked as ‘biodegradable or compostable’ cups typically use a poly (lactic acid) lining and can be composted.”Unfortunately, most of those still end up in landfills due to a lack of composting facilities or the costs associated with getting them composted. Plus, “to meet the demand for paperboard (paper used in cups), trees can be cut down from as far away as Russia and Brazil, and most are still not [made] from recycled paper,” Driscoll noted. “To ensure cups use paperboard from sustainable timber sources, seek out the FSC (forestry stewardship logo).”Many of the plastic cups used for iced beverages aren’t accepted by recycling programs, either. “Most are made from polypropylene that is not accepted in many curbside recycling programs,” Driscoll said.Feeling like you need to give up your coffee to-go habit altogether? Not so fast. Some to-go coffee methods are more environmentally friendly than others. Here, Driscoll and Emery rank all the to-go cup options:Ceramic mug at the coffee shop: AWhile we’re still in a bit of a weird space with the pandemic, if you feel comfortable actually sitting down at a coffee shop (maybe they have outdoor seating) and drinking out of one of their ceramic mugs, that’s the most sustainable way to drink coffee from a coffee shop, according to Emery. Because these can be washed in a dishwasher, they use less energy (and less soap) than something that has to be hand-washed, like a travel mug.Travel mug: BIf you bring your own travel cup (like the Copco mugs seen below), it’s a much better option than single-use cups, but it’s also not perfect. Emery says “there are environmental impacts through manufacturing materials like stainless steel, or worse, plastic to-go cups. A plastic travel cup is heavy, which means there’s a lot of plastic in it.”But if you use it often enough, a travel to-go mug can be a very environmentally friendly option. “If you’re using your travel mug 50, 100 or 200 times, the environmental cost goes way down,” Emery said.Paper to-go cup without a lid: CBy skipping the plastic lid, you’ll use less plastic (although your beverage will get cold faster). “This is upgraded to a B if [the cup] has a biodegradable, plant-based lining,” Driscoll noted.Paper to-go cup with a lid: DBecause a lid adds additional plastic, it’s worse for the environment than a paper cup without a lid.Plastic to-go cup: FUnfortunately, there are very few ways to win if you’re buying an iced coffee beverage that comes in a plastic cup. “The plastic cups used for iced drinks are problematic and often not accepted in recycling programs,” Driscoll said.And while paper straws are better than plastic straws (the less plastic we use, the better), Emery pointed out that once they’re covered in coffee, they’re not recyclable.Emery noted that if you want to reduce your carbon footprint even while choosing a to-go cup that might not be great for the environment, you can try to opt for a more sustainable coffee beverage.“Your actual drink has a bigger environmental impact than the coffee cup,” he said. “So if you want to offset some of the impact of your to-go cup, get a more environmentally friendly drink.”One way to do that is to choose plant-based milk over dairy milk because it has a smaller carbon footprint. Or better yet, take your coffee black. “Milk is the most harmful to the environment, followed by coffee, followed by the cup. If you want to choose the best beverage for the environment, order an Americano or black coffee,” Emery said.Now that you understand exactly how to make your to-go coffee drink more sustainable, you can go back to worrying about the havoc it’s wreaking on your bank account.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Otis, a 25-year-old bear who lives in the park, garnered more than 51,000 votes in the contest, overcoming the almost-but-not-quite-as-hefty 151 Walker.It’s Otis’ fourth win and comes before he reaches his peak fatness. The bear overcame a late start in this year’s feeding frenzy and was extremely thin when he was observed in July. Otis is also missing two of his canine teeth, and his others are “greatly worn,” his bio says.“Otis must also compete with younger and larger bears who want access to his fishing spots,” the biography reads. “While Otis occasionally appears to be napping or not paying attention, most of the time he’s focused on the water, and he experiences a relatively high salmon catch rate as a result.”As Katmai said Tuesday, to celebrate the crown, Otis was “still chowing down” like a true champion. Brown bears can gain up to 4 pounds a day, and Otis was estimated at 900 pounds in 2019, The New York Times notes.Fat Bear Week is an annual online tradition celebrating bears’ success as gluttonous glories in the months leading up to their winter hibernations. Bears gather along waterways in Alaska to feast on salmon from late June until mid-October to gain enough mass to survive a long, cold winter.“Each winter, curled snug in their dens, brown bears endure a months-long famine,” a website for the competition says. “During hibernation, bears will not eat or drink and can lose one-third of their body weight. Their winter survival depends on accumulating ample fat reserves before entering the den.”The transformations of Otis and Walker over the last months are astounding.For the bears at Katmai, fatness is a key indicator of good health not just among their populations but for the environment as a whole.“Fat bears exemplify the richness of Katmai National Park and Bristol Bay, Alaska, a wild region that is home to more brown bears than people and the largest, healthiest runs of sockeye salmon left on the planet,” the site says."}, {"title": "White House Moves To Scrap Trump-Era Rewrite Of Key Environmental Law", "text": "President Joe Biden’s White House moved Wednesday to reverse the Trump administration’s shortsighted, industry-friendly overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act, one of America’s bedrock environmental laws.NEPA is a 50-year-old law that protects air, water and land by requiring federal agencies to conduct detailed environmental assessments of major infrastructure projects. In 2020, the Trump administration changed how the federal government implements the law in order to fast-track energy projects and other development, limiting public input on such projects and allowing federal agencies to ignore climate change when reviewing them.The White House Council on Environmental Quality on Wednesday announced steps to restore provisions that had been in place for decades prior to the Trump-era overhaul, including requiring agencies to consider all environmental impacts of a proposed project and providing the flexibility to work with communities to consider alternatives that would minimize harm.“The basic community safeguards we are proposing to restore would help ensure that American infrastructure gets built right the first time, and delivers real benefits ― not harms ― to people who live nearby,” CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory said in a statement. “Patching these holes in the environmental review process will help reduce conflict and litigation and help clear up some of the uncertainty that the previous administration’s rule caused.”The Trump-era changes were the first major update to the law in more than four decades. While the Trump administration presented it as a long-overdue “modernization” necessary to speed up permitting, critics saw it as a clear attack on environmental justice that largely benefited polluting industries. The NEPA review process has long been a primary avenue for communities, often low-income and communities of color, to challenge pipelines, power plants, airports and highways that pose potential risks to the environment and public health.Biden’s White House said the rules proposed Wednesday are “Phase 1” of a broader effort to strengthen the environmental law.Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, applauded Wednesday’s announcement as “a welcome first step in placing public health needs and the lives of Americans ahead of the profits of corporate polluters.”“Today’s move begins the process of restoring environmental protections that stood for decades prior to the Trump administration,” he said in a statement. “Restoring these protections is a necessary first step toward even stronger NEPA protections that are needed to improve public input opportunities under NEPA and to better protect communities from polluted air and water, especially those communities that are already overburdened by the cumulative effects of multiple pollution sources.”"}, {"title": "Governor Says Offshore Drilling ‘Part Of Our Past’ After California Oil Spill", "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) vowed Tuesday to vehemently oppose any new drilling in federal waters off the state’s coastline following a large oil spill that fouled some of the nation’s most iconic beaches last weekend.The governor made the comments Tuesday alongside half a dozen state and local leaders following the oil spill, which occurred about five miles off the coast of Huntington Beach. Officials said Saturday that 126,000 to 144,000 gallons of crude had leaked from an aging pipeline along the seafloor, creating an oil slick that stretched for miles and threatened critical coastal habitats and popular beaches.It’s the state’s largest spill since 2015, an immediate reminder, Newsom said, that aging oil platforms needed to be phased out as the state transitioned to cleaner energy sources. Newsom declared a state of emergency in Southern California’s Orange County late Monday and said investigators would work quickly to determine how the spill happened.“It’s time once and for all to disabuse ourselves that this has to be part of our future. This is part of our past,” Newsom said from the sands of Bolsa Chica State Beach. “We can moralize and talk about the good old days, but at the end of the day, this isn’t about the stale air of normalcy but the fresh air of progress.”The owner of the pipeline, Amplify Energy, said it believed the spill may have been caused by a ship’s anchor, although the U.S. Coast Guard was still determining if that was the case. Amplify added Tuesday that divers found a 13-inch split in the structure and that a large portion of the pipe had been displaced, making it appear like the line had been pulled “like a bowstring.”Questions remain, however, about how quickly the spill was identified after the Coast Guard said it was first aware of reports of a spill on Friday night, hours before Amplify reported the incident to authorities.The spill has prompted renewed calls for the federal government to ban offshore drilling. The Los Angeles Times notes no new drilling leases have been approved near California since 1984, but former President Donald Trump attempted to open up the region for exploration in 2018. The stated passed new laws to block that, but officials including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D) have reintroduced a bill, called the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, that would permanently bar oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington.Newsom said banning new drilling wasn’t “complicated,” adding that the difficult part would be transitioning the state away from oil and gas operations that had been in place for decades. He said such work is essential to protect the “coast and other coasts of dreams for future generations.”“Those damn platforms. Fossil fuels. It’s not very complicated,” the governor said when talking about the cause of climate change. “So we need to grow up, grow out of this dependency, this mindset that we can’t do more. That we can’t do better.”Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) echoed other local leaders who met with Newsom on Tuesday, saying she would continue to support legislation banning offshore drilling in federal waters.“We are going to make sure that we have answers as to how this happened and that we make sure to hold the responsible party accountable,” she told reporters."}, {"title": "The Planet Lost 14% Of Coral Reefs In 10-Year Period, Startling Report Finds", "text": "The planet lost about 14% of its coral reefs between 2009 and 2018, a startling figure that reflects the dire threats to the iconic creatures as climate change continues to ravage sensitive ecosystems around the globe.A new report, released Monday by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, found mass coral bleaching events linked to warmer temperatures remained the greatest threat to sensitive reefs. The study is the largest analysis of global coral reef health ever done, and includes observations along reefs in more than 70 countries over the last 40 years.That 14% figure is staggering. Effectively, the loss amounts to about 4,500 square miles of reef, or more than all of the living coral off the coast of Australia, including the iconic Great Barrier Reef.“There are clearly unsettling trends toward coral loss, and we can expect these to continue as warming persists,” Paul Hardisty, the head of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said in a statement Monday. “A clear message from the study is that climate change is the biggest threat to the world’s reefs, and we must all do our part by urgently curbing global greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating local pressures.”In some good news, the report found that reefs still remain resilient even amid the ongoing assault by climate change. If immediate steps are taken to dramatically reduce carbon emissions and rein in climate change, they can recover. Also, global reef cover has increased in some years after mass bleachings.World leaders are preparing to meet later this month at the United Nations’ COP26 climate change summit, where they are expected to hash out emissions reduction targets for the end of this decade. A report released by the UN in August found the burning of fossil fuels had essentially locked in intensive climate change for the next 30 years, a statistic the body’s secretary-general called a “code red for humanity.”Aside from their beauty, coral reefs are iconic, essential structures that provide an outsized boon to the oceans and humans that live near them. Reefs cover just 0.2% of the ocean floor, but account for at least 25% of the ocean’s biodiversity. The report estimates reefs provide about $2.7 trillion in value per year, including some $36 billion in tourism.But reefs are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Warmer waters linked to the phenomenon can effectively cook the delicate corals during a process known as bleaching. When that happens, the once-colorful reefs turn bone white as the algae that feeds them leaves their skeletons. If temperatures stabilize, the corals can recover, but if the hot water lingers too long large stretch can die. Bleached reefs take years to recover, but frequent bleaching events can kill them off for good.The threat is notably pressing in Australia. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered a devastating series of mass coral bleaching events that have left large swaths of the emblematic structure dying or dead. UNESCO said in June the World Heritage Site should be listed as “in danger,” citing the ongoing threat of climate change, but the Australian government successfully lobbied to delay that decision, which would have been a significant blow to the country’s identity.The devastation hasn’t been confined to Australia. One mass coral bleaching event that impacted the entire globe in 1998 killed 8% of the planet’s corals, mainly in the Indian Ocean, Japan and the Caribbean. However, reefs had time to recover after that mass bleaching event and largely bounced back.Now, the oceanic heat waves are happening too often in some regions for reefs to heal. Along the Great Barrier Reef, mass bleaching events have struck three times in five years."}, {"title": "California Pipeline Pulled Like ‘Bowstring,’ Coast Guard Says, As Oil Cleanup Continues", "text": "Cleanup crews and environmental authorities are racing to contain the devastation linked to a large oil spill off the Southern California coastline as new concerns emerge over how the leak was handled in the critical hours after oil started spewing from a damaged pipeline.The U.S. Coast Guard said Tuesday that about 4,000 feet of the pipeline had been displaced on the ocean floor. Divers found a 13 inch split in the structure, although they didn’t identify a possible cause. No oil was seen oozing from the pipeline at the time of investigation, which noted the structure had been pulled “like a bowstring.”California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a state of emergency in Orange County late Monday, saying he was “moving to cut red tape and mobilize all available resources to protect public health and the environment.”“As California continues to lead the nation in phasing out fossil fuels and combating the climate crisis, this incident serves as a reminder of the enormous cost fossil fuels have on our communities and the environment,” the governor said in a statement.The leak was first reported on Saturday off the coast of Orange County’s Huntington Beach by Amplify Energy, a Houston company that owns the pipeline. About 126,000 gallons of crude oil is estimated to have spilled from the 17-mile-long structure, which carries fuel from offshore platforms to land from about five miles off Newport Beach. That amount would fill about one-fifth of an Olympic-size swimming pool but is enough to leave a slick about 13 miles long.It’s California’s largest oil leak since 2015 and has raised concerns for critical wetlands and coastal habitats. Authorities have reported some wildlife deaths, with oil-coated fish and birds washing ashore, although wildlife groups have said the effects on wildlife so far were “much better than we had feared.”California’s Department of Fish and Wildlife closed a swath of fisheries along the coastline due to the oil spill, saying the pollution was a threat to public health. The closure covers the area from Huntington Beach southeast to Dana Point, the agency said.Beaches in the region have been closed.Martyn Willsher, chief executive of Amplify, said Monday that the company had likely found the source of the leak, suggesting to reporters a ship anchor may have hit the pipeline. The Coast Guard is still assessing if that may be the cause, and the agency is helping with cleanup efforts, using skimmers to contain the spill.“There is no active leak that we’re aware of,” Willsher said at a news conference. “We are deeply concerned about what we’re seeing environmentally. Whatever needs to be done, we will take care of it.”The New York Times reports, however, that some experts have expressed confusion about why Amplify wasn’t able to determine its pipeline was leaking more quickly. The publication added that pressure sensors should have gone off when the leak began, and Reuters notes residents reported a sheen and a foul smell beginning Friday (Willsher said the company hadn’t received such reports and notified officials “immediately” after company employees noticed an oil sheen early Saturday morning).“We — the boat — noticed the sheen, immediately contacted the platforms, and the platforms instantaneously started the incident plan,” Willsher said during the news conference. “We instantly, you know, started notifying all the relevant agencies and getting the incident plan in place. It was within that 30 minutes-or-so timeframe.”The Los Angeles Times added later Monday that state and federal officials had indications that oil was leaking into the sea on Friday evening, about 10 hours before Amplify reported the spill to authorities. The newspaper obtained documents showing the Office of Spill Prevention and Response, a division of the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, was told of an “observed sheen” in the waters off Huntington Beach shortly after 10 p.m. Friday.The Coast Guard added Tuesday that it was aware of the reports on Friday night, although determinations about the spill were “inconclusive” until early the next day. Officials said the agency often receives such alerts and had followed standard procedure before “a full-scale mobilization began.”The incident is likely to prompt questions about the 40-year-old pipeline and how it was maintained and repaired, the Times said. The Orange County Register reports the incident could result in tens of millions of dollars in fines."}, {"title": "Caesars Palace To Host 3-Day Climate Denier Conference", "text": "Caesars Entertainment, one of the world’s largest casino-resort operators, is set to host the Super Bowl of climate change denial this month at its iconic Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.On Oct. 15, the Illinois-based Heartland Institute is scheduled to convene its three-day “International Conference on Climate Change,” an annual confab at which the right-wing think tank that cut its teeth shilling for the tobacco industry in the 1990s parades its stable of pundits and contrarians who reject climate science.This year’s event, dubbed “The Great Reset: Climate Realism Vs. Climate Socialism,” will dive headfirst into the conspiracy that world governments are simply using climate change to control people’s lives.“The global climate agenda, as promoted by the United Nations, is to overhaul the entire global economy, usher in socialism, and forever transform society as one in which individual liberty and economic freedom are crushed,” reads a description of the event.The list of keynote speakers is a who’s who of the denial movement, including William Happer, the retired Princeton University physics professor who served as an adviser to President Donald Trump and has declared Earth is in the midst of a “CO2 famine”; Myron Ebell, director of the right-wing Competitive Enterprise Institute who led the Trump EPA transition team and was a key figure in Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris climate agreement; and Steve Milloy, a former cigarette and coal lobbyist who also served on the Trump EPA transition team.Like most casinos, Caesars Entertainment hosts all kinds of events. The company itself donates to candidates across the ideological spectrum, but, since 2012, has generally contributed more to Democratic campaigns each election cycle. But the Heartland event runs counter to the $25 billion casino giant’s own corporate pledges on climate change, which includes “using the methodology prescribed by” United Nations scientists to design plans to eliminate planet-heating emissions throughout its supply chain.The company’s website features an entire page on climate change and its “commitment to science-based goals.” On it, the company touts its “climate leadership” and says it is “committed to developing science-based” climate targets and “dedicated to collaborating with other organizations to advance industry-wide and overall corporate climate leadership.”The firm, which owns Caesars Palace and dozens of other casino resorts, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Monday. But less than two months ago, the company pulled the plug on a conference it was set to host in Las Vegas on behalf of a group that espouses the fringe conspiracy known as QAnon.The Heartland Institute’s conference was initially christened the “Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change,” or NIPCC. The name was an unsubtle attempt at branding Heartland’s modest gathering of fringe scientists and political cranks as a legitimate alternative to the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the premiere global climate science body made up of top researchers from more than 100 countries.Heartland’s hard-line climate denial may have filled its coffers throughout the early 2000s as oil and coal companies pumped money into its campaigns to harass scientists and confuse the public over what accumulated carbon does to the atmosphere. But by the early 2010s, even Exxon Mobil Corp., one of the fiercest opponents of climate science, stopped giving Heartland money.Far-right megadonors stepped in to fill the void. Hedge fund billionaires Robert and Rebekah Mercer began giving the nonprofit millions. The donations helped prop up the institution, giving Heartland newfound influence in Washington when former President Donald Trump, a fellow recipient of Mercer money, took office and began a damaging but quixotic quest to blind the federal government to the long-understood realities of fossil-fuel-induced warming.Still, it didn’t take long for the group to wither under fresh scrutiny. In 2017, while goading the new Environmental Protection Agency leadership to host a public debate over climate science, Heartland proposed as one of its debaters a convicted child sex offender. Within months, HuffPost revealed that one of Heartland’s top officials had defended the nonprofit’s former marketing chief against charges that he stalked and harassed a young female employee.In 2019, the once-ascendant think tank retreated back into its ideological fortress, denying HuffPost and other major news outlets press credentials to cover that year’s conference, held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. “HuffPost won’t be getting any credentials for this conference,” Heartland’s Jim Lakely wrote at the time. “You can watch the live-stream if you want to cover it.”By 2020, Heartland’s brand of outright climate denial had begun to lose sway as mounting disasters made tangible what scientists had warned for decades would come of unchecked emissions. It attempted to win back relevance by plucking from obscurity a German teenager who, with her blond hair and serious tone, superficially offered deniers their own version of Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen whose climate protests inspired a global movement.But Naomi Seibt, the so-called anti-Greta, quickly drew more negative attention once the teen’s links to neo-Nazis and white nationalist agitators surfaced. Seibt is also slated to speak at Heartland’s conference in Las Vegas.By the end of winter 2020, Heartland laid off at least 10 staffers amid worsening financial woes.“Heartland is broke,” one long-time staffer said in a text message HuffPost obtained at the time.Tickets for Heartland’s event at Caesars Palace go for $250 per head."}, {"title": "Major Southern California Oil Spill Fouls Beaches, Kills Wildlife", "text": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) — One of the largest oil spills in recent Southern California history fouled popular beaches that could end up closed for months as crews scrambled Sunday to contain the crude before it spread further into protected wetlands.Divers were trying to determine where and why the leak occurred, but the flow of oil was stopped late Saturday from the pipeline that runs under the ocean off Huntington Beach, according to the head of the company that operates the line.At least 126,000 gallons (572,807 liters) of crude spilled into the waters off Orange County starting late Friday or early Saturday when boaters began reporting a sheen in the water, officials said.“I don’t expect it to be more. That’s the capacity of the entire pipeline,” said Amplify Energy CEO Martyn Willsher. He said the pipeline was suctioned out and dozens of nearby oil platforms operated by Amplify were shut down.It was one of the largest oil spills in recent Southern California history, fouling the strand in Huntington Beach, the town known as Surf City USA. Crews scrambled to contain the crude before it spread further into protected wetlands.Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said the city’s famous beaches could remain closed for weeks or even months.“In a year that has been filled with incredibly challenging issues this oil spill constitutes one of the most devastating situations that our community has dealt with in decades,” Carr said. “We are doing everything in our power to protect the health and safety of our residents, our visitors and our natural habitats.”The oil created a miles-wide sheen in the ocean and washed ashore in sticky, black globules.Some birds and fish were caught in the muck and killed, said Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley. But the U.S. Coast Guard said there was a report of just one ruddy duck that was covered in oil and receiving veterinary care. “Other reports of oiled wildlife are being investigated,” the Coast Guard said in a statement.Crews led by the Coast Guard deployed skimmers and some 3,700 feet (1,128 meters) of floating barriers known as booms to try to stop further incursion into areas including Talbert Marsh, a 25-acre (10-hectare) wetland in Huntington Beach, officials said.A petroleum stench permeated the air throughout the area.“You get the taste in the mouth just from the vapors in the air,” Foley said.The oil will likely continue to approach the Orange County coast, including Newport Beach to the south, over the next few days, officials said.The closure included all of Huntington Beach, from the city’s north edge about 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) south to the Santa Ana River jetty. The shutdown came amid summerlike weather that would have brought big crowds to the wide strand for volleyball, swimming and surfing. Yellow caution tape was strung between lifeguard towers to keep people away.Officials canceled the final day of the annual Pacific Air Show that typically draws tens of thousands of spectators to Huntington Beach, a city of about 199,000 residents about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of downtown Los Angeles. The show featured flyovers by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds.The oil slick originated from a pipeline connected to an offshore oil platform known as Elly, Foley said on Twitter. Elly is connected by walkway to another platform, Ellen, located just over 8.5 miles (about 14 kilometers) off Long Beach, according to the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.Foley said Newport Beach Mayor Brad Avery told her that he encountered the oil slick while in a boat traveling back to the mainland from Santa Catalina Island. “He saw dolphins swimming thru the oil,” Foley tweeted.Huntington Beach resident David Rapchun said he’s worried about the impact of the spill on the beaches where he grew up as well as the local economy.“For the amount of oil these things produce I don’t think it’s worth the risk,” Rapchun said. “I’m sure they have long leases but push come to shove these things can change.”He questioned whether drilling for oil was a wise idea along some of Southern California’s most scenic beaches, noting the loss of the final day of the air show could deal a blow to the local economy.“We need oil, but there’s always a question: Do we need it there?” he wondered.The spill comes three decades after a massive oil leak hit the same stretch of Orange County coast. On Feb. 7, 1990, the oil tanker American Trader ran over its anchor off Huntington Beach, spilling nearly 417,000 gallons (1.6 million liters) of crude. Fish and about 3,400 birds were killed.In 2015, a ruptured pipeline north of Santa Barbara sent 143,000 gallons (541,313 liters) of crude oil gushing onto Refugio State Beach.At a news conference Saturday night, Orange County officials expressed concern about the environmental impacts of the spill and hoped crews could stop the oil before it flowed into sensitive wetlands.“We’ve been working with our federal, state and county partners to mitigate the impact that could be a potential ecological disaster,” Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said.The area is home to threatened and endangered species — including a plump shorebird called the snowy plover, the California least tern and humpback whales — a fishing industry and migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway.“The coastal areas off of Southern California are just really rich for wildlife, a key biodiversity hot spot,” said Miyoko Sakashita, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s oceans program.The effects of an oil spill are wide-ranging, environmentalists said. Birds that get oil on their feathers can’t fly, can’t clean themselves and can’t monitor their own temperatures, Sakashita said. Whales, dolphins and other sea creatures can have trouble breathing or die after swimming through oil or breathing in toxic fumes, she said.“The oil spill just shows how dirty and dangerous oil drilling is and oil that gets into the water. It’s impossible to clean it up so it ends up washing up on our beaches and people come into contact with it and wildlife comes in contact with it,” she said. “It has long-lasting effects on the breeding and reproduction of animals. It’s really sad to see this broad swatch oiled.”___Associated Press reporter Felicia Fonseca contributed from Phoenix and Julie Walker contributed from New York.___This story has been updated to correct the metric conversion to 572,807 liters, not 98,420 liters."}, {"title": "'Extreme Numbers' Of Large Invasive Spiders In Georgia May Be A Good Thing", "text": "Georgia residents would be forgiven for being a little creeped out by the thought of copious palm-sized invasive spiders taking up lodging in their state. But scientists say there’s no reason to fear the creatures, which are actually beneficial.Joro spiders are large spiders with bulbous yellow abdomens and thin yellow stripes on their legs. They originally hail from East Asia, but were first spotted in Georgia in 2013. They likely arrived by stowing away in shipping containers, Rick Hoebeke, collections manager the Georgia Museum of Natural History, said in a late September news release from the University of Georgia.“They are great little hitchhikers!” he added.At this point, the spiders are thriving and exist in “extreme numbers” in Georgia, Michele Hatcher of the UGA Department of Entomology told USA Today. The arachnids have also made an appearance in South Carolina.The eight-legged critters don’t seem to be any cause for concern. So far, they haven’t had any negative effect on native species, and they also don’t pose any danger to humans. In fact, they provide a big benefit ― eating pests like mosquitoes, biting flies and stink bugs.That’s why UGA entomologist Nancy Hinkle views them as a “beautiful creature that provides free pest control,” she told the Johnson City Press.She made similar comments in the UGA statement.“Joro spiders present us with excellent opportunities to suppress pests naturally, without chemicals, so I’m trying to convince people that having zillions of large spiders and their webs around is a good thing!” she said.At any rate, the Joro population is so well-established by now that they’re “not going anywhere,” Hoebeke added. However, their population will likely eventually stabilize at a number smaller than it is now.For those — and other — reasons, you should not emulate one Georgia man who set his attic on fire this week in an attempt to eradicate Joro spiders. If the spiders are in your home and bothering you, Christie Grice of the Hall County Fire Marshal’s Office told the Forsyth County News that the best course of action is to sweep away the webs, not go after them with an open flame."}, {"title": "Rare Flower Found At Site Of Planned Lithium Mine May Get Endangered Status", "text": "RENO, Nev. (AP) — Federal wildlife officials proposed endangered species protections Friday for a desert wildflower known to exist only on a remote Nevada ridge where an Australian company plans a lithium mine.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a proposed rule to add Tiehm’s buckwheat to the endangered list, subject to 60 days of public comment.“We find that Tiehm’s buckwheat is in danger of extinction throughout all of its range due to the severity and immediacy of threats currently impacting the species now and those which are likely to occur in the near term,” the agency said.The primary threats are destruction, modification or curtailment of its habitat from mineral exploration and development, road development and other vehicle use, livestock grazing, invasive plant species and herbivory, the agency said. Climate change may further exacerbate the risks, and “existing regulatory mechanisms may be inadequate to protect the species,” it said.The Center for Biological Diversity submitted a petition for the listing in 2019 and filed a lawsuit last year in an effort to force the protections and halt plans for the mine.Officials with Ioneer Ltd., which is constructing the lithium mine on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land southwest of Tonopah, said Friday they have long anticipated the listing and factored efforts to protect the plant into the mine’s design. Lithium is a key element in batteries for electric vehicles.“We fully support the decisions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the work it and the BLM are undertaking to safeguard Tiehm’s buckwheat,” Ioneer managing director Bernard Rowe said in a statement. “Ioneer reiterates its commitment to preservation of this species.”Fewer than 44,000 of the plants are known to exist, the Fish and Wildlife Service said, and the number may be even lower after an unprecedented attack by rodents last summer. The wildflowers are found only between elevations of 5,900 and 6,200 feet (1,800 and 1,900 meters) in eight tiny subpopulations in the Rhyolite Ridge area of the Silver Peak Range, about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.Patrick Donnelly, the Center for Biological Diversity’s Nevada state director, said a survey conducted by the California Botanic Garden this summer found fewer than 16,000 plants.The proposed listing marks a “banner day for native plant conservation,” Donnelly said.“Extinction is a political choice, and the Biden administration made the right call to prevent this special plant from disappearing forever,” he said.Donnelly maintains a formal listing would prevent Ioneer from constructing the mine. However, Rowe said the company is confident that with a “combination of avoidance, propagation and translocation, we can achieve the successful coexistence of Tiehm’s buckwheat and our environmentally significant project.”The Fish and Wildlife Service said potential impact from the proposed mining project, combined with the loss resulting from the recent rodent attack, would reduce the plant’s total population by 70% to 88% — from 43,291 individuals to roughly 5,289 to 8,696 — and remove 30% of its total habitat.It noted Ioneer plans to try to remove and salvage some of the damaged plants by relocating them. But because unoccupied sites are not suitable for all early life stages of the plant and there’s a lack of research, “we are uncertain of the potential for success of translocation efforts.”"}, {"title": "Nutty Squirrel Leaves 42 Gallons Of Nuts In Man's Chevy Avalanche", "text": "A squirrel in Fargo, North Dakota, is really nuts for walnuts ― to the point where it collected 42 gallons of the snack and stored them in a local man’s Chevy Avalanche.Bill Fischer said he came home from a four-day work trip earlier this month and discovered that his truck was filled with black walnuts, each roughly the size of a lime.As his Facebook photos show, the walnuts were tucked into every nook and cranny of the Chevy, including the engine compartment and the fenders. Fischer removed enough to fill seven 6-gallon containers.“I had to pull the fenders off and clean out all the walnuts out, and thought I had them all and took it down the road, turned the corner and found one rolling down the windshield where the wipers go,” Fischer told the Grand Forks Herald.As nutty as this all might seem, it’s “nut” the first time this has happened.Fischer said red squirrels have been using his truck to store walnuts from his neighbor’s tree every two years — the tree’s maturation cycle ― since 2013.“I’ve got other vehicles that sit very close to that tree, and it’s always my truck,” Fischer told The Washington Post. “I’ve even parked purposely out on the street — as far away as I can from the walnut tree — and they still go find the Avalanche and hide them in there.”Over the years, Fischer has learned how to deal with the squirrelly behavior. He knows when the walnuts fall off the tree, it’s time to check the engine. He’s also learned to wait until there are no walnuts left lying under the tree before commencing his cleanup.“The squirrel will sit in the tree and watch me clean up the walnuts almost like: ‘That’s mine, buddy,’ as he’s watching me clean up his winter storage,” Fischer told the Post.Still, he wasn’t prepared for just how many nuts would be squirreled away this year.“The squirrel set a record,” Fischer said. “Most I’ve ever pulled out was four or five 6-gallon buckets. This year was seven.”Fischer had to remove the fenders from the truck to extract some of the nuts, which he is now offering to any human who wants them. “Much to the chagrin of the squirrel,” he’ll throw away any that aren’t claimed, he added.But the squirrel’s cache won’t be completely gone.“I have some rolling around the frame, rails wells as well, that I can’t get at,” Fischer told the Grand Forks Herald."}, {"title": "The Budget Bill Could Place A Fee On Methane, And Big Oil Is Lying Like Hell To Stop It", "text": "The $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package at the center of a heated congressional debate this week represents a unique opportunity for Democrats to advance ambitious climate policies. Among its provisions is a fee on methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas released from a number of sources, including oil and gas operations.The oil and gas industry is desperately fighting this proposed fee by reupping old, disingenuous claims about having an “economic incentive” to curb methane, since it is the main component of natural gas and supposedly valuable to fossil fuel producers. In other words: Don’t worry about our emissions, we’ll take care of them ourselves.But in closed-door meetings, industry leaders have admitted the opposite: Methane gas has very little value. That fact undercuts the idea that it’s in the industry’s best interest to capture that gas and sell it rather than vent and leak it into the atmosphere.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and other progressives introduced a provision in March that would assess a fee of $1,800 per ton of methane pollution beginning in 2023, with a 2% increase above inflation each subsequent year. In September, the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted to include the methane fee in the reconciliation bill, despite vehement Republican opposition.Methane is 86 times more powerful than CO2 over 20 years in the atmosphere and accounts for approximately one-fifth of human-caused planetary warming. Atmospheric concentrations have spiked more than 150% since 1750.Over the last three months, Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and other fossil fuel interests have flooded Facebook with ads opposing the budget bill and its climate provisions. Exxon alone has spent $2 million on Facebook ads over the last three months, CNBC reported this week.In a letter earlier this month to leaders of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the American Petroleum Institute and more than 100 other groups outlined their opposition to what they described as an “unreasonable, punitive” fee on methane pollution that “could jeopardize affordable and reliable energy with likely little reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.”The groups insisted fossil fuel interests are committed to mitigating methane.“Not only is this in the best interest of the environment, it’s in the best economic interests of the nation’s oil and natural gas companies as any methane lost to the atmosphere is product that can’t be used to power our nation’s electric utilities, heat our homes and businesses, fuel our manufacturing facilities, create chemicals used in goods that make us healthier, safer, and more productive, manufacture our steel, or help produce the foods that feed our families,” they wrote.In private, however, oil lobbyists have described methane as an unwanted waste product.“This pesky natural gas, to me, it’s almost like produced water,” Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said at a 2019 gathering of industry groups. “The value of it is very minimal. But you’ve got to manage your gas to produce your oil.”The New York Times first reported Ness’ comments last year after obtaining a recording of the industry meeting organized by the Independent Petroleum Association of America. HuffPost recently obtained a recording and a transcript of the discussion from a source who asked not to be identified.At the event, Ness described methane emissions and flaring as a “serious threat” to the fossil fuel industry’s public image and long-term future.“I’ll tell you, there’s not a more difficult interview to do in anything related to oil and gas than when you’re talking on TV, and they put up a 5,000 barrel a day Bakken well with a flare up and out of it,” Ness said. “Or when all the fishermen across North Dakota don’t need to use their lights on their boats on Lake Sakakawea now because the flares are illuminating the lake.”“We got to go to work,” he added. “We can’t be the deniers anymore.”“I cannot emphasize enough what [Ness] was saying about emissions, and particularly flaring,” said Pete Obermueller, president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. He noted that a Wyoming legislator who he “would assume to be pretty friendly” to industry had recently posted to Facebook about driving through a stretch of the oil-rich Permian Basin and urged Wyoming residents to be careful what they wish for in terms of fossil fuel development.Ness’ view that methane is of little value didn’t keep the North Dakota Petroleum Council from signing on to the September letter in which dozens of groups touted the “economic incentive” to slash emissions. Neither the North Dakota Petroleum Council nor the Independent Petroleum Association of America responded to HuffPost’s request for comment.The oil industry has long fought efforts to regulate methane by arguing that the gas is valuable. When the Obama administration finalized rules to rein in methane emissions on federal lands in 2016, the Independent Petroleum Association of America published a document “debunking” several claims about methane pollution, including that “large quantities of natural gas are wasted during oil and gas production.”“This claim is just not in line with the science,” the IPAA wrote. “Producers have every incentive to capture and sell as much of their product as possible to consumers, rather than letting it escape in the atmosphere.”In fact, drillers are venting and burning off an enormous amount of excess methane. “We’re just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,” Ness acknowledged at the June 2019 industry meeting.In March, a team of Harvard researchers found emissions from oil production are 90% higher than EPA estimates, and emissions from natural gas production are 50% higher. In Texas’ oil-rich Permian Basin, unpermitted flaring of methane is ubiquitous, according to a recent report from the conservation group Earthworks.Of 227 active flares that were surveyed during a series of flyovers between January and June 2020, 192 of them — 84% — did not have a necessary permit from the Texas Railroad Commission, that study found. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, warned in its most recent climate report that slashing methane and other so-called super pollutants could go a long way toward staving off additional planetary warming.The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s largest trade association, recently came out in support of a pledge from the Biden administration and the European Union to reduce methane pollution at least 30% over the next decade. (The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to finalize stricter rules on methane in the coming weeks.)Whitehouse isn’t buying the industry’s purported support.“Anyone who believes @APIenergy needs to have their head examined,” he tweeted earlier this month. “This is a dodge to avoid the methane fee. Then they’ll fight and delay the regs, directly or through coordinated front groups. Fool me once…”"}, {"title": "Tracy Stone-Manning Confirmed As Biden's Public Lands Chief", "text": "Tracy Stone-Manning was confirmed to lead the federal Bureau of Land Management on Thursday following a contentious confirmation process in which Republicans and conservative media labeled her an “eco-terrorist” and “violent extremist” for her connection to a tree-spiking incident in the late-1980s.Stone-Manning, a senior adviser for conservation policy at the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation and a former aide to Montana Democrats, will become the first confirmed director since Neil Kornze led the bureau under President Barack Obama. She’ll be charged with overseeing 245 million acres of federal land ― more than 10% of the entire U.S. landmass ―and 700 million subsurface mineral acres.The Senate confirmed Stone-Manning with a 50-45 vote, along party lines, with several Republicans absent.Republicans vehemently opposed Stone-Manning’s nomination, accusing her of not only playing a key role in a radical environmental group’s plot to hammer metal spikes into trees in Idaho’s Clearwater National Forest in 1989 to prevent them from being logged, but lying to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee about her involvement.As a graduate student at the University of Montana, Stone-Manning acted as a spokesperson for Earth First!, a group that had vandalized ski resorts and occupied forests to prevent timber from being harvested. In 1989, she retyped a letter that an organization member gave to her and sent it to the U.S. Forest Service. It warned that trees slated to be cut down had been spiked and contained threatening language, including “You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could get hurt.”Tree-spiking is an act of sabotage meant to deter loggers from harvesting trees, and there have been incidents of forest and mill workers being severely injured when saw blades come in contact with the hidden spikes.Stone-Manning has maintained for decades that she only sent the letter to prevent people from getting hurt and was never a target of the federal investigation. In the early 1990s, Stone-Manning testified against two people who ultimately went to prison for the crime.But an investigator in the case and one of the convicted tree-spikers recently challenged her account. In a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee after her confirmation hearing, retired U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Michael Merkley wrote that Stone-Manning was in fact a target of the investigation, “was not an innocent bystander” and came forward only after her attorney struck an immunity deal with prosecutors. John Blount, one of two men convicted in the case, told E&E News that Stone-Manning did not participate in planning the spiking but “knew about it far in advance.”The other convicted tree-spiker, Jeff Fairchild, told The Washington Post that aside from mailing the letter, Stone-Manning “knew nothing and was not involved.” He described her as a “bridge builder” and “a moderating voice in every discussion.”Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the ranking Republican on the Senate energy committee, led the effort to sink her nomination.“Ms. Stone-Manning helped plan the tree-spiking. She knew about it in advance. She sent the threatening letter to the Forest Service. She was investigated. She collaborated with eco-terrorists. She lied to the Senate,” he said in a speech on the Senate floor in July. “Lying to the United States Senate has consequences. In this case, her actions and her lies should cost her this nomination.”Dozens of Republican lawmakers called on Biden to withdraw her nomination, and in the end, not one Republican supported her for the role. But the administration stood behind her, and Senate Democrats slammed their GOP colleagues for running a political smear campaign.“They have dragged a good person’s name through the muck,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), whom Stone-Manning worked for for six years in Montana, said in a July floor speech. The Republican campaign against her, he added, was “particularly galling” considering many of those involved supported William Perry Pendley, an anti-public lands extremist who illegally led the bureau as its acting director under President Donald Trump. Pendley, a conservative lawyer, has a long record of arguing that public lands should not even exist and has ridiculed Native Americans over their religious beliefs.Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) called Republican colleagues’ treatment of Stone-Manning “the worst example of character assassination” he’d witnessed during his time on the committee. He reminded them of their own actions following the January insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.“We know a lot more about domestic terrorism than any of us would like because we had a front-row seat to it on Jan. 6 of this year,” he said during a hearing. “And more than a few members of this committee refused to hold the instigator of that responsible, and yet they’re hellbent on dragging Ms. Stone-Manning’s name through the mud.”Stone-Manning will take the helm of the bureau as the Biden administration works to finalize a major review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. The Interior Department, the parent agency of the BLM, paused new federal leases in January pending the outcome of that review, but a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the moratorium in June. Interior officials have said the oil and gas leasing program currently is “not serving the American public well.”Stone-Manning has called the current system “broken” and advocated for major reforms to better protect public lands and wildlife.“At the BLM, she will bring nonpartisan stewardship to our nation’s greatest treasures,” Tester said in July. “Tracy is dedicated to smart management of our public lands. She is dedicated to the habitat and to the outdoors.”"}, {"title": "Fat Bear Week Celebrates Alaska's Most Flab-ulous In A Bruin Bulge-Off", "text": "May the chonkiest win!Fat Bear Week pits the brown bears of Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve against each other in a contest to determine the most pleasingly plump.

Blah blah blah,” she said, quoting political efforts by the leaders. “This is not about some expensive, politically correct green act of bunny hugging or blah blah blah. ‘Build back better,’ blah blah blah, ‘Green economy,’ blah blah blah.”“This is all we hear from our so-called leaders,” she continued. “Words. Words that sound great but so far has led to no action. Our hopes and dreams drown in their empty words and promises.”The UN has released a series of troubling reports in recent months foreshadowing a bleak future even if the planet meets many of its promised emissions cuts. An assessment in August found the burning of fossil fuels had already locked in intensive climate change for the next 30 years, consequences of which could result in more frequent and more severe environmental disasters including heat waves, storms, droughts and wildfires.The body’s secretary-general called the document a “code red for humanity.”Thunberg on Tuesday said leaders’ ongoing pledges to address climate change had come up short for decades. Young people at the Youth4Climate summit will create a list of recommendations this week that will then be taken to the UN’s COP26 next month where emissions targets set for 2030 are expected to be hashed out.“Right now we are still very much speeding in the wrong direction.

I’m a bit sore in the arm, of course, but, yeah, I survived it,” he told Nine Network television.Dearly had his right hand and forearm in a cast, but did not detail his injuries. He had undergone surgery to repair a severed tendon in his hand, the Northern Territory News reported.Dearly said he told the 18 tourists on his cruise on Monday to keep their entire bodies inside the boat at all times for safety.He then did the opposite when he decided to retrieve a pole he had been using to feed meat to raptors and had dropped overboard.He was about to grab the pole and “immediately something lunged on to me,” Dearly said.The crocodile remained clamped on to his arm as he drew back.“I’ve lifted a crocodile up and I’ve gone: ‘My god, what have I got here?’ And I’m thinking: ‘What are we going to do about this? It’s hanging off my arm,’” Dearly said.Dearly said he hoped the crocodile would not twist its body, which could have caused more serious tearing wounds and potentially dragged him overboard.“If it had gone into a twist, it would have given me a bit of grief,” Dearly said.“It went for another bite and it actually released its grip and I just got my arm out as soon as it released. So I was pretty lucky it dropped back down in the water,” he added.An ambulance was called to the scene but Dearly had already left in a car to make the hourlong journey to the nearest hospital at Palmerston, near Darwin.“If it had been one of our bigger crocodiles, we’ve got Brutus and the Dominator up the river there, massive animals,” Dearly said, referring to Adelaide River crocs that are respectively 5.5 meters (18 feet) and 6 meters (20 feet) long."}, {"title": "US Says Ivory-Billed Woodpecker, 22 Other Species Extinct", "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Death’s come knocking a last time for the splendid ivory-billed woodpecker and 22 more birds, fish and other species: The U.S. government is declaring them extinct.It’s a rare move for wildlife officials to give up hope on a plant or animal, but government scientists say they’ve exhausted efforts to find these 23. And they warn climate change, on top of other pressures, could make such disappearances more common as a warming planet adds to the dangers facing imperiled plants and wildlife.The ivory-billed woodpecker was perhaps the best known species the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday will announce is extinct. It went out stubbornly and with fanfare, making unconfirmed appearances in recent decades that ignited a frenzy of ultimately fruitless searches in the swamps of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida.Others such as the flat pigtoe, a freshwater mussel in the southeastern U.S., were identified in the wild only a few times and never seen again, meaning by the time they got a name they were fading from existence.“When I see one of those really rare ones, it’s always in the back of my mind that I might be the last one to see this animal again,” said Anthony “Andy” Ford, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Tennessee who specializes in freshwater mussels.The factors behind the disappearances vary — too much development, water pollution, logging, competition from invasive species, birds killed for feathers and animals captured by private collectors. In each case, humans were the ultimate cause.Another thing they share: All 23 were thought to have at least a slim chance of survival when added to the endangered species list beginning in the 1960s. Only 11 species previously have been removed due to extinction in the almost half-century since the Endangered Species Act was signed into law. Wednesday’s announcement kicks off a three-month comment period before the species status changes become final.Around the globe, some 902 species have been documented as extinct. The actual number is thought to be much higher because some are never formally identified, and many scientists warn the earth is in an “extinction crisis” with flora and fauna now disappearing at 1,000 times the historical rate.It’s possible one or more of the 23 species included in Wednesday’s announcement could reappear, several scientists said.A leading figure in the hunt for the ivory-billed woodpecker said it was premature to call off the effort, after millions of dollars spent on searches and habitat preservation efforts.“Little is gained and much is lost” with an extinction declaration, said Cornell University bird biologist John Fitzpatrick, lead author of a 2005 study that claimed the woodpecker had been rediscovered in eastern Arkansas.“A bird this iconic, and this representative of the major old-growth forests of the southeast, keeping it on the list of endangered species keeps attention on it, keeps states thinking about managing habitat on the off chance it still exists,” he said.The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a Switzerland-based group that tracks extinctions globally, is not putting the ivory-billed woodpecker into its extinction column because it’s possible the birds still exist in Cuba, said the group’s Craig Hilton-Taylor.Hilton-Taylor said there can be unintended but damaging consequences if extinction is declared prematurely. “Suddenly the (conservation) money is no longer there, and then suddenly you do drive it to extinction because you stop investing in it,” he said.Federal officials said the extinctions declaration was driven by a desire to clear a backlog of recommended status changes for species that had not been acted upon for years. They said it would free up resources for on-the-ground conservation efforts for species that still have a chance for recovery.What’s lost when those efforts fail are creatures often uniquely adapted to their environments. Freshwater mussel species like the ones the government says have gone extinct reproduce by attracting fish with a lure-like appendage, then sending out a cloud of larvae that attach to gills of fish until they’ve grown enough to drop off and live on their own.The odds are slim against any mussel surviving into adulthood — a one in a million chance, according to Ford of the wildlife service — but those that do can live a century or longer.Hawaii has the most species on the list — eight woodland birds and one plant. That’s in part because the islands have so many plants and animals that many have extremely small ranges and can blink out quickly.The most recent to go extinct was the teeny po’ouli, a type of bird known as a honeycreeper discovered in 1973.By the late 1990s just three remained — a male and two females. After failures to mate them in the wild, the male was captured for potential breeding and died in 2004. The two females were never seen again.The fate of Hawaii’s birds helped push Duke University extinction expert Stuart Pimm into his field. Despite the grim nature of the government’s proposal to move more species into the extinct column, Pimm said the toll would probably have been much higher without the Endangered Species Act.“It’s a shame we didn’t get to those species in time, but when we do, we are usually able to save species,” he said.Since 1975, 54 species have left the endangered list after recovering, including the bald eagle, brown pelican and most humpback whales.Climate change is making species recovery harder, bringing drought, floods, wildfires and temperature swings that compound the threats species already faced.How they are saved also is changing. No longer is the focus on individual species, let alone individual birds. Officials say the broader goal now is to preserve their habitat, which boosts species of all types that live there.“I hope we’re up to the challenge,” said biologist Michelle Bogardus with the wildlife service in Hawaii. “We don’t have the resources to prevent extinctions unilaterally. We have to think proactively about ecosystem health and how do we maintain it, given all these threats.”___"}, {"title": "What A 1921 Texas Flood Tells Us About The Latino Climate Struggle Today", "text": "It was two days before Yom Kippur, and Char Miller was thinking about the dead.The Pomona College environmental historian had dedicated the entire final chapter of “West Side Rising,” his new book on the deadly 1921 storm that laid waste to San Antonio’s mostly Latino barrios and sowed the seeds of the community’s environmental justice movement, to naming every victim he could identify. To Miller, it represented a version of the Jewish tradition of listing the recently deceased at the start of services at synagogues on Yom Kippur, when Jews fast and pray to atone for their sins.“As a Jew, that’s one of the things we do every year … and it seemed to me that was something the book should do, because the city didn’t just undercount them, it basically erased those who died,” Miller told me. “The goal was to honor those who had died, to give them a name, and thereby to give them a voice.”Entire families, wiped out in the floodwaters, cry out from the pages of “West Side Rising.” The de la Garzas of McAskill Street lost not just 35-year-old Petra, but a whole next generation: Onesema, 4, Carlota, 3, Lontardo, 1. The frequency with which single-digit ages followed the names is nauseating. The Caradenas siblings of Mitchell Street — Felipe, 6, Theodora, 2, and Louisa, just 15 days — all dead. Their neighbors, the Morales family, only recovered the body of Francisca, 36. The seven children and their father were relegated to an eternal limbo in the public records as “missing.”Virtually all the victims were Latino. Even the one person to die in the whiter, richer downtown area had a Spanish last name.It’s a relevant story today. More than half of Latino Americans live in California, Texas and Florida, three states struggling to beat back the record-breaking droughts, heat and flooding scientists say are just a taste of the warming to come. The Environmental Protection Agency’s own numbers show nonwhite Americans in general breathe air that’s 1.28 times more densely polluted with cancer-causing pollution particles compared the national average. And a University of Minnesota study found in 2019 that Latinos in the U.S. are exposed on average to air that has 63% more pollution than what is caused by their own consumption.In the immediate aftermath of the flood 100 years ago, a mutual aid society called Cruz Azul Mexicana sprang to action to help the inundated. It quickly spread from San Antonio to towns across the region. The group offered the first unified front aimed at helping Latinos who had long borne the consequences of their European-descended rulers’ preference for building settlements in floodplains. By the 1970s, the network Cruz Azul built formed the connective tissue for an even meatier kind of Latino political organization to finally seize some power and begin to deliver on long-promised reforms.In what felt like a microcosm of how the ripples of a single event can travel even further, Miller received an email shortly after his book was reviewed this month in the San Antonio Express-News. The message came from a grave restorationist at one of the city’s cemeteries, who had just refurbished the weathered headstone marking in Spanish where a woman and her child were buried. They had died during the flood.“I knew it wasn’t a complete record that I was able to build, but you’ve got to do what you can,” Miller said. “If there’s a second edition, that family will be honored in there.”This interview, carried out over two phone calls, was edited and condensed for clarity.To start, what happened in San Antonio on Sept. 9, 1921?The title of your book talks about the Latino movement this began. I imagine most of these people were of Mexican background, given the geographical location. Obviously the term Latino represents an extremely diverse array of peoples that often, in the context of U.S. politics, have divergent interests, as we saw from the 2020 election results. With that in mind, is there a limit to the lessons that can be learned from this catastrophe and its political aftermath?San Antonio is a particular kind of place. It is set within a geography that floods in the way it does not in many other places in the United States. But one of the things that COPS and its predecessor, a mutual aid society called Cruz Azul Mexicana that emerged from the 1921 flood, recognized was that the tools of their organizing could be scaled up across the region. They carried the banner across the state of Texas and to major cities and small ones to help protect their even smaller Hispanic communities, politically, socially and economically. They saw that the organizing could be transferred to Houston and Dallas and Chicago and Phoenix and Los Angeles to help communities in those places to organize around environmental justice issues that they confronted, which were strikingly different.The nature of the organizing was the same, even if the nature of the place was different. So some of this is recognizing that place matters enormously. So it’s important to build coalitions that can then trade best practices.One thing that really stuck out to me reading this, particularly when it came to the undercounting of the death toll, was the similarities between what happened in San Antonio and 2017’s Hurricane María in Puerto Rico. To what degree do you see parallels there?When I started to realize that what the city posted as the final death count of 51, which did not count anybody who was “missing,” even though we knew they were dead, I started to find stories that indicated that there were more. In fact, I just found out about another person, who sent me a picture of a gravestone he had just restored with a name of someone who had died in the 1921 flood but had appeared nowhere in any record, whether in the Spanish-language newspapers or the English-language newspapers. Back in the day, nobody looked beyond the immediate environment. They didn’t think about the bodies being carried miles downstream. They only looked a mile down the river. So, some of this is just bad investigation.Some of it is deliberate. What the city of San Antonio did ― which also happened in Puerto Rico and in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and in modern contexts where we have much better data ― was to undercount. They do this so you can say to the world, “Well, it wasn’t really that bad. So let’s defend our tourist industry. Let’s defend our understanding that storms aren’t as brutal as, in fact, they actually are.” I would say San Antonio was in climate denial in 1921 just as badly as many places are still today. But it’s maddening. People died. Let’s tell that truth.That’s an interesting use of the term “climate denial,” particularly since the book basically never mentions climate change. Normally that term refers to adherents of the fossil fuel industry’s misinformation about how burning oil, gas and coal heats the planet. Can you expound on that a bit more?What helped me understand what happened in San Antonio, a place I lived for many years, was recognizing one key factor that the Spanish understood but could not resolve. When they arrived in the 18th century, they knew they were going to plant a city and literally have a city support itself through agriculture. To do agriculture, you need water, and they had some of the best engineers in terms of irrigation. They created irrigation ditches all over the city to bring water in from various parts. That’s fascinating technologically, except that also meant you had to live within a floodplain. They did the exact same thing in Los Angeles and the Salt River Valley of Phoenix. They built within the floodplain. So when they got flooded with an adobe city that literally melted when heavy water hit it, they just simply rebuilt. They were building in danger. But when the Americans arrived, they did the exact same thing. They knew better ― they talked about it all the time ― but they just denied the reality or pushed off that reality. In the short term, it was good for us. But in the long term, it wasn’t.In New Orleans, which was constructed in the 18th century, it was the exact same situation. The only high ground is in the French Quarter, and everything else gets submerged. Look at Miami today. The city is at sea level, the sea rises and actually comes up through the water sources. The city is going to be destroyed, but what the city is doing is taxing buildings so they can build a sea wall. A sea wall isn’t going to stop it.It’s happening also in the western cities going up in smoke. The first thing they do is rebuild in the exact same place that was incinerated. Even with all the data that we have at our disposal, we have a level of denial today that is just mind boggling. And it does not bode well for the rest of the 21st century.What made you want to tell this story in the first place?When we moved to San Antonio in 1981, I became fascinated by the dam. It was not far from my home. It’s a very impressive object. But it became pretty clear shortly thereafter that that dam, which protected downtown, did nothing for the other parts of the community. I wondered why, and why similar structures of one form or another existed in parts of clearly flood-prone neighborhoods. Every time it rained, something was underwater. So I began playing around with that. It wasn’t until the late ’80s, when other projects got completed, that I started digging into how San Antonio spends its money on flood control ― and where it decided not to. I started by walking in the areas that were unprotected and more flood vulnerable, and realized, oh my God, there’s a story here.In the last five years, as most of the local newspapers became digitized, it became easier to do the research. It was literally an on-the-ground approach, walking. That led to archives and to interviews and to talks where people would come up afterwards and say, “My grandmother went through that flood.”It seems only fair to acknowledge the fact that we’re two white Jewish guys talking about a Latino struggle. In the course of researching this book, was there any point at which you felt like an interloper? How did you deal with that?That sort of positionality issue was very clear to me from the get-go, that to be an ally of Latinx activism and communities in San Antonio meant taking your cues from those communities. Frankly, had a local colleague decided to write this book, I would have stepped back and done something else. I floated various essays at various times to see if there was any interest on the one hand, and if anyone was doing it."}, {"title": "Alaska Officials On The Hunt For Aggressive Otter Group After Attacks", "text": "Wildlife officials in Anchorage, Alaska, have issued a warning about aggressive otters after three reported attacks on humans and pets.On Friday, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game implored the city’s residents to “be alert around local lakes and rivers” after a spate of incidents that may or may not have involved the same otter group:On Sept. 1, a river otter bit 9-year-old Ayden Fernandez at a duck pond in East Anchorage. Ayden’s mother, Tiffany, showed the Anchorage Daily News a video in which one otter broke away from a group and chased her two sons and their friends. The children all ran, but the otter caught up to Ayden, biting him on both legs, his foot and his back as he fell to the ground.The Fish and Game Department’s statement said, “It is possible that the same group of river otters were responsible,” noting that river otters can travel to different areas over both land and water.If found, the otters’ fate is likely grim. The department noted it will have to “remove” them from the area and that relocation would be “problematic” due to their demonstrated dangerous behavior. Any otters killed will also be tested for rabies. (Animals must be dead to be tested for rabies because the test requires brain tissue samples.)The department noted, however, that officials will be careful only to remove otters exhibiting unusually aggressive behavior.In November 2019, an otter attacked a dog at Anchorage’s University Lake, though the dog’s owner didn’t get a clear enough glimpse to tell if the aquatic aggressor was an otter or a beaver.“They made a beeline through the water,” Labradoodle owner Carol Stratton told local news station KTUU at the time. “I called for [my dog] and bam. They pulled her under at least twice. It was horrifying.”And in October 2019, four otters went after a dog at a different lake in Anchorage, biting and pulling a 50-pound husky mix under the surface, the dog’s owner told Alaska Public Media. Ultimately, the owner had to jump into the water to fight off the otters."}, {"title": "COVID-Sick Zoo Lions Fed 'Tempting' Baby Food, Chicken Broth To Amp Up Appetites", "text": "Some of the big cats who tested positive for COVID-19 last week at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., have been struggling with lack of appetite, so zookeepers have had to get creative.“We saw a real decrease in appetite interest, so this week they’ve done more to stimulate their appetite,” spokesperson Pamela Baker-Masson told The Washington Post.That means baby food, chicken broth, goat milk, goat cheese and elk meat, with the goal of making food “as tempting as possible,” according to a zoo news release .Six lions and three tigers tested “presumptive positive” for the virus last week, meaning that laboratory results came back positive but they hadn’t yet been confirmed by a federal lab. That confirmation still hasn’t come in, but the initial results, combined with the cats’ symptoms ― including coughing, sneezing and lethargy along with the appetite loss ― have left the zoo certain that the animals indeed have COVID-19.The tests were conducted using fecal samples from the lions and tigers, not nose swabs.The zoo’s Friday statement said that all three tigers and three of the lions were getting better and eating normally, but the other three lions ― males Shaka and Jumbe, both 7, and female Shera, 17 ― were of “greater concern.” Shaka and Jumbe were both still lethargic, coughing and had runny noses and low appetites. Those three have been treated with fluid therapy and various medications.Additionally, diagnostic bloodwork from Shera showed that the elderly lion was in renal failure, though it was not immediately clear whether this was at all related to the virus.The zoo was not sure how the animals contracted the coronavirus, but an earlier statement noted it could have possibly been transmitted by an asymptomatic staffer.Some zoo animals around the United States have begun to be vaccinated with the Zoetis vaccine, a shot made specifically for animals. The National Zoo plans to vaccinate some of its residents in the next few months, according to The Washington Post.Various animals in zoos have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began, including other tigers, otters, gorillas and snow leopards."}, {"title": "Bronx Zoo Visitors Go Bananas Watching Gorillas Engage In Oral Sex (NSFW)", "text": "Tongues are wagging on social media over a video taken at New York City’s Bronx Zoo that shows one gorilla performing oral sex on another.The video, which was filmed Wednesday, shows one gorilla lying on its back as another pleasures it.The videographer behind the clip told the New York Post that he was visiting the gorilla exhibit with his 4-year-old daughter and his niece.“My wife had to stay out of the exhibit with my sleeping son, so I wanted to capture a lot of video,” said the man, who was not named in the Post’s story. “Then this magic happened.”Video posted by TMZ shows parents quickly moving to hide their kids’ eyes from the amorous apes.

In a fact sheet, it touted the action as “one of the most impactful federal efforts to reduce climate pollution in decades.”“It’s a win for our workers, our climate and our country,” White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy told reporters in a call Wednesday.The effort fulfills a key directive of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, which Congress passed with bipartisan support last year, as well as charts a path for the Biden administration to ultimately ratify an international deal to phase out HFCs. That global pact, known as the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, was signed by 197 countries in October 2016. In January, Biden signed an executive order directing the State Department to transmit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for its advice and consent.McCarthy told reporters Biden remains committed to submitting the Kigali Amendment for ratification, but she didn’t have an update on timing.“The important thing,” she said, “is it really sends a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is in — we are all in on climate change — but equally importantly, if it sends a signal to the rest of the countries that they should be moving forward on the Kigali Amendment, then it could in the end have tremendous benefits.”Scientists estimate that worldwide implementation of the HFC pact would stave off half a degree Celsius of global warming over this century.Along with finalizing the EPA rule, the Biden administration will establish an interagency task force to crack down on the illegal trade of HFCs and invest $8 million over five years to identify and develop HFC alternatives.“Moving from HFCs to climate-friendlier alternatives is an important part of President Biden’s plan to meet the climate crisis by cutting America’s heat-trapping emissions at least in half by 2030 — with big benefits for jobs, our health and a safer future,” David Doniger, senior strategic director for climate at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.Thursday’s actions come amid Climate Week in New York and the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan. During a speech at the assembly on Tuesday, Biden pledged to double U.S. spending on international climate aid by 2024, from $5.6 billion to $11.4 billion.

The agency said at the time that it analyzed a number of potential impacts, including drought, wildfire and climate change, and found that neither of the two species of Joshua trees, Yucca brevifolia or Yucca jaegeriana, warranted federal protection.U.S. District Judge Otis Wright, an appointee of President George W. Bush, slammed the federal agency in his Wednesday opinion and sided with WildEarth Guardians, which argued that the federal agency disregarded science showing the myriad ways in which climate impacts threaten the trees’ long-term survival.“The Service’s climate change conclusions are arbitrary and capricious because the Service disregarded material data and failed to explain why,” Wright wrote. “The Service’s findings regarding threats posed by climate change and wildfire are unsupported, speculative, or irrational.”The ruling stems from a lawsuit that WildEarth Guardians, a New Mexico-based environmental group, filed in 2019 challenging the Trump administration’s decision.Jennifer Schwartz, a staff attorney for WildEarth Guardians, called the ruling “a monumental step forward” for not only the Joshua tree but also for all climate-imperiled species.“The Court’s unequivocal holding — that the Service cannot summarily dismiss scientific evidence that runs counter to its conclusions — will force the federal government to confront the reality of climate change and begin focusing on how to help species adapt,” she said in a statement.The ruling directs FWS to reconsider listing the Joshua tree using best-available science and issue a new finding within one year. The Biden administration has so far defended the Trump-era decision in court.FWS did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Wednesday.The Trump administration spent four years at war with climate science. It downplayed and dismissed the global threat in its quest to boost fossil fuel production. It shut down panels on climate science, worked to limit the types of studies that can be used in drafting policy, and even altered and scrubbed scientific data on the environmental impacts of natural resource extraction. President Donald Trump’s Interior Department, which was led by a number of officials who detested the Endangered Species Act, not only used flawed or incomplete data to strip away or deny species protections but also weakened the law amid a worsening extinction crisis.The Biden administration has since moved to reverse Trump’s rollbacks to the ESA.The slow-growing Joshua tree is native to the U.S. Southwest, including the Mojave Desert.

It’s Still A Fraction Of What’s Needed.", "text": "President Joe Biden vowed Tuesday to double U.S. spending on international climate aid to $11.4 billion per year by 2024, a move that would significantly expand the pot of money available for poorer countries to develop clean energy and adapt to the already brutal effects of warming.The pledge, announced during the first-year president’s debut speech before the United Nations, comes almost exactly six months after Biden doubled the previous U.S. commitment to $5.6 billion.The decision showed a clean break from former President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from the global pact to cut carbon emissions and canceled all payments to the world’s main climate aid fund. Trump’s predecessor, former President Barack Obama, had pledged $3 billion to the fund, but paid out just $1 billion before his Republican successor took office.“We’ll work with the Congress to double that number again, including for adaptation efforts,” Biden said before the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan. “This will make the United States a leader in public climate finance.”Yet even the quadrupled annual figure falls far short of what U.S. allies are contributing, and represents roughly one-eighth of what the world’s largest historical emitter would need to pay to account for its cumulative share of carbon heating the planet.The U.S. has spewed the second-most carbon into the atmosphere each year since 2006, when China, with its ravenous appetite for coal, took the top slot. But Americans’ love of gas guzzlers, big suburban houses, and cheap plastic goods makes the U.S. the largest per capita emitter by far. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for over a century, preventing the sun’s heat from escaping back into space and heating the planet all the while, meaning the U.S.’s nearly 200 years of industrial pollution make up the lion’s share of the emissions causing climate change today.Accounting for that reality, the U.S. would need to spend $800 billion on climate aid to the rest of the world by 2030, according to an analysis put forward earlier this year by a diverse coalition of more than 1,300 civil society groups. That’s close to $89 billion per year, nearly eight times what Biden pledged Tuesday.The new proposal even fails to match more conservative estimates of what the U.S. owes the rest of the world. The U.S. fell dead last on a list of countries that compared total historical emissions to existing climate finance pledges. The ranking from the Overseas Development Institute, a London-based think tank, calculated that the U.S. should have donated a little over $43 billion between 2017 and 2018.Tuesday’s pledge is even shy of the $12 billion per year an alliance of U.S. nonprofits, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Oxfam America, proposed this week.“This was a very significant ramp up, however it’s definitely not the U.S.’s fair share,” Rachel Cleetus, the climate policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said by phone Tuesday after the president’s speech. “More will need to be done in the years ahead.”The rich world promised more than a decade ago to muster $100 billion per year to help countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America skip the fossil fuel phase of economic development and fortify themselves against the droughts, flooding, and extreme weather already disproportionately afflicting them.Yet by 2019, the North American and European nations that grew wealthy burning fossil fuels and chopping down forests over the past two centuries contributed just $79.6 billion to the fund, more than $20 billion less than was promised, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of rich countries, found in a report published last week.The European Union and its members already give developing countries about $25 billion per year, and the European Commission vowed this month to increase that by nearly $4.7 billion.“My message today is that Europe is ready to do more,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in her State of the European Union speech last Wednesday. “But we expect the United States and our partners to step up too.”A truly “fair share” spending figure from the U.S. would amount to an eye-popping number. But the U.S. spent $714 billion on its military in 2020 alone, despite repeated warnings that the Pentagon does too little to root out profligate spending and graft by private contractors, going as far as to hide an internal study that estimated wasteful bureaucratic costs at $125 billion.For comparison, the cost of building a single U.S. aircraft carrier this year will likely exceed what Biden has proposed to help other countries deal with climate change by more than $1 billion.Military spending is often contrasted with policy issues the U.S. badly needs to fund but fails to prioritize, such as basic infrastructure, education, or health care. But the comparison is uniquely relevant with climate change. Already, increasingly scarce freshwater supplies are stoking regional tensions. Some researchers connect the civil war in Syria, which created a refugee crisis that served to destabilize Europe and neighboring countries, to a prolonged drought that drove more than a million rural workers from the countryside to cities as crops failed. Twelve of the 20 countries deemed most vulnerable to warming impacts are mired in conflict, and studies indicate that number will likely grow as average temperatures rise.The Pentagon, even under Trump, indicated that extreme weather and less predictable resources pose an almost certain risk of more wars, terrorism, and the very violence a well-armed military is supposed to guard the American population against. Helping other countries cut their emissions and avoid social and ecological upheaval should decrease the likelihood of armed conflict.“The ambitious call we’re making actually makes sense when you look at it juxtaposed to what we spend on the military,” said the Rev. Michael Malcom, an ordained minister and the executive director of The People’s Justice Council, a grassroots climate justice group. “If we would take away from our death-dealing devices and invest in life-giving measures, we can make it happen.”Yet Biden will need Congress to authorize the $11.4 billion per year in aid funding at a time when members of the president’s own party say they are reluctant to approve a politically popular $4 trillion budget aimed at building infrastructure and hastening the transition to clean energy and electric vehicles.Despite the White House’s request to keep the Pentagon budget flat at $715 billion, congressional Democrats voted with Republicans this month to increase the military’s spending by $24 billion."}, {"title": "Bison Charges And Hurls Another Bison In Yellowstone Showdown", "text": "Well, blow me down.

Huge red plumes topped with black-and-white smoke shot out along the Cumbre Vieja volcanic ridge, which scientists had been closely watching following the accumulation of molten lava below the surface and days of small earthquakes.La Palma, with a population of 85,000, is one of eight islands in Spain’s Canary Islands archipelago off Africa’s western coast. At their nearest point, they are 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Morocco.A 4.2-magnitude quake was recorded before the volcanic eruption, which took place in an area known as Cabeza de Vaca on the western slope as the ridge descends to the coast. Tinges of red could be seen at the bottom of the black jets that shot rocks into the air.One black lava flow with a burning tip was sliding toward houses in the village of El Paso. Mayor Sergio Rodríguez said 300 people in immediate danger had been evacuated and sent to the El Paso soccer field. Roads were closed due to the explosion and authorities urged the curious not to approach the area.Mariano Hernández, president of La Palma island, said there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries but that the lava flows made him concerned “about the populated areas on the coast.” He said there were five eruption points, of which two were spewing magma.“People should not come near the eruption site where the lava is flowing,” Hernández said. “We are having serious problems with the evacuation because the roads are jammed with people who are trying to get close enough to see it.”Itahiza Dominguez, head of seismology of Spain’s National Geology Institute, told Canary Islands Television that although it was too early to tell how long this eruption would last, prior “eruptions on the Canary Islands lasted weeks or even months.”The last eruption on La Palma 50 years ago lasted just over three weeks. The last eruption on all the Canary Islands occurred underwater off the coast of El Hierro island in 2011. It lasted five months.The first hours of the eruption led volcanologist Vicente Soler of Spain’s Higher Council to believe that it was not terribly violent.″(But) the material appears to be very fluid, the lava flows will reach the sea sooner or later,” Soler told Canary Islands Television.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez cancelled his trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly so he could travel from Spain’s mainland to the Canary Islands.After days of what scientists call an “earthquake swarm,” authorities on La Palma on Sunday started to evacuate residents with reduced mobility to a military outpost shortly before ground broke open. Residents of five nearby villages were already on alert to leave their homes in case of an eruption.The Scientific Committee of the Volcano Risk Prevention Plan said stronger earthquakes “are likely to be felt and may cause damage to buildings.” It also said part of the island’s southwest coast was at risk for landslides and rock falls.___Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona."}, {"title": "The World's Largest Tree At Risk As California Wildfires Head Toward Giant Sequoia Groves", "text": "THREE RIVERS, Calif. (AP) — Crews were watching the weather this weekend as they battled California wildfires that have burned into some groves of ancient sequoias as they try to protect the world’s largest tree.The National Weather Service issued a weather watch for critical fire conditions in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada, where two lightning-caused fires merged Friday after making its largest growth in a week. The fire reached the western tip of the Giant Forest, where it burned four sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that flank the road into the grove of 2,000 sequoias.The extent of the fire’s damage on the trees has not been determined.Firefighters have wrapped the base of the General Sherman Tree, along with other trees in the Giant Forest, in fire-resistant aluminum of the type used in wildland firefighter emergency shelters and to protect historic wooden buildings, fire spokeswoman Katy Hooper said.The General Sherman Tree is the largest in the world by volume, at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), according to the National Park Service. It towers 275 feet (84 meters) high and has a circumference of 103 feet (31 meters) at ground level.The fires, known together as the KNP Complex, burned 28 square miles (72 square kilometers) of forest land after making a significant run Friday. Low-hanging smoke that had choked off air and limited the fire’s growth in recent days lifted, and gusts increased fire activity particularly near the Giant Forest, Hooper said.The flames chased away firefighters who were wrapping the sequoias in aluminum and clearing vegetation on the forest floor that would intensify fire close to the trees, Hooper said. A hotshot crew was assessing conditions near the Four Guardsmen Saturday morning to determine whether firefighters can safely go back and continue the work, she said.The fires forced the evacuation of the park this week, and parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people outside the park’s main entrance. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community.The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying some gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread.However, fire officials weren’t expecting the kinds of explosive wind-driven growth that in recent months turned Sierra Nevada blazes into monsters that devoured hundreds of homes.Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires — fueled by climate change — can overwhelm the trees.“Once you get fire burning inside the tree, that will result in mortality,” said Jon Wallace, the operations section chief for the KNP Complex.The fires already have burned into several groves containing trees as tall as 200 feet (61 meters) feet tall and 2,000 years old.To the south, the Windy Fire grew to 19 square miles (50 square kilometers) on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into the Peyrone grove of sequoias and threatens others.The fire also had reached Long Meadow Grove, where two decades ago then-President Clinton signed a proclamation establishing its Trail of 100 Giant Sequoias as a national monument.Fire officials haven’t yet been able to determine how much damage was done to the groves, which are in remote and hard-to-reach areas. They said crews were “doing everything they can” to protect the trail by removing needles, leaves and other fuels from around the base of the trees.Last year, the Castle Fire killed an estimated 7,500 to 10,600 large sequoias, according to the National Park Service. That was an estimated 10% to 14% of all the sequoias in the world.The current fires are eating through tinder-dry timber, grass and brush.In far Northern California, an early season rain was a welcome sign for firefighters battling a cluster of wildfires ignited by lightning in the Klamath National Forest in late July. Fire officials say it won’t extinguish the nearly 300-square-mile (772 square-kilometer) blaze, but will help crews reach their goal.Light rain is expected in the coastal area north of San Francisco over the weekend, but forecasters say conditions are likely to dry out by early next week, prompting a fire weather watch that may lead to power shutoffs in Napa, Sonoma and Solano counties.Historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.More than 7,000 wildfires in California this year have damaged or destroyed more than 3,000 homes and other buildings and torched well over 3000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection."}, {"title": "Hundreds Of Migrating Birds Die After Crashing Into NYC Buildings", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Hundreds of birds migrating through New York City this week died after crashing into the city’s glass towers, a mass casualty event spotlighted by a New York City Audubon volunteer’s tweets showing the World Trade Center littered with bird carcasses.This week’s avian death toll was particularly high, but bird strikes on Manhattan skyscrapers are a persistent problem that NYC Audubon has documented for years, said Kaitlyn Parkins, the group’s associate director of conservation and science.Stormy weather Monday night into Tuesday contributed to the deaths, she said.“We had a big storm and sort of weird weather and lots of birds, and that’s sort of the perfect combination that can lead to bird-window collisions,” Parkins said.“It seems that the storm might have brought the birds in lower than they would have otherwise have been, or just disoriented them,” Parkins added. “The effects of nocturnal light on birds is also quite strong, especially when it’s a cloudy night.”Volunteers with NYC Audubon document bird deaths at high-risk spots during the spring and fall migrations.Melissa Breyer, the volunteer who tweeted about finding nearly 300 birds on sidewalks surrounding the new World Trade Center towers, said the experience was “overwhelming.”“As soon as I got to the buildings, the birds were everywhere on the sidewalk,” Breyer said. “Looking north, covered, south, covered, west, covered, the sidewalks were literally covered with birds.”NYC Audubon wants the owners of the World Trade Center towers and other buildings to help reduce the number of bird strikes by dimming the lights at night and by treating glass to make it more visible to birds.“Make it so that they can see it and recognize that it’s a solid barrier that they cannot fly through,” Parkins said.Jordan Barowitz, a spokesperson for the Durst Organization, co-developer of One World Trade Center, said in an email, “The first 200 feet of One WTC are encased in glass fins that are non-reflective. This design was chosen because it greatly reduces bird strikes which mostly occur below 200 feet and are frequently caused by reflective glass.”Dara McQuillan, a spokesperson for Silverstein Properties, the developer of three other trade center skyscrapers, said, “We care deeply for wild birds and protecting their habitat in the five boroughs. Understanding that artificial night-time lighting in general can attract and disorient migrating birds, we are actively encouraging our office tenants to turn off their lights at night and lower their blinds wherever possible, especially during the migratory season.”It wasn’t the last flight for all the birds that crashed. Some survived.A total of 77 birds were taken to the Wild Bird Fund’s rehab facility on the Upper West Side on Tuesday, the majority of them from the trade center area, director Ritamary McMahon said.“We knew it was going to be a large migration coming in. They could tell from the radar,” said McMahon, who scheduled extra staff to care for an expected influx of injured birds.The Wild Bird Fund staff members gave the birds food, fluids and anti-inflammatory medications to reduce swelling.Thirty birds recovered and were released in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park on Wednesday, McMahon said.“One of our staff took an Uber down to Prospect Park to release them so they wouldn’t face any more tall buildings on their travels,” she said."}, {"title": "Trump Moved A Public Land Agency's HQ Out West. Biden Is Moving It Back To DC.", "text": "The Biden administration will relocate the headquarters of the federal Bureau of Land Management back to Washington, D.C., as part of a broader effort to “rebuild and strengthen” the agency after years of “upheaval” under President Donald Trump, the Interior Department announced Friday.The Trump administration made a big to-do of moving BLM’s headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado, in 2019, arguing that the agency in charge of overseeing vast swaths of public lands should be based out west, where the majority of those federal acres are located. The move, which resulted in nearly 300 employees resigning or taking early retirement, was part of what many saw as an effort to force out federal workers.In fact, Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, as much as admitted it.Relocations are “a wonderful way to sort of streamline government,” Mulvaney said at a 2019 Republican gala in South Carolina, referring to the decision to uproot D.C.-based Agriculture Department employees and move them to the Kansas City area. “It’s really, really hard to drain the swamp, but we’re working at it.”The Bureau of Land Management oversees some 245 million acres of public land — more than 10% of the entire U.S. landmass, and one-third of all federal land — and 700 million subsurface mineral acres. Even before the Trump administration moved the agency’s headquarters, the vast majority of BLM staff were positioned in the West.Now, Interior has announced a sort of hybrid approach that will involve restoring BLM’s national headquarters to the nation’s capital while maintaining a “Western headquarters” in Grand Junction, in order to “reinforce western perspectives in decision-making.”“The Bureau of Land Management is critical to the nation’s efforts to address the climate crisis, expand public access to our public lands, and preserve our nation’s shared outdoor heritage,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday in a statement. “There’s no doubt that the BLM should have a leadership presence in Washington, D.C. ― like all the other land management agencies ― to ensure that it has access to the policy-, budget-, and decision-making levers to best carry out its mission. In addition, the BLM’s robust presence in Colorado and across the West will continue to grow.”Haaland traveled to Grand Junction in July, where she met with local, state and tribal leaders about the issue. Friday’s news prompted mixed reactions from Colorado lawmakers.“While I am disappointed that the national headquarters will be in Washington, I believe establishing and growing a permanent BLM Western Headquarters in Grand Junction should be a very positive development,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said in a statement.The Interior Department said Friday that BLM’s relocation failed to create the jobs the Trump administration promised. More than 87% of affected staff left the bureau following the Trump relocation announcement. Of the 41 employees who did move, only three landed in Grand Junction, according to Interior.Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said Haaland’s effort is a “first step in fixing the extensive damage the Trump administration wreaked on the Bureau of Land Management.”“It’s clear that moving the agency’s headquarters out of Washington, D.C. was meant to force out career employees and hollow out its leadership,” Rokala said in a statement. “The Bureau of Land Management oversees one-tenth of all lands in the United States, and the American people deserve an agency with a seat at the table when important decisions are being made in Washington. This move will help the agency rebuild and ensure that top Bureau of Land Management officials can bring their concerns directly to lawmakers, Interior Department leadership, and the White House.”"}, {"title": "All The Lions And Tigers At D.C.'s National Zoo Have Tested Positive For COVID-19", "text": "The lions and tigers at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., have tested positive for COVID-19.Six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers all received “presumptive positive” results for the coronavirus, the zoo announced in a Friday press release. That means the animals had positive laboratory test results, but they need to be confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But the big cats are also displaying symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, decreased appetite and lethargy, so zookeepers believe they are most likely infected.“Because the test results are presumptive positive and we are observing symptoms in the animals, we are treating all animals as positive,” zoo spokesperson Pamela Baker-Masson told DCist.It’s unclear how the lions and tigers got infected. The cats remain under “close observation” and are still able to access their outdoor areas, the zoo said. It noted in the press release that the animals pose no risk to the public because of the physical distance between them and visitors. (There’s also no evidence at this point that felines can pass COVID-19 to humans.)Testing was conducted via fecal samples, so no nose swabbing of the big cats was required.The lions and tigers are the latest in a long line of zoo residents to contract the coronavirus since the pandemic began. Other animals have included tigers and lions in New York City (all of them fully recovered), snow leopards in Kentucky and San Diego, and otters in Georgia, among others. And just last week, 19 gorillas at Georgia’s Zoo Atlanta tested positive and exhibited symptoms such as coughing and runny noses.Some zoos have begun inoculating animals using a vaccine called Zoetis, which was specially developed for animals. In March, the San Diego Zoo vaccinated several orangutans and bonobos. California’s Oakland Zoo began vaccinating big cats, bears, ferrets and primates in July.A lot of zoo animals are already trained to accept vaccines, since they need to get vaccinated against other diseases like rabies. That training can involve rewarding them after they get a shot. At the Oakland Zoo, for example, mountain lions were rewarded with goat milk, a chimpanzee received M&Ms and bears got to enjoy ice cream off a spoon, PBS reported."}, {"title": "Thai Taxi Drivers Idled By COVID-19 Lockdowns Turn Car Roofs Into Gardens", "text": "BANGKOK (AP) — Taxi fleets in Thailand are giving new meaning to the term “rooftop garden,” as they utilize the roofs of cabs idled by the coronavirus crisis to serve as small vegetable plots.Workers from two taxi cooperatives assembled the miniature gardens this week using black plastic garbage bags stretched across bamboo frames. On top, they added soil in which a variety of crops, including tomatoes, cucumbers and string beans, were planted.The result looks more like an eye-grabbing art installation than a car park, and that’s partly the point: to draw attention to the plight of taxi drivers and operators who have been badly hit by coronavirus lockdown measures.The Ratchapruk and Bovorn Taxi cooperatives now have just 500 cars left plying Bangkok’s streets, with 2,500 sitting idle at a number of city sites, according to 54-year-old executive Thapakorn Assawalertkul.With the capital’s streets deathly quiet until recently, there’s been too much competition for too few fares, resulting in a fall in drivers’ incomes. Many now can’t afford the daily payments on the vehicles, even after the charge was halved to 300 baht ($9.09), Thapakorn said. So they have walked away, leaving the cars in long, silent rows.Some drivers surrendered their cars and returned to their homes in rural areas when the pandemic first hit last year because they were so scared, he said. More gave up and returned their cars during the second wave.“Some left their cars at places like gas stations and called us to pick the cars up,” he recalled.With new surges of the virus this year, the cooperatives were “completely knocked out,” as thousands of cars were given up by their drivers, he said.Thailand’s new infections have ranged just under 15,000 in recent days after peaking above 23,400 in mid-August. The government hopes the country is easing out of this wave, which has been the deadliest so far, accounting for 97% of Thailand’s total cases and more than 99% of its deaths. In total, Thailand has confirmed 1.4 million cases and over 14,000 deaths.The situation has left the taxi companies in financial peril, struggling to repay loans on the purchase of their fleets. Ratchapruk and Bovorn cooperatives owe around 2 billion baht ($60.8 million), Thapakorn said. The government has so far not offered any direct financial support.“If we don’t have help soon, we will be in real trouble,” he told The Associated Press on Thursday.The taxi-top gardens don’t offer an alternative revenue stream. The cooperatives staff, who were asked to take salary cuts, are now taking turns tending the newly-made gardens.“The vegetable garden is both an act of protest and a way to feed my staff during this tough time,” said Thapakorn. “Thailand went through political turmoil for many years, and a great flood in 2011, but business was never this terrible.”——-Associated Press video journalist Tassanee Vejpongsa contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Fire Crews Wrap World’s Largest Tree In Fire-Resistant Blanket Amid California Wildfires", "text": "THREE RIVERS, Calif. (AP) — Firefighters wrapped the base of the world’s largest tree in a fire-resistant blanket as they tried to save a famous grove of gigantic old-growth sequoias from wildfires burning in California’s rugged Sierra Nevada.The colossal General Sherman Tree in Sequoia National Park’s Giant Forest, some other sequoias, the Giant Forest Museum and other buildings were wrapped for protection against the possibility of intense flames, fire spokeswoman Rebecca Paterson said.The aluminum wrapping can withstand intensive heat for short periods. Federal officials say they have been using the material for several years throughout the U.S. West to protect sensitive structures from flames. Near Lake Tahoe, some homes that were wrapped in protective material survived a recent wildfire while others nearby were destroyed.The Colony Fire, one of two burning in Sequoia National Park, was expected to reach the Giant Forest, a grove of 2,000 sequoias, at some point within days, fire officials said.However, the fire didn’t grow significantly Thursday as a layer of smoke reduced its spread in the morning, fire spokeswoman Katy Hooper said.It comes after a wildfire killed thousands of sequoias, some as tall as high-rises and thousands of years old, in the region last year.The General Sherman Tree is the largest in the world by volume, at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), according to the National Park Service. It towers 275 feet (84 meters) high and has a circumference of 103 feet (31 meters) at ground level.Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks Superintendent Clay Jordan stressed the importance of protecting the massive trees from high-intensity fire during a briefing for firefighters.A 50-year history of using prescribed burns — fires set on purpose to remove other types of trees and vegetation that would otherwise feed wildfires — in the parks’ sequoia groves was expected to help the giant trees survive by lessening the impact if flames reach them.A “robust fire history of prescribed fire in that area is reason for optimism,” Paterson said. “Hopefully, the Giant Forest will emerge from this unscathed.”Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires — fueled by climate change — can overwhelm the trees.That happened last year when the Castle Fire killed what studies estimate were 7,500 to 10,600 large sequoias, according to the National Park Service.A historic drought and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.A national interagency fire management team took command of efforts to fight the 11.5-square-mile (30-square-kilometer) Paradise Fire and the 3-square-mile (8-square-kilometer) Colony Fire, which was closest to the grove. Operations to burn away vegetation and other fuel that could feed the flames were done in that area.The fires forced the evacuation of the park this week, and parts of the town of Three Rivers outside the main entrance remained evacuated.To the south, a fire on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument grew significantly overnight to more than 6 square miles (15 square kilometers), and crews had no containment of it, a Sequoia National Forest statement said.The Windy Fire, also started by lightning, has burned into part of the Peyrone Sequoia Grove in the national monument, and other groves were threatened.“Due to inaccessible terrain, a preliminary assessment of the fire’s effects on giant sequoia trees within the grove will be difficult and may take days to complete,” the statement said.The fire led the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office to warn the communities of Ponderosa, Quaking Aspen, Johnsondale and Camp Whitsett, a Boy Scouts camp, to be ready to evacuate if necessary.The wildfires are among the latest in a long summer of blazes that have scorched nearly 3,550 square miles (9,195 square kilometers) in California, destroying hundreds of homes.Crews had limited ground access to the Colony Fire and the extreme steepness of the terrain around the Paradise Fire prevented it completely, requiring extensive aerial water and flame-retardant drops on both fires.

The oldest lobster fisher in the state and possibly the oldest one in the world, Oliver still faithfully tends to her traps off Rockland, Maine, with her 78-year-old son Max.Oliver started trapping lobsters at age 8, and these days she catches them using a boat that once belonged to her late husband and bears her own name, the “Virginia.” She said she has no intention to stop, but she is concerned about the health of Maine’s lobster population, which she said is subject to heavy fishing pressure these days.“I’ve done it all my life, so I might as well keep doing it,” Oliver said.The lobster industry has changed over the course of Oliver’s many decades on the water, and lobsters have grown from a working class food to a delicacy. The lobsters fetched 28 cents a pound on the docks when she first starting trapping them; now, it’s 15 times that. Wire traps have replaced her beloved old wooden ones, which these days are used as kitsch in seafood restaurants.Other aspects, though, are remarkably similar. She’s still loading pogeys — lobster-speak for menhaden, a small fish — into traps to lure the crustaceans in. And she’s still getting up long before dawn to get on the boat and do it.She was destined for this life, in some ways. Her father was a lobster dealer, starting around the turn of the century, and instilled a love of the business in Oliver, who would join him on trips.Wayne Gray, a family friend who lives nearby, said Oliver had a brief scare a couple of years ago when a crab snipped her finger and she had to get seven stitches. She never even considered hanging up her lobster traps, though.“The doctor admonished her, said ‘Why are you out there lobstering?’” Gray said. “She said, ‘Because I want to’.”After all these years, Oliver still gets excited about a lobster dinner of her own and typically fixes one for herself about once a week. And she has no plans to quit lobstering any time soon.“I like doing it, I like being along the water,” she said. “And so I’m going to keep on doing it just as long as I can. ”"}, {"title": "Sequoia National Park's Giant Trees At Risk As Wildfires Grow", "text": "SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) — Fire crews moved to ramp up the battle Wednesday against two expanding forest fires threatening Sequoia National Park’s giant sequoia trees and infrastructure.The Colony and Paradise fires, ignited by lightning strikes last week, covered about 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) in California’s steep Sierra Nevada.The Colony Fire was a threat to Giant Forest, home to more than 2,000 sequoias, but not imminently, said Mark Ruggiero, fire information officer for Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks.The fires are among the latest in a long summer of blazes that have scorched more than 3,500 square miles in California, destroying hundreds of homes.Sequoia National Park has been closed and its headquarters and resident employees have been evacuated, along with a portion of the community of Three Rivers outside the entrance.The park’s historic wooden entrance sign dating to 1935 was covered in fire-resistant wrapping, and hoses were in place at the headquarters area for structure protection.More than 300 firefighters were on the lines, aided by helicopters and air tankers when smoke conditions allowed. On Thursday, a national interagency management team will take over the fires, being managed collectively as the KNP complex, and even more resources are expected, Ruggiero said.A 50-year history of using prescribed burns to remove other types of trees and vegetation in the park’s sequoia groves was expected to help the giants survive by lessening the impact if flames reach them, Ruggiero said.Giant sequoias, some thousands of years old, live on the western flank of the Sierra. They are adapted to fire, which can help them to thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow.But Ruggiero noted that the extraordinary intensity of fires in current climate conditions can overwhelm sequoias, a scenario that played out when the 2020 Castle Fire killed many trees in the region.Studies estimate that 7,500 to 10,600 large sequoias were killed by that fire, along with many of other sizes, according to the National Park Service.The Colony Fire also poses a broader danger because it is burning at an elevation of the central Sierra where there are 280 million pines and other types of trees that have been killed by drought and bark beetles, Ruggiero said.“The Colony Fire specifically is burning in a really bad spot ... where these trees are like jackstraws and it’s difficult to put fire personnel into some of these areas because of that,” he said.Elsewhere, two California fires that have caused extensive destruction in the northern Sierra and southern Cascades were not growing.The state’s second-largest fire on record, the Dixie Fire, was 86% contained after burning 1,500 square miles in the northern Sierra and southern Cascades region. Near Lake Tahoe, containment of the 342-square-mile (885-square-kilometer) Caldor Fire increased to 71%.North of San Francisco, a 20-year-old Ukiah man was arrested Tuesday and jailed on suspicion of starting the Hopkins Fire in Mendocino County, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement. The fire that sparked Sunday north of Ukiah charred 257 acres destroyed homes and forced evacuations.—-Antczak reported from Los Angeles.

FWS announced Wednesday that its initial review found petitioners presented “substantial information that potential increases in human-caused mortality may pose a threat to the gray wolf in the western U.S.”“The Service also finds that new regulatory mechanisms in Idaho and Montana may be inadequate to address this threat,” the agency said in its release. The review is expected to take a year to complete.The pending decision promises to reignite longstanding tensions among the federal government, Western states and outside groups over who gets to manage gray wolves and how many the region should support.The gray wolf was largely eradicated from the mainland United States, largely due to government extermination campaigns waged on behalf of ranchers trying to reduce livestock losses. The federal government reintroduced them to the Northern Rockies in 1995.For years, they remained federally protected under the Endangered Species Act, and their resurgence is one of the landmark conservation law’s biggest success stories.But their recovery also set off years of legal wrangling as state governments sought the ability to manage them as any other non-protected species ― including controlling their numbers through hunting and trapping.Ultimately, states won that control. But hunting and trapping have not contained wolf numbers as efficiently as either state officials hoped or advocates feared. Instead, wildlife officials offered hunters and trappers more tags and extended seasons while wolf populations steadily grew.The state management plans enacted when Idaho and Montana took control over their wolves call for populations of 150 in each state. Idaho’s wolf population tops 1,500 in Idaho and 1,100 in Montana today.“Wolves are more than recovered in our state, reaching a population 10 times larger than what was required in the state recovery plan, and are now thriving in our ecosystems,” Chyla Wilson, a spokesperson for the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation, wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Due to the high success of wolf populations, Idaho is now able to manage them utilizing tools we already have in place in the state for other species, such as coyotes.”Exasperated Republican legislators, facing complaints from both ranchers and hunting outfitters worried about wolves’ toll on big game animals, tried to overstep the authority of state agencies by creating laws specifically to manage wolves. Idaho went furthest, letting hunters kill wolves at night or from motor vehicles, allowing contract killing for wolves and getting rid of the limit on wolf tags that an individual can buy.A group of 30 former wildlife officials wrote a letter in April criticizing the proposal for snatching wildlife management authority away from trained biologists and putting it the hands of politicians in the state legislature. Idaho Fish and Game Director Ed Schriever opposed the bill.Montana passed several more conservative laws with the same intent: squelching wolf numbers faster than state agencies seemed capable of without legislative prodding.Environmental groups celebrated Wednesday’s news, though it fell short of their hope to halt this year’s wolf hunts.“Anti-wolf policies in Idaho and Montana could wipe out wolves and erase decades of wolf recovery,” Andrea Zaccardi, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “We’re glad that federal officials have started a review, but wolves are under the gun now, so they need protection right away.”"}, {"title": "Why Some Activists Want To Postpone This Year’s Big Climate Summit", "text": "It’s one of the most tragic ironies of climate change: Poor countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America that have contributed the least amount of planet-warming gases to the atmosphere face the gravest threats of drought, extreme heat and chaotic storms in a changed climate.Now those same nations struggle to stock enough coronavirus vaccines to inoculate their populations against COVID-19 and its growing list of infectious variants. Many fear they won’t be able to attend the world’s most important climate summit, further stacking the deck in favor of the countries that grew rich burning coal and oil.Nearly 1,600 international nonprofits are calling on the United Nations to postpone November’s 26th Conference of the Parties, or COP26, until early next year, when more of the world’s population will be fully vaccinated against the deadly disease.The Climate Action Network, an alliance of more than 1,500 civil-society groups from 130 countries, warned last week that the vaccination and quarantine requirements for attending the in-person summit in Glasgow, Scotland, would “de facto exclude” many delegates, activists and journalists from outside the rich world.“There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the UN climate talks, between rich and poor nations, and this is now compounded by the health crisis,” Climate Action Network Executive Director Tasneem Essop said in a statement. “Looking at the current timeline for COP26, it is difficult to imagine there can be fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions and it should therefore be postponed.”The Climate, Land, Ambition and Rights Alliance, or CLARA, echoed the demand, noting that the eleventh-hour negotiations that ultimately secured the Paris Agreement at 2015’s conference relied on in-person huddle sessions that would be impossible to replicate over video meetings.“COP26 would only be legitimate if it were to be participatory, inclusive and safe, with equal conditions to participate for civil society from all countries. A virtual option or a hybrid alternative are barely inclusive,” said Patricia de Almeida Zuppi, a top adviser at the Brazilian conservation group Rede de Cooperação Amazônica, which is among CLARA’s roughly 40 organizations. “A fair and safe solution presupposes the postponement of COP26.”The British government, which is hosting this year’s conference, has rejected the calls but promised to cover the cost of the five-day quarantines it mandated for any attendees coming from its “red list” of countries with high infection rates.But even before the latest promise of financial aid, delegates in poor countries were already finding it difficult to access the help the British government offered.In June, the United Kingdom vowed to provide vaccines for all registered participants in the conference who had not already received one.In August, the U.K. took the additional step of creating a “red list” of dozens of countries whose citizens would need to quarantine for at least five days in a hotel upon arriving in the country for the conference.Yet by the start of September, “most campaigners from developing countries” had “heard nothing about how to get jabbed,” according to Chloé Farand of Climate Home News, who has extensively covered the issue. Citing interviews with delegates and campaigners from Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya, Pakistan, Argentina and Nicaragua, she reported: “As of 1 September, no vaccines had been delivered by the UK government and most of those who applied had heard nothing about if, when and how they would receive the jabs.”Aimé Mbuyi Kalombo, who is set to lead the Democratic Republic of Congo’s climate team in Glasgow, told Farand the mandatory quarantine would prevent “a number of people from the delegation” who focus on crucial climate finance issues from coming unless Britain covered the cost of the stay.Last week, Alok Sharma, the British Cabinet official in charge of COP26, said the world could not afford to further delay the conference, which was already postponed from last year as the pandemic raged and vaccinations were not yet available.“We are working tirelessly with all our partners, including the Scottish Government and the UN, to ensure an inclusive, accessible and safe summit in Glasgow with a comprehensive set of COVID mitigation measures,” he said in a statement. “This includes an offer from the UK Government to fund the required quarantine hotel stays for registered delegates arriving from red list areas and to vaccinate accredited delegates who would be unable otherwise to get vaccinated.”Yet some say that in making it harder for developing countries to attend the climate talks, the U.K. is giving itself an advantage.One of the priorities for negotiators is agreeing on rules for implementing the Paris Agreement’s Article 6, the last major piece of the global pact’s rulebook that wasn’t completed at the 2018 gathering. The little-known and highly technical provision in the global pact to cut carbon emissions would set up financial markets for trading carbon credits.“This is absolutely the U.K.’s No. 1 priority in the negotiations, getting Article 6 done, and in doing so ensuring a future in carbon derivatives trading for the City of London and the firms associated with that,” said Peter Riggs, director of the nonprofit Pivot Point and a coordinator for CLARA, referring to the name of the British capital’s banking and financial sector. “Was this a deliberate strategy? I don’t think so. But the countries that have been critical of the U.K., European Union and U.S. position on carbon trading are all on the red list.”The divisions, he said, run parallel to the divide over whether to waive patent rights for COVID-19 vaccines so that manufacturers could produce plentiful generic versions to be distributed in poorer countries. In that case, too, wealthier countries in Europe and North America prioritized pharmaceutical companies’ profits from the vaccines over increasing the immediate supply of the shots.“We have folks in our network that are completely outraged by the continued problem of vaccine apartheid,” Riggs said. “They understand the COP through that lens of inequitable participation. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.”"}, {"title": "Biden Throws Some Not-So-Subtle Shade At Trump Without Even Saying His Name", "text": "President Joe Biden drew laughs on Tuesday with a not-so-subtle jab at Donald Trump by referring to one of his most bizarre claims.Speaking in Colorado about the bipartisan infrastructure deal, Biden called for urgent action to address climate change.“We know what’s causing climate change: human activity. This is no longer subject to debate,” Biden said. “And I might add, windmills do not cause cancer.”Trump has a long history of attacking wind turbines, largely because he thought they spoiled the view from one of his golf resorts. He even unsuccessfully sued to stop them.In 2019, Trump famously claimed that the noise of windmills caused cancer. It does not.And earlier this year, he went even further.“They’re making windmills all over the place, to ruin our land and kill our birds,” Trump said. “To kill everything.”Windmills do not “kill everything” and the risk to birds has been overstated. According to the Sierra Club, far more birds are killed by communications towers, power lines, windows and cats than by windmills.“For the sake of birds, the environment and nature’s beauty wind and solar power are a vastly better choice than coal, oil and nuclear energy,” the group stated on its website.The Sierra Club also called for actions to reduce the number of bird deaths."}, {"title": "Trump Officials Used Secret Twitter Account To Rip Enemies (And Make Fart Jokes?)", "text": "Top officials at Donald Trump’s Interior Department were directly involved in a short-lived campaign to blast agency critics from an unclaimed troll Twitter account, according to internal documents HuffPost obtained.The Twitter handle @NoBullBison quietly appeared in April 2019 and began taking swings at the administration’s critics. “Bison bringing the facts - calling out the bull,” read the profile’s bio, a reference to the federal agency’s bison seal.Faith Vander Voort, the Interior Department’s top spokesperson, used her official government email account to set up the No Bull Bison account. She quickly chimed in: “I think this would make a fantastic first ‘No Bull from the Bison’ tweet.”Vander Voort drafted a series of tweets using Stemler’s email and forwarded them to Jorjani. After some confusion — “??,” Jorjani initially responded — he signed off on the thread.“Team,” Vander Voort wrote to colleagues in the secretary’s office. “Wanted to let you all know that I received the golden thumb of compliance from Dan (see below). Unless I hear otherwise from any of you before 4:30pm, I am going to let it rip from the Bison account.”“I’m good,” Willens responded approvingly, noting that a retweet from Bernhardt would be “likely.”Vander Voort subsequently emailed Bernhardt to ask if she could retweet the post from his account. The documents do not include any response from the secretary, but his official government Twitter handle did retweet it later that day.It wasn’t until the following day, April 19, and only after HuffPost revealed that the @NoBullBison profile was set up using Vander Voort’s government email address, that the Interior Department acknowledged the account as its own.As HuffPost previously reported, @NoBullBison’s run on social media was brief and insignificant. Over the six months it was active, it posted just five times and garnered little engagement.In its final tweet, the handle targeted then-Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress, for apparently misstating the number of federally recognized tribes in the U.S. during a congressional hearing. But instead of a fair, accurate fact-check, Trump Interior officials used their troll account to misrepresent Haaland’s words.In March, Haaland was confirmed as the 54th secretary of the Interior Department, the massive federal agency that oversees roughly one-fifth of all land in the U.S."}, {"title": "Tropical Storm Nicholas Hits Texas Coast With Heavy Rain, Strong Winds", "text": "HOUSTON (AP) — Tropical Storm Nicholas slowed to a crawl over the Houston area Tuesday after making landfall earlier as a hurricane, knocking out power to a half-million homes and businesses and dumping more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain along the same area swamped by Hurricane Harvey in 2017.Nicholas could potentially stall over storm-battered Louisiana and could bring life-threatening floods across the Deep South over the coming days, forecasters said.Nicholas made landfall early Tuesday on the eastern part of the Matagorda Peninsula and was soon downgraded to a tropical storm. It was about 10 miles (15 kilometers) southeast of Houston, Texas, with maximum winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as of 10 a.m. CDT Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.Galveston saw nearly 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain from Nicholas, the 14th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, while Houston reported more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain. That’s a fraction of what fell during Harvey, which dumped more than 60 inches (152 centimeters) of rain in southeast Texas over a four-day period.Nicholas is moving so slowly it will dump several inches of rain as it crawls over Texas and southern Louisiana, meteorologists said. This includes areas already struck by Hurricane Ida and devastated last year by Hurricane Laura. Parts of Louisiana are saturated with nowhere for the extra water to go, so it will flood, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.“It’s stuck in a weak steering environment,” McNoldy said Tuesday. So while the storm itself may weaken “that won’t stop the rain from happening. Whether it’s a tropical storm, tropical depression or post-tropical blob, it’ll still rain a lot and that’s not really good for that area.”The storm was moving north-northeast at 6 mph (9 kph) and the center of Nicholas was expected to move slowly over southeastern Texas on Tuesday and over southwestern Louisiana on Wednesday.Nicholas, expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday night, could dump up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain in parts of southern Louisiana. Forecasters said southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle could see heavy rainfall as well.Much of Texas’ coastline was under a tropical storm warning that included potential flash floods and urban flooding. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said authorities placed rescue teams and resources in the Houston area and along the coast.In Houston, officials worried that heavy rain could inundate streets and flood homes. Authorities deployed high-water rescue vehicles throughout the city and erected barricades at more than 40 locations that tend to flood, Mayor Sylvester Turner said Monday.“This city is very resilient. We know what we need to do. We know about preparing,” said Turner, referencing four major flood events that have hit the Houston area in recent years, including devastating damage from Harvey.Meteorologist Kent Prochazka of the National Weather Service told The Associated Press early Tuesday that Nicholas’ winds downed trees in coastal counties and caused some gas stations to lose awnings.“Right before it made landfall, it abruptly intensified into a hurricane and as it moved inland, the pressures began to rise with it. The winds have relaxed slightly and now we’re getting down into tropical storm force (winds),” he said.More than 500,000 homes and businesses were without power in Texas by midmorning Tuesday, according to the website poweroutage.us that tracks utility reports.Numerous school districts along the Texas Gulf Coast canceled classes Monday and Tuesday because of the storm. The weather threat also closed multiple COVID-19 testing and vaccination sites in the Houston and Corpus Christi areas and forced the cancellation of a Harry Styles concert scheduled for Monday evening in Houston.A tornado or two may be possible Tuesday along the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coast, according to the weather service.Nicholas brought rain to the same area of Texas that was hit hard by Harvey, which was blamed for at least 68 deaths, including 36 in the Houston area. After Harvey, voters approved the issuance of $2.5 billion in bonds to fund flood-control projects, including the widening of bayous. The 181 projects designed to mitigate damage from future storms are at different stages of completion.McNoldy, the hurricane researcher, said Nicholas is bringing far less rain than Harvey did.“It’s not crazy amounts of rain. It isn’t anything like Hurricane Harvey kind of thing with feet of rain,” McNoldy said. Harvey not only stalled for three days over the same area, it moved a bit back into the Gulf of Mexico, allowing it to recharge with more water. Nicholas won’t do that, McNoldy said.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Sunday night, ahead of the storm’s arrival in a state.On Monday, Misty Tran dreaded the thought of Nicholas reaching as far east as her home south of New Orleans in Empire, Louisiana. Ida damaged the roof of Tran’s mobile home. A tarp covers the roof now, Tran said, but it wouldn’t be a match for a even a weak storm.“A tarp can only do so much,” said Tran, helping clean up at a marina where she works.The storm was expected to bring the heaviest rainfall west of where Ida slammed into Louisiana two weeks ago. Ida has been blamed for 86 deaths throughout the United States. Across Louisiana, about 95,000 customers remained without power Tuesday morning, according to poweroutage.us.Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said via Twitter that only four other years since 1966 have had 14 or more named storms by Sept. 12: 2005, 2011, 2012 and 2020."}, {"title": "Scientists Potty Train Cows To Use ‘MooLoo’ -- No Bull", "text": "Turns out cows can be potty trained as easily as toddlers. Maybe easier.It’s no bull. Scientists put the task to the test and 11 out of 16 cows learned to use the “MooLoo” when they had to go.Just like some parents, the researchers used a sweet treat to coax the cows to push through a gate and urinate in a special pen. And it took only 15 days to train the young calves. Some kids take quite a bit longer.““The cows are at least as good as children, age 2 to 4 years, at least as quick,” said study senior author Lindsay Matthews, an animal behavioral scientist at New Zealand’s University of Auckland who worked with colleagues on the tests at an indoor animal research lab in Germany.What started with a half-in-jest question on a New Zealand radio talk show about the very real problem of livestock waste resulted in a serious study published Monday in the journal Current Biology. And it wasn’t just a “wow, this could be fun” academic question. Massive amounts of urine waste is a serious environmental issue, Matthews said.Urine contains nitrogen, and when mixed with feces becomes ammonia, which is an environmental issue with acid rain and other problems, Matthews said. It can also taint the water with nitrates and create the airborne pollutant nitrous oxide, he said.And cows do pee a lot. A single cow can produce about 8 gallons (30 liters) of urine a day, Matthews said. In 2019, nitrous oxide comprised 7% of all the U.S. greenhouse gases, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.“I am not surprised they can train calves to urinate in set locations, but I am surprised no one has demonstrated this before,” said Duke University animal cognition scientist Brian Hare, who wasn’t part of the research. “The critical question is can it and will it scale?If it could be done, toilet training animals makes it easier to manage waste products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said Donald Broom, a professor of animal welfare at the University of Cambridge in England.At the lab is Dummerstorf, Germany, the researchers mimicked a toddler’s training, putting the cows in the special pen, waiting until they urinated and then giving them a reward: a sweet liquid of mostly molasses. Cows do have a sweet tooth, Matthews said. If the cows urinated outside the MooLoo after the initial training, they got a squirt of cold water.Then in two sets of experiments, the researchers let the Holstein cows roam about the indoor facility. When they had to urinate, 11 of them pushed into the pen, did their business, and got their sweet reward.There are a couple caveats to this experiment.No. 1, they gave diuretics to the cattle to get them to urinate more because they had limited time to run the experiments under ethics guidelines.And No. 2, they didn’t do No. 2. They only trained cows to use the MooLoo to urinate, not defecate.Urine is a bigger problem, at least in Europe, Matthews said. But he predicted they could train cows to poop in a certain place too.While dogs, cats and horses can be toilet trained, they already show the desire to go in special places, but cows don’t, Matthews said.The biggest environmental problem for livestock, though, is the heat-trapping gas methane they emit in belches and flatulence, a significant source of global warming. The cows can’t be trained not to belch or fart, Matthews said: “They would blow up.”___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Marching bands parade down sunny small-town Main Streets carrying giant American flags as the stars and stripes flutter in the wind.The upbeat 30-second spot, set to start running Monday during the morning talk shows on CNN and MSNBC, is the first major ad campaign in support of the Clean Electricity Payment Plan, the key climate provision in Democrats’ $3.5 trillion spending bill. (Evergreen Action has no current plans to run the ad on Fox News.) It is scheduled to run for three weeks in the Washington, D.C., area.The six-figure ad buy ― Evergreen Action declined to share the full amount it planned to spend ― will run as lawmakers negotiate what is widely seen as the Biden administration’s best opportunity to make serious policy changes ahead of a midterm election in which Republicans are favored to win back power in Congress.The legislation aims to pay or fine utility companies to spur them into generating a larger share of power from zero-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear plants. If successful, the program would shrink fossil fuels’ share of the nation’s electricity production from roughly 60% today to less than 20% in 2030, unless those gas- or coal-fired units are equipped with working carbon capture technology.Such a shift would eliminate more than 1 billion tons per year of planet-heating pollution. The bill becoming law would mark the most significant and sturdy climate policy ever enacted in the United States, and give the world’s No. 2 emitter credibility at the United Nations’ highly anticipated global summit in Scotland this November.By 2031, the program would also create demand for nearly 7.7 million jobs that currently don’t exist and add about $1 trillion to the economy, according to a new analysis Evergreen Action and the Natural Resources Defense Council commissioned and released last week.The proposal is popular. Polls have repeatedly shown large majorities of voters across party lines support a federal program to hasten the transition away from fossil fuels this decade, including in swing states such as Arizona, Georgia and Montana.But ditching gas and coal as the country’s main electricity feedstocks would shrink profits for the powerful companies that produce and supply the fuels, and those industries’ allies have aggressively opposed the Clean Electricity Payment Plan. Just two weeks ago, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board lamented that the program would “prematurely shut down fossil-fuel plants.”Democrats, who are expecting lockstep Republican opposition to the program, hope to pass the bill as part of federal budget legislation, which requires just a simple majority and avoids the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster rule. That means Democrats need to rally every member of their narrow majorities in Congress.Last month, the League of Conservation Voters and the group Climate Power rolled out a $10 million ad campaign to boost Georgia Democrats that back the proposal.Now Evergreen Action wants to win over Democrats still on the fence.“We’re trying for every single Democratic member of Congress,” Jamal Raad, who co-founded Evergreen Action with fellow former staffers of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s climate-centered presidential campaign, told HuffPost. “This is a positive story on economic growth. It’s jobs. We need to go on the offense.”"}, {"title": "More Than 100 Birds Found Covered In Oil After Hurricane Ida Refinery Spill", "text": "More than 100 water birds have been found covered in oil in the wake of a spill at a Louisiana refinery damaged by Hurricane Ida.The birds have been located “within heavy pockets of crude oil” from the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery in Belle Chasse, and in flooded fields and retention ponds close by, according to a Thursday news release from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries.The “growing number” of affected birds has included multiple egret species, black-bellied whistling ducks and blue-winged teal, among other species. Alongside birds, some alligators, otters and nutria were found with oil on them.The mission to help the animals could take weeks, the department said. By Friday, 10 birds had been caught and brought to a wildlife rehabilitation center, state biologist Jon Wiebe told The Associated Press. Five dead birds had also been removed from the area.The AP had reported on the Alliance spill after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration captured aerial images showing a sheen of oil on the water. A levee protecting the refinery had failed during the storm, leading to a significant spill of heavy crude oil.Aerial photos also revealed an oil slick that grew to around 11 miles long in the Gulf of Mexico south of Port Fourchon, the result of a broken pipeline ― the owner of which is currently unclear. Those two spills are among more than 2,000 incidents of water pollution reported off Louisiana’s coasts or in its waterways after Ida, according to The Washington Post.The fossil fuels contaminating the environment and killing wildlife in the aftermath of the storm are also fueling extreme weather events like hurricanes and severe flooding.“There’s increasing evidence for an overintensification of the water cycle,” NASA scientist Alex Ruane told HuffPost last month. “Water is moving through the climate system faster than it used to. That means it is being evaporated into the air faster, it’s being moved around, and it’s raining down harder when it does rain.”"}, {"title": "Great White Shark Is Missing 'Unusual' Amount Of Teeth: 'Anyone Know A Good Dentist?'", "text": "If there’s a dentist out there willing to treat an apex predator underwater, have we got a gig for you.A recent cage-diving expedition around Mexico’s Guadalupe Island revealed a great white shark with a crazy amount of teeth missing.

Any indirect investments through private equity funds will be allowed to lapse.He stopped short of using the word “divestment” — the term environmentalist have touted for institutions that pull funds from carbon-emitting industries — but the shift amounted to a dramatic change in tack after years of school leadership refusing to even consider doing so.Harvard’s endowment is the largest of any university on earth, and fossil fuels currently make up about 2% of its total investments.“Given the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries to make long-term investment decisions that support our teaching and research mission, we do not believe such investments are prudent,” Bacow, who became president in 2018, wrote to the school community. “None of us will be spared the realities of climate change, which means we are all in this together. Global progress will depend on a collective effort to see one another not as adversaries but as partners, not as caricatures but as people.”Bacow himself had opposed divestment in 2019, The Harvard Crimson notes, but the school has taken other steps to address climate change. The fund that manages the endowment, the Harvard Management Co., had pledged to achieve net-zero emissions in its investments by 2050. The school on Thursday also appointed its first-ever vice provost for climate and sustainability.Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, a key group that for years urged the university to shift its investments, hailed the news, calling it a massive victory not just for the university community but also for “the climate movement, and the world.”“It took conversations and protests, meetings with administration, faculty/alumni votes, mass sit-ins and arrests, historic legal strategies, and storming football fields,” the group wrote on Twitter. “But today, we can see proof that activism works, plain and simple.”Divest Harvard said it would continue to press leadership to follow through on the pledge as quickly as possible.“This announcement is a massive victory for activists and for the planet,” the group said. “Much more work remains, of course — and our movement will be here to make sure that for Harvard, it’s only a beginning when it comes to building a more just and stable future.”"}, {"title": "Death Toll From Hurricane Ida Climbs To 26 In Louisiana", "text": "HOUMA, La. (AP) — The death toll in Louisiana from Hurricane Ida rose to 26 Wednesday, after health officials reported 11 additional deaths in New Orleans, mostly older people who perished from the heat. The announcement was grim news amid signs the city was returning to normal with almost fully restored power and a lifted nighttime curfew.While New Orleans was generally rebounding from the storm, hundreds of thousands of people outside the city remained without electricity and some of the hardest-hit areas still had no water. Across southeastern Louisiana, 250,000 students were unable to return to classrooms 10 days after Ida roared ashore with 150 mph winds.The latest deaths attributed to Ida happened between Aug. 30 and Monday, but were just confirmed as storm-related by the Orleans Parish coroner, the Louisiana Department of Health said in a statement. Nine of the New Orleans deaths — of people ages 64 to 79 — came from “excessive heat during an extended power outage,” while the two others were from carbon monoxide poisoning, the department said.More than a million people were left without power, including the entire city of New Orleans, when Ida struck on Aug. 29. The state’s largest power company, Entergy, said it expected to have electricity in the city restored to 90% by Wednesday evening.Meanwhile, the New Orleans Police Department and Mayor LaToya Cantrell lifted an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew they had imposed two days after the hurricane hit.Across New Orleans and southeastern Louisiana, families are still waiting to hear when their children can return to school, as districts assessed hurricane damage. Prior to Ida, schools around Louisiana had been open despite widespread cases of COVID-19, although under a statewide mask mandate for all indoor locations.“We need to get those kids back with us as soon as we possibly can,” said Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley.In New Orleans, School Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr. said damage to schools appeared to be mostly minimal, but power needs to be restored to all buildings, and teachers, staff and families need to return to the city to get schools up and running.“Now more than ever, our children stand to benefit from the comfort that structured and routine daily schooling can bring,” Lewis said in a statement Wednesday. “So, let’s all come together to reopen our schools quickly and safely.”Lewis said he expects classes for some will resume as early as next week and that all students will be back a week after that.No school reopening estimates have been provided for the five parishes that were hardest hit by Hurricane Ida and which are home to about 320,000 people: Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. James, St. Charles and St. John the Baptist. In those parishes, 96% of utility customers were still without power Wednesday.Bucket trucks and heavy power equipment were ubiquitous, but the task facing linemen remained daunting. Downed power poles and slack or snapped lines were still evident on long stretches of U.S. Highway 90 in St. Charles Parish. Heavy equipment trucks could be seen ferrying new poles to the area.Farther south, in the Terrebonne Parish city of Houma, trucks with linemen were on every street, and as the day progressed there were signs of progress: Traffic lights started flickering on, although sporadically, on busy Grand Caillou road by early afternoon.Linemen also were working south of Houma, in rural Terrebonne along Bayou Grand Caillou. But many of the homes were in no shape to connect. Coy Verdin was staying at his son’s house in Houma. The home the 52-year-old fisherman shares with his wife, Pamela, near the bayou was a soggy, smelly mess, all but destroyed in the storm.“All the ceilings fell. You can see daylight through the roof,” Verdin said. “All we have is basically a shell.”Ida scattered most of his 200 crab traps to parts unknown. “The only thing I have left is my boat and some of my commercial fishing rigging,” he said.The St. John the Baptist Parish School System website said all schools and offices will be closed “until further notification.” Lafourche Parish Schools Superintendent Jarod Martin indicated a “long and extensive road to recovery” on that school system’s website, with no timeline for a return in sight.“Until power is restored to our facilities and we’re able to obtain further information regarding damage to the infrastructure of our schools, we’re unable to provide an estimated date for a return to in-person learning,” the St. James Parish public school system said in an update posted Wednesday.Statewide, about 342,000 homes and businesses remained without power Wednesday, according to the Louisiana Public Service Commission.Access to fuel also remained difficult, with the website GasBuddy.com reporting about 48% of gas stations in Baton Rouge had no gasoline. About 56% of stations in New Orleans were also dry.About 44,000 people were still without running water in Louisiana, the state health department reported. That’s significantly lower than the hundreds of thousands of people who had no water immediately after Ida’s landfall. Still, more than 570,000 people were being told to boil their water for safety.In many neighborhoods, homes remain uninhabitable. About 3,200 people are in mass shelters around Louisiana while another 25,000 people whose houses have been damaged are staying in hotel rooms through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s transitional sheltering program.Louisiana’s secretary of state announced that fall elections will be pushed back by more than a month because of the storm.In addition to the death and destruction Ida caused in Louisiana, the storm’s remnants brought historic flooding, record rains and tornados from Virginia to Massachusetts, killing at least 50 more people.___Deslatte reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Benjamin died in captivity three years later and the Tasmanian tiger was declared extinct.Although the footage was originally shot on 35mm film, the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia hired an expert colorization team led by Samuel François-Steininger to spruce up the archival footage.The colorization was a challenge as just 3 minutes of total footage existed of the thylacine, all in black-and-white. François-Steininger relied on drawings, paintings and preserved thylacine pelts in museums to accurately color the footage.“For the thylacine, I faced a different kind of challenge and responsibility: I had to take care of the rare footage and pay tribute to the last representative of a species, which disappeared 85 years ago,” François-Steininger said in a statement this week.Rumors have persisted for decades in Australia of sightings of rogue thylacines, which are described as resembling a cross between a cat, a fox and a wolf. A marsupial, the creatures had a pouch in which they carried their young, akin to kangaroos and wallabies.Thylacines were once widespread on continental Australia but became extinct on the mainland about 2,000 years ago. It was later confined to Tasmania, where populations declined likely due to conflict with humans, the Australian Museum noted."}, {"title": "Platypuses To Be Reintroduced To Australia’s Oldest National Park After Half A Century", "text": "SYDNEY — Scientists in Australia are preparing to reintroduce platypuses to the country’s oldest national park after they disappeared from the area almost 50 years ago, embarking on an ambitious plan to preserve the duck-billed wonders.Platypuses haven’t been seen in the country’s Royal National Park, about 20 miles south of Sydney, in decades. But Gilad Bino, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales, said the project would see the egg-laying mammals return as early as next year, likening the park to Yellowstone in the United States in terms of its value to the Australian landscape.The effort, in conjunction with the WWF, Taronga Zoo and New South Wales government, is simple in theory: Bino and his colleagues are studying platypus breeding behaviors in southern New South Wales and will spend the latter half of 2021 surveying the Royal National Park to see if they can find suitable homes for the monotremes hidden in the thick forests of eucalyptus trees. Platypuses need deep pools of water to live in with high banks to build burrows.If researchers are able to find fitting ground for burrows and deep pools of freshwater full of food, they hope to capture about 10 from thriving platypus populations and reintroduce them into the park by late 2022. Scientists would monitor them for several years to see if they can adapt to the new environments, but Bino said such projects have been successful in other parts of Australia. Translocated platypuses have begun laying eggs and rearing broods of young, called puggles, a few years later.“We know that it’s possible,” he said, pointing to successful relocation projects in the states of Victoria and South Australia. “They can handle translocation, and if there are [these deep pool] refuges, they can handle drought and fires.”Finding platypuses, which are mostly active at twilight and during the night, is a daunting task even for a professional platypus researcher.“Sometimes it’s dumbfounding to think about the amount of effort we do for a single platypus,” Bino said, noting his team averages about two platypuses a night but that number is regularly closer to zero. “It’s usually at least two people, we set nets at dusk, we wait by the river all night.”But, he added, “when you do catch one, it’s gold.”His team will search for any potential platypuses in the Royal National Park as it surveys for potential new homes, and there have been anecdotal sightings over the last 15 or 20 years. But researchers will mostly be using DNA testing methods to see if any traces remain in waterways rather than hunting for the furry enigmas.It’s unclear why, exactly, platypuses disappeared from the Royal National Park. Some think a chemical spill in the 1980s on a roadway near the park may have killed populations off, or it may have been a series of droughts or poor water quality linked to coal mining.Decades later, platypuses face a spate of threats around the country akin to those endured by other iconic species, including the koala and the corals along the Great Barrier Reef.Invasive foxes and cats can prey on the platypuses, and the animals are particularly vulnerable to severe drought and bushfires that have plagued the country with increasing regularity as the climate warms.A study conducted last year by Bino and his colleague, Tahneal Hawke, found dramatic declines in platypus populations nationwide. Over the past 30 years, the pair found that platypus habitat had fallen by up to 22% in eastern Australia, where the animals are endemic, and the number of platypuses seen in parts of some urban areas near Melbourne had fallen by as much as 65%.Platypuses are listed as “near threatened” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, but Bino and Hawke have urged Australia to list them as threatened under the country’s conservation laws.“The platypus is seen nowhere else on the planet and like so many of our other iconic native species its future is uncertain,” Matt Kean, the New South Wales environment minister, said in a statement about the reintroduction plan. “Unfortunately, we have some of the worst extinction rates anywhere in the world and we have to make sure the platypus never makes that list.”Bino says the reintroduction plan is all part of a broader initiative to preserve platypuses for future generations. The plan could one day include captive breeding programs, rescue networks and efforts to find more habitats where they can be reintroduced.“The platypus is an iconic species, it’s a flagship species, it’s evolutionarily unique,” he said. “I want people to experience that, to think about platypuses when they go to the park and become passionate about nature.”"}, {"title": "Deadly Quake Hits Southern Mexico, Causing Buildings To Sway In Capital", "text": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake struck near the Pacific resort city of Acapulco on Tuesday night, killing at least one person and causing buildings to rock and sway in Mexico City hundreds of kilometers away.The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7 and was centered 17 kilometers (about 10 miles) northeast of Acapulco.Guerrero state Gov. Hector Astudillo told Milenio Television late Tuesday night that one person had been killed by a falling post in the town of Coyuca de Benitez near Acapulco.“We heard loud noise from the building, noise from the windows, things fell inside the house, the power went out,” said Sergio Flores, an Acapulco resident reached by phone. “We heard leaking water, the water went out of the pool and you heard people screaming, very nervous people.”Flores said all he could do when it started shaking was hug his wife. He saw people leaving hotels around the bay and some running into parking decks to remove their cars, fearing a collapse.“We were all worried about some change in the sea, but so far authorities have not said anything about a tsunami alert,” he said.Astudillo said the tsunami alert center had not registered any variations in the sea level. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later said the threat of potential waves had passed.The mayor of Acapulco, Adela Román, said in a statement to the television news outlet Milenio that “there is no really serious situation” so far and no reports of casualties.“There are nervous breakdowns; people are worried because there have been aftershocks,” she said, adding that there are “many gas leaks in many places” as well as some landslides and fallen walls.Before the first death was reported, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said via Twitter that authorities in the four states that most felt the earthquake told him there were no victims or serious damage beyond some collapsed walls and falling rocks.“Fortunately there is not serious damage,” he said.Mexico’s National Civil Defense said it was conducting reviews in 10 states, but had not received reports of victims nor serious damage.In Mexico City, more than 320 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away, the ground shook for nearly a minute in some parts of the capital, but the quake was less evident in other parts. Some people evacuated their buildings briefly, but most quickly went back inside on a rainy night.“I was at home with my mom and my dogs and the seismic alert started to sound,” said Claudia Guarneros, a makeup artist. “My mother was in another room and I started to call her. The house started moving and in the last part of the earthquake the power went out and we couldn’t see anything, we just saw some things falling.”Mexico City authorities said there were no early reports of significant damage in the city, though electricity was knocked out in some neighborhoods. Some broken windows in a downtown high rise covered the sidewalk in glass.Arturo Hernández stood outside the relatively new apartment building he moved into just three years ago. Beside it stood a taller building abandoned since the magnitude-7.1 earthquake of Sept. 19, 2017, in neighboring Puebla state that caused major damage in the capital.Hernández heard the seismic alarm and made it outside before the ground began to shake. The abandoned building next to his continued to crack and moan for three minutes after the shaking stopped, he said. Asked if he had worried about the damaged building next door, he said, “Always, always.”Tuesday’s earthquake occurred four years to the day after a magnitude-8.2 earthquake that struck off the coast of Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas, largely destroying the town of Juchitan in neighboring Oaxaca state and killing dozens."}, {"title": "Pope, Patriarch And Archbishop Of Canterbury Issue Climate Change Warning", "text": "ROME (AP) — The world’s top Christian leaders — Pope Francis, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians — on Tuesday issued a joint appeal for delegates at the upcoming U.N. climate summit to “listen to the cry of the Earth” and make sacrifices to save the planet.In their first-ever joint statement, the three Christian clerics said the coronavirus pandemic gave political leaders an unprecedented opportunity to rethink the global economy and make it more sustainable and socially just for the poor.“We must decide what kind of world we want to leave to future generations,” said the statement from Francis, Archbishop Justin Welby of the Anglican Communion and the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I.But in the statement, they also noted that the threat is no longer far off.“The extreme weather and natural disasters of recent months reveal afresh to us with great force and at great human cost that climate change is not only a future challenge, but an immediate and urgent matter of survival,” they said.The statement sought to give a sense of urgency to the upcoming U.N. climate summit, which Francis at least is expected to attend in person. The conference, known as COP26, is scheduled for early November in Glasgow, Scotland.“This is the first time that the three of us feel compelled to address together the urgency of environmental sustainability, its impact on persistent poverty, and the importance of global cooperation,” they wrote.Individuals have a role to play, but leaders bear the greatest responsibility to take courageous decisions in Glasgow, the statement said.“We say: choose people-centered profits; make short-term sacrifices to safeguard all our futures; become leaders in the transition to just and sustainable economies.”The statement was dated Sept. 1, when their churches celebrate the world day for the care of creation. There was no official explanation for why it was released a week late, though the Vatican is essentially closed for business in August, suggesting summer holidays might have been to blame.While the joint statement was a first, Francis has frequently cited Bartholomew’s teachings on the environment, including in his landmark 2015 environmental encyclical “Praised Be.” Welby, a former oil executive, has spoken out about the moral crisis of climate change though his Church of England has declined to divest fully from carbon-intensive companies arguing that it can force greater change on the fossil fuel industry as a shareholder."}, {"title": "Californians Coming Home After Fleeing Wildfire Now Face Bear Break-Ins", "text": "As thousands of South Lake Tahoe residents who fled California’s Caldor Fire were cleared to return to their homes this weekend, officials warned there may be an unexpected threat waiting for them: bears.“The delicate balance between humans and bears has been upset,” Sgt Simon Brown of the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office told reporters, per the Associated Press.With humans away for more than a week, the local bears became bolder, making more appearances in centrally located, urban neighborhoods than they usually do. In addition to humans being away, it’s possible that habitat and food source destruction from the wildfire may have compelled the bears to seek refuge in the urban areas, according to SFGate.The bears have been strewing garbage around and, in some cases, entering homes uninvited. South Lake Tahoe Police Chief Dave Stevenson told local news station KCRA that the department had gotten reports of 17 break-ins this week, and 15 of them turned out to be perpetrated by bears.Sgt. Brown told SFGate that it’s “not a crime” for bears to break into homes. And while law enforcement can’t “arrest” the animals, they will try to lure them away from homes, he said.Bear expert Toogee Sielsch has warned that returning residents should be cautious if they notice any indications a bear could have entered their home ― because the animal could still be inside.“When you come home and if you find that it looks like a window’s open or door’s open and something has accessed into your house, don’t rush in and definitely don’t block that spot,” Sielsch told KCRA. “It might be a wild animal that has made ingress into your house because that spot’s the only way they’re going to know to get out of your house.”Authorities lifted the mandatory evacuation orders for South Lake Tahoe and the surrounding areas on Sunday afternoon, downgrading them to a warning as firefighters managed to contain more of the Caldor Fire. Officials noted that the threat of the fire was not totally gone, and that the air remained smoky and especially hazardous to those with health issues.The rapid growth of the Caldor Fire, which began on Aug. 14, led to the U.S. Forest Service closing nearly all national forests in the state through Sept. 17. Multiple state parks around California have also been fully or partially closed in the wake of a dozen large fires burning across the state.Though wildfires have historically been a natural ― and even beneficial ― feature of the Western landscape, human-caused climate change and a legacy of counterproductive forest fire suppression have combined to create massive, deadlier and more destructive blazes. European settlers who colonized the U.S. and Canadian West largely implemented the practice of extinguishing wildfires ― rather than letting smaller, less intense fires run their course ― leading to a large buildup of flammable vegetation across the region. And a warming climate has led to significantly hotter and drier conditions in which big fires can ignite much more easily."}, {"title": "Treasured Western Trout Streams Wither Amid Heat, Drought", "text": "SARATOGA, Wyo. (AP) — The North Platte River in southern Wyoming has been so low in places lately that a toddler could easily wade across and thick mats of olive-green algae grow in the lazy current.Just over two years ago, workers stacked sandbags to protect homes and fishing cabins from raging brown floodwaters, the highest on record.Neither scene resembles the proper picture of a renowned trout fishing destination, one where anglers glide downstream in drift boats, flinging fly lures in hope of landing big brown and rainbow trout in the shadow of the Medicine Bow Mountains.But both torrent and trickle have afflicted storied trout streams in the American West in recent years amid the havoc of climate change, which has made the region hotter and drier and fueled severe weather events. Blistering heat waves and extended drought have raised water temperatures and imperiled fish species in several states.In the Rocky Mountains, the attention is on trout fishing, a big part of both the United States’ $1-billion-a-year fly fishing industry and the region’s over $100-billion-a-year outdoor recreation industry.“It seems the extremes are more extreme,” said Tom Wiersema, who’s fished the upper North Platte as a guide and trout enthusiast for almost half a century.Some years, Wiersema has been able to put in and float a section of river about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the Colorado line all summer. This year, Wiersema hasn’t bothered to float that stretch since late June, lest he have to drag a boat over wet, algae-covered rocks.“That’s what the river is at that point. Round, slippery bowling balls,” he said.In nearby Saratoga, population 1,600, leaping trout adorn light posts and the sign for Town Hall. The North Platte gurgles past a public hot spring called the Hobo Pool, and trout fishing, along with the fall elk hunt, are big business.Phil McGrath, owner of Hack’s Tackle & Outfitters on the river, said low flows haven’t hurt his business of guided fishing trips on drift boats, which launch from deeper water in town. The fishing has been excellent, he said.“You want to go easy on the little guys in the afternoon,” he urged a recent group of customers who asked where they could wet a line before a guided trip the next morning.It’s basic trout fishing ethics when temperatures get as high as they were that day, 85 degrees (29 Celsius), and water temperatures aren’t far enough behind.The problem: Water above 68 degrees (20 C) can be rough on trout caught not for dinner but sport — and release to fight another day. Low water warms up quickly in hot weather, and warm water carries less oxygen, stressing fish and making them less likely to survive catch-and-release fishing, especially when anglers don’t take several minutes to release fish gently.As air temperatures soared into the mid 80s and beyond this summer, Yellowstone National Park shut down stream and river fishing from 2 p.m. until sunrise for a month. Montana imposed similar “hoot owl” restrictions — so called because owls can be active early in the morning — on fabled trout rivers including the Madison flowing out of Yellowstone.Low, warm water prompted Colorado for a time to impose voluntary fishing restrictions on the Colorado River’s upper reaches — even as spasms of flash floods and mudslides choked the river and closed Interstate 70.In rivers like the upper North Platte, which flows north out of Colorado, low water runs not only warm but slow and clear, cultivating algae. Mats of algae can collect insects while offering trout shade and cover from predators, but they’re also a symptom of warm and stressful conditions, said Jeff Streeter, who guided on the upper North Platte before becoming a local representative for the fishing-oriented conservation group Trout Unlimited.“Where that threshold is, I’m not sure. I worry about it a little bit,” he said.Like Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming didn’t order anglers to stop fishing. Such an order was unlikely to have much benefit, Idaho officials decided.Wyoming’s rivers would be difficult to monitor for enforcing closures because temperatures fluctuate widely throughout the day and from riffle to hole, said David Zafft, fish management coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.Drought and heat — beneath skies smudged by wildfire smoke — also have varying effects from one big Western river to the next. Many are dammed, including the North Platte as it begins a 100-mile-wide (160-kilometer-wide), 180-degree loop through a series of reservoirs that serve farmers and ranchers in Wyoming and Nebraska.The largely predictable, cold flows out of Seminoe Reservoir make the North Platte’s “Miracle Mile” section just upstream of Pathfinder Reservoir a trout fishing paradise.Upstream of Seminoe, however, the river is more subject to the vagaries of nature. For trout fishing, mountain snows are at least as important as rain patterns in warmer months but expectations based on decades of snowpack records have come under doubt.“Things have changed too much and too rapidly,” said Zafft. “We are in the midst of figuring out how this climate is going to impact our snow, our runoff and temperatures. I don’t think we can really answer those questions yet.”Records going back to 1904 back up Wiersema’s suspicions about extremes on the upper North Platte.In 2011, high flows smashed all previous monthly averages for June and July. The 2019 flood was the worst by a more than 20% margin over the 1923 runner-up.Yet since 2000, the river has had eight of its lowest-flowing Augusts on record. They included the sixth-lowest in 2012, 12th lowest in 2018, and third-lowest in 2020.August 2021 verges on the 10 lowest on average. Mountain snow last winter and spring was about normal, but the ground was so dry from last year that much of this year’s melt soaked in without contributing to the flow.The pattern is becoming more common in the West, said David Gochis, a hydrometeorologist with the Boulder, Colorado-based National Center for Atmospheric Research.“A greater fraction of the snowpack, even if it’s an average snowpack year, is just going into replenishing the water in the landscape — in the shallow aquifer, in the soils — versus that water fully filling up the soils and then filling up the streams,” Gochis said.Yet no heavy rain might not be all bad for the river’s trout, given a massive 2020 wildfire that charred a vast area just east of the upper North Platte, in Medicine Bow National Forest.In July, a mudslide in a burn area just 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in Colorado killed three people and clogged the Cache la Poudre River with silt. That hasn’t happened on the North Platte, but the West’s ever-hotter wildfire seasons are a threat to trout populations, said Helen Neville, senior scientist with Trout Unlimited.“Fire is of course a natural process and something to which Western trout and salmon are well-adapted to, but the scale and intensity of recent fires may be pushing beyond their natural resilience in some cases,” Neville said by email.Climate change is especially worrisome for cutthroat trout, which unlike brown, rainbow and brook trout are native to the Rockies, according to Neville.What’s in store for the North Platte will depend on future rain, snow and melt patterns, not to mention ever-growing human demand for water. McGrath, the fly-fishing guide and tackle store owner, didn’t doubt climate change is at work and that it’s human caused. But he didn’t seem to be losing sleep over it.“If the world continues to get warmer, is trout fishing going to get worse? Yeah, of course. Trout is a cold-water animal, right?” said McGrath. “But is this going to happen tomorrow? No.”___Follow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver"}, {"title": "Inaction On Climate Change Is Greatest Threat To Health, 220 Medical Journals Warn", "text": "A coalition of more than 220 of the planet’s leading medical and public health journals issued an urgent rallying cry to address climate change on Sunday, saying the greatest threat to global health was the planet’s ongoing failure to rein in carbon emissions.The editors of the journals wrote the impassioned joint plea, warning humanity was already facing irreversible threats to public health just weeks before the United Nations is set to meet for its general assembly later this month. The threat was so urgent, they wrote, that countries can’t wait for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic to begin reducing emmissions.“Health is already being harmed by global temperature increases and the destruction of the natural world, a state of affairs health professionals have been bringing attention to for decades,” the call, published in journals including the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine and the British Medical Journal, reads. “The science is unequivocal: a global increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius [2.7 degrees Fahrenheit] above the pre-industrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.”The publication comes shortly after Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 monster, packing 150 mph winds and causing widespread havoc from the South to the Northeastern United States. Scientists have long said that climate change will increasingly spark more intense and more regular extreme weather events, including storms like Ida as well as severe drought, rampant flooding and unprecedented rainfall.A study published in May found more than a third of heat-related deaths in many parts of the world can be linked to warming made worse by climate change and others have warned of dramatic changes to the environment, mass extinction and conflict linked to the phenomenon.The editorial also follows a report issued in August by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found temperature warming thresholds of 2 degrees Celsius — the point at which scientists say the planet must remain beneath — would soon be “beyond reach“ without dramatic and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. UN Secretary General António Guterres said at the time the report was a “code red for humanity,” urging countries to act decisively to avoid the worst climate-related effects.The journals said Sunday the consequences of failing to act would fall disproportionately on many communities and countries that have contributed the least to create them, although the editors wrote no country would be shielded from a warmer world.“The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5° C and to restore nature,” the journals wrote on Sunday. “Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world.”"}, {"title": "Divers Find Source Of Oil Leak In Gulf Of Mexico After Hurricane Ida", "text": "A team of divers appeared to find the source of an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday after a miles-long oil slick appeared in the wake of the mammoth Hurricane Ida.Divers found oil leaking from a foot-wide pipeline along the ocean floor after Talos Energy, a Houston-based energy company, paid for a private team to investigate the leak. The pipeline does not belong to Talos Energy, the company said, adding that it is working with the U.S. Coast Guard to investigate the incident.Talos said two smaller pipelines were found in the area that were open and seemingly abandoned, although it’s unclear if oil had leaked from them.The Associated Press first reported last week that aerial photos showed a wide oil slick on the surface of the water about 2 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The slick appeared to stretch at least 12 miles and clean-up crews rushed to the area to try and figure out where the oil was coming from.The spill appears to have stayed out at sea and has not yet washed ashore. It’s unclear how much oil may have leaked from the pipeline and if it threatens any wildlife. Talos told the AP in a statement that new oil on the surface had diminished over the past two days and there was no heavy crude seen during the past 24 hours.The broken pipe is in shallow water, the AP notes, sitting about 34 feet below the surface.Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana last week as a Category 4 monster, packing 150 mph winds and causing widespread destruction across the state before it moved inland. Dozens of deaths have been linked to the storm, including many in New York, New Jersey and other northeastern states that suffered under torrential rain, flooding and tornadoes.The Gulf of Mexico is home to many oil and gas drilling projects. The Biden administration said this month that it would open millions of acres to further exploration in compliance with a court order mandating the government do so.The auction will encompass some 80 million acres of water along the Gulf of Mexico, and the sale of leases could result in more than 1.1 billion barrels of crude oil production, Reuters notes."}, {"title": "Toxic Algae Shuts Down California River Area Near Where Hiking Family Died", "text": "Federal officials have shut down access along nearly 28 miles of a California river contaminated with toxic algae in the wake of the recent mysterious deaths of a family found nearby.John Gerrish and Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and Oski, the family’s golden retriever, were found dead on a remote hiking trail along the Merced River in the Sierra National Forest last month after a family friend reported them missing.There were no signs of trauma or obvious causes of death, and autopsy toxicology tests are still pending.But after receiving test results of high levels of toxic algae water samples downstream from where the family was found, the Bureau of Land Management on Friday blocked access to campgrounds and recreation areas along the lengthy section of river.Signs warning about toxic algae were already posted along the Merced River when the family died.“The public must not enter the closure area. All uses within the closure area are prohibited,” stated the BLM order.“The safety of visitors to our BLM-managed public lands is a top priority,” BLM field manager Elizabeth Meyer-Shields said in a statement. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick.”Officials will “continue to monitor the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River,” she added.The area will be closed at least until Sept. 17.After the family’s bodies were found, the area was treated as a hazmat site and blocked off due to concerns about possible toxic gasses from an old mine in the area. But that was later discounted as a possible cause of death."}, {"title": "'Climate Change Is Expensive': Ida Destruction Reveals Astounding Infrastructure Needs", "text": "Deadly flooding delivered to the Northeast by the torrential rains of what remained of Hurricane Ida has brought a new urgency and a fresh look to how roads, sewers, bridges and other infrastructure must be improved to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again.The world is changing and “our whole mindset, the playbook that we use,” must change too, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday as he toured Mullica Hills, New Jersey, where a 150-mph (241 kph) tornado splintered homes. “We have got to leap forward and get out ahead of this.”The devastation exposed flaws in preparation plans even after New Jersey and New York spent billions of dollars to prevent a reoccurrence of Superstorm Sandy’s destruction in 2012, with much spent to protect coastal communities.“Flash floods are now coming. It’s not waves off the ocean or the sound,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said soon after last week’s storm swept through.Hochul and Murphy, both Democrats, agreed that the increasing frequency and intensity of storms demand a new approach that factors in flash floods.The storm dumped so much rain so fast that a record 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) fell in an hour in New York Wednesday, overwhelming drainage systems. Some lives were lost when water flooded basement apartments, subway stations and vehicles. At least 50 people died in five northeastern states.“I don’t think many people could have predicted the severity of the loss of life and damage done by the flash rains,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “People drowning in their basement apartments, in cars and so on is not something we typically would ever see in New York.”Hochul promised new answers to pressing questions, like whether warnings were clear enough and communications with the weather service were flawed as well as if subways needed a faster shutdown.The effects of climate change are “happening right now,” Hochul said. “It is not a future threat.”Warnings of worsening storm damage are not new.In August 2011, the aftermath of Hurricane Irene killed six in Vermont, left thousands homeless, and damaged or destroyed over 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway. Of the state’s 251 towns, 225 had infrastructure damage. Thirteen communities were severed from the outside world after flooding washed out roads, electricity and telephone communication. National Guard helicopters ferried supplies to stranded residents for days.More than half a billion dollars was spent by the state and federal governments, and in donations by private individuals, to help Vermont recover.To weaken effects of future storms, New York and other areas can learn from other cities like Singapore, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, where solutions included turning asphalt parking lots and schoolyards into spaces that can retain water, said Amy Chester, managing director for the nonprofit Rebuild by Design.“Climate change is expensive. We’re going to have to spend money on it and every single dollar we spend in any type of infrastructure needs to take into consideration the future,” she said.Redlener, the disaster preparedness expert, said New York City and other communities need to rethink warning systems and consider reengineering drainage, electrical and storm warning systems.He noted that the city’s aging subway system has long been relied upon to absorb excess water from heavy rains, but that was before record rainfalls set off unprecedented flooding.“That can’t work because there’s people in the subways and we have to think about their safety also,” he said.And he said the future of New York City’s basement apartments, which could number in the thousands, must be reconsidered.“What are we going to do for them now and what are we gonna do for people in the future? Are we going to even permit people legally to live in basement apartments, and if not, do we have the capacity and the resources to have other alternatives? I don’t know that we do,” he said.The system for warning people in areas threatened must be rethought and plans should be in place for what people should do and where they should go, he said.Linda Shi, an assistant professor in the department of city and regional planning at Cornell University, said there are limits to what infrastructure improvements such as larger storm pipes and road elevation can bring.She said most planners agree the strategies only buy time.If the worsening storm trends continue, she said, ultimately there will be increased conversations about “managed retreat.”“If you want to make space for water, that means making space for water by moving people out of those places,” Shi said.____Associated Press reporters Larry Neumeister in New York City, Wayne Parry in Piscataway, New Jersey, and Michael Hill in Albany, New York, contributed to this story."}, {"title": "Did 'Warning Fatigue' Set In As Hurricane Remnants Neared The Northeast?", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Cellphones across New York and New Jersey pulsed with urgent warnings of catastrophic flooding as the fury of Hurricane Ida’s remnants, carrying torrential rains, approached upper New Jersey and New York City on Wednesday.The first alerts of severe weather blared across millions of phones at 8:41 p.m. that night when the National Weather Service warned of dangerous flash flooding from the looming storm. Officials would issue three more alerts, late into the night, urging people to immediately head for higher ground and to stay out of rising floodwaters.A barrage of other alerts from a litany of apps lit up phone screens throughout the night — prompting some to wonder if people were just too inundated with information to take the threat seriously.Experts call it “warning fatigue,” and no one can be sure what role it might have played in a tragedy that killed scores of people across the Northeast, including more than two dozen in New Jersey and at least 11 in New York City — many drowning in their basement apartments or in cars trapped in submerged roadways.The weather service acknowledged that in the past, alerts were being pushed out too often. There’s been lots of handwringing over how to get more people to heed warnings.“It’s either they don’t believe the information that they’re hearing — they can’t verify it — or there’s some other reason that is completely out of anybody’s control,” said Ross Dickman, the meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service in New York.“It’s up to that individual,” he said, “but I think we need to do more work in understanding why people make the decisions that they do when they receive information and help get them to understand the impacts.”In some cases, people tried to flee too late and became trapped by floodwaters gushing so quickly, and with such force, that they could not open their doors to escape. Others might not have fathomed that flash flooding could also transform roadways into raging, impassable streams.Last year, the federal weather service revamped its criteria for issuing alerts, mindful that it might have been overusing the Wireless Emergency Alert system, which first went into operation in 2012 and now broadcasts urgent warnings to more than 300 million cellular devices.The weather service established a three-tier system in which alerts would only be sent out for the most severe flooding. Wednesday was the first time it issued an alert for the most catastrophic level for flash floods in New York and New Jersey, Dickman said.The ubiquity of cellphones makes the devices a key tool for urgently informing the public of dangerous weather, including hurricanes and tornadoes. It’s also used for Amber Alerts to enlist the public to help locate missing children. Authorities have also used cellphone alerts to help authorities nab dangerous people, including a terrorist who set off a bomb four years ago in New York City’s Chelsea district.New York City now has a million people subscribed to its wireless alert system that informs of a host of developments, including flooding but also disruptions in subway and other city services.“People drowning in their basement apartments, in cars and so on is not something we typically would ever see in New York, ”said Irwin Redlener, a founding director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University who says officials have to have plans to accompany warnings.“So if we have warnings that we’re going to see very severe, rapid rainfall with flash flooding,” he said, “what is it that we actually want people to do? Other than advise people it’s going to happen, do we want them to go to shelters? If so, do we have shelters for them to go?”The city’s alert system, Notify NYC, launched as Hurricane Sandy approached nine years ago. The storm killed dozens in New York City and caused massive flooding.“We do put a lot of thought into when we push that button — and we know the weather service does, as well — because we don’t want to over warn and we want people to take our warning seriously when we when we’re issuing messaging,” said Benjamin Krakauer, an adviser to the Office of Emergency Management commissioner.James Mielke, a video game designer who lives in downtown Manhattan, found the alerts more aggravating than useful.“They sound like somebody just blew a soccer horn in your ear,” Mielke said.“It actually got to the point where I Googled it and figured out how to turn off those alerts so I could just, you know, not have a heart attack every time the big siren went off on my phone,” Mielke said, adding that he thought he had turned off all the emergency alerts on his phone after Tropical Storm Henri blew through two weeks ago.“This time they weren’t as bad, but a few still got through,” he said.Henri brought lots of rain and fury but very little loss of life. That might have prompted complacency, said Jeannette Sutton, a disaster and risk expert specializing in communication at the University of Albany.“So they got a message last week that said it’s really really bad and then nothing happened. And then this week they get a message that’s really really bad — do they take it seriously?” Sutton asked.That’s a question on the minds of weather and public safety officials, she said, adding that the seemingly simple act of pushing out alerts is actually complicated.“We have been thinking about alerts and warnings since the 1950s, and how to increase their effectiveness, and thinking about how to help people make really good decisions when they’re faced with life-threatening situations,” she said.Associated Press writer Michael R. Sisak contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Mutual Aid Becomes Crucial Part Of Hurricane Ida Recovery", "text": "The day after Hurricane Ida struck Louisiana, Delaney Nolan spent hours biking around New Orleans, handing out money to people who needed to pay for supplies or for the hotel rooms where they’d taken shelter.Once the cash ran out — banks were closed, and ATMs were empty or no longer running without electricity — Nolan Venmo’d people the money they needed. As an organizer for the mutual aid group Southern Solidarity in Louisiana, she and her team also handed out free meals from restaurants that were cooking up their food stockpiles before they spoiled.Nolan is among the faces of philanthropy that are tending to the immediate personal losses inflicted by the hurricane. Mutual aid networks like Southern Solidarity spring into action to supplement the more established relief services from federal and local governments, as well as larger charities.The networks, in which community members pool resources and distribute donations to care for one another, seek to avoid the traditional charity model of giver and receiver. They grew in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as communities across the country faced dire needs. And now they are mobilizing in the wake of other disasters like Hurricane Ida.“Mutual aid is the most effective help right now,” Nolan said. “It’s built on communications with a lot of neighbors and existing relationships, from personally knowing what people need.”Established philanthropic groups are joining to support the mutual aid groups, too. Jasmine Araujo, the founder of Southern Solidarity, said that days after the hurricane hit, the organization GlobalGiving had called her and said there would be donations coming to her group quickly.“Most of our funds, though, come from individual donors,” she said. “We don’t usually get a lot of grants from bigger groups right away.”GlobalGiving launched its Hurricane Ida Relief Fund over the weekend to speed distribution of funds for those in need, said Donna Callejon, who leads the group’s disaster response effort.“The funds come in, and we mobilize quickly,” said Callejon, adding that because GlobalGiving has worked in the area for years, it has a list of partners that have already been vetted to receive funds. “We have experience working in Louisiana with a lot of historically disenfranchised groups.”Another Gulf is Possible, a collective of 11 organizers and artists based in Louisiana, Texas and Florida had stored up 30 kits of solar panels, batteries, lanterns, power banks, iPads and water filters in preparation for the storm. They are gearing up to distribute the items to community organizers in New Orleans and the predominantly Native American communities of Grand Bayou and Grand Bois. But reaching people in some areas has been difficult because of the power outages, said Bryan Parras, a member of the group.“People need everything,” said Anne White Hat, a Louisiana resident who’s part of the group, which has been collecting masks, googles, and gloves to protect communities from mold or lead during clean-up efforts.Mutual aid efforts “allow everyone, no matter their status, to contribute what they are able,” said Tanya Gulliver-Garcia, a director at the Washington-based Center for Disaster Philanthropy. “The pandemic showed us that even in a cash-dependent society, people and their ‘stuff’ are still a valuable resource.”Most of the nation’s 800 formal mutual aid groups formed during the pandemic, according to the group Mutual Aid Hub. Community fridges, for example, have sprung up in many cities since last year, allowing anyone to donate and take food.Members of Mutual Aid Disaster Relief, another group, have been circulating an online form where people sign up to help remove trees, share meals, host spaces for donation collections, provide counseling and perform other services for those impacted by Ida. About 90 new people have signed up to contribute in the past few days, a regional coordinator estimates.Help has also come from grassroots rescue groups. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Paul Middendorf, a volunteer disaster responder from Houston, traveled across hard-hit LaPlace, driving home to home in a high-water vehicle in an effort to rescue Louisianans from chest-deep floodwater.Most of those rescued were in shock, Middendorf said, with some stationing themselves in their attics, fearful of rising waters and with nowhere to go. Many sought help from CrowdSource Rescue, a Houston-based disaster response group that connects people seeking help with trained volunteers. Along with Middendorf, it has aided dozens of other volunteers do rescues or wellness checks during the disaster response.By the time Middendorf arrived at the homes, most of the floodwaters had receded. But some residents still feared leaving their attics. “A couple of the families, I literally coaxed down the attic as the waters receded,” Middendorf said.CrowdSource Rescue, which launched in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, directs people seeking help to call 911 before contacting them. The group says it provides assistance when local officials are overwhelmed with requests. Matthew C. Marchetti, the group’s executive director, says its average donation size is $60. So far, Marchetti says he’s confirmed that the volunteers have rescued 364 people from floodwaters using boats and high-water vehicles.Volunteers connected with CrowdSource had been fielding requests for help since Ida made landfall, but the fierce winds had initially made it impossible for them to respond. Middendorf, of Houston, rode out the storm at a parking lot in Baton Rouge, before heading 56 miles (90 km) southwest to LaPlace, where he found many trapped by floodwaters. Requests for help also came in for Lafitte, another town that suffered major flood damage.Despite coordination efforts amongst different rescue groups, Marchetti says there were overlaps in responses. Similar concerned pleas for help had flooded into Cajun Navy Relief, a group of Louisiana volunteers who help with search and rescue after hurricanes and floods.Owen Belknap, a student at Louisiana Tech University who leads one of the rescue teams, said his team managed to rescue one person in Laffitte. Belknap and his friends, also volunteers with Cajun Navy, began helping with disasters three years ago when a tornado swept through their hometown of Ruston, Louisiana. They joined the Cajun Navy last year as Hurricane Laura pummeled southwest Louisiana, killing 27 people.Once a business major, Belknap transitioned to studying nursing as he grew more passionate about rescue efforts. With a few more days before the school year begins, he has time, he said, to help cut knocked-down trees and distribute supplies to the affected communities.Amid the devastation, institutional funders have also opened their pocketbooks. Among them, the family foundation of Arthur M. Blank, the co-founder of The Home Depot and owner of the Atlanta Falcons, has pledged $500,000 each to a community foundation in New Orleans and The American Red Cross, whose volunteers are on the ground working on recovery efforts. Verizon’s company foundation has said it’s donating $100,000 to the Baton Rouge-based Foundation for Louisiana to aid those impacted by Ida.“My inbox is really full right now with queries from the funder community asking where to really pitch in,” said Regine Webster, the vice president of Center for Disaster Philanthropy.The Associated Press receives support from the Lilly Endowment for coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits.

The company is estimating full power restoration by Sept. 29 or even longer for some customers, although May said that was a “no later than” date with the hope of earlier restoration.As of Saturday morning, 97% of damage assessment was complete and power restored to about 282,000 customers from the peak of 902,000 who lost power after Ida. About a quarter of New Orleans residents have had power restored, including all the city’s hospitals, and the city’s 27 substations are ready to serve customers, said Deanna Rodriguez, Entergy New Orleans president and CEO.Six days after Hurricane Ida made landfall, hard-hit parts of Louisiana were still struggling to restore any sense of normalcy. Even around New Orleans, a continued lack of power for most residents made a sultry stretch of summer hard to bear and added to woes in the aftermath of Ida. Louisiana authorities searched Friday for a man they said shot another man to death after they both waited in a long line to fill up at a gas station in suburban New Orleans.New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the city would offer transportation starting Saturday to any resident looking to leave the city and get to a public shelter. It already began moving some residents out of senior homes.At the Renaissance Place senior home Friday, dozens of residents lined up to get on minibuses equipped with wheelchair lifts after city officials said they determined conditions at the facility were not safe and evacuated it.But Cantrell also encouraged residents to return to the city as their power comes back, saying they could help the relief effort by taking in neighbors and family who were still in the dark. Only a small number of city residents had power back by Friday though almost all electricity should return by Wednesday, according to Entergy.The outlook was not as promising south and west of the city, where Ida’s fury fully struck. The sheriff’s office in Lafourche Parish cautioned returning residents about the difficult situation that awaited them — no power, no running water, little cellphone service and almost no gasoline.Some parishes outside New Orleans were battered for hours by winds of 100 mph (160 kph) or more.President Joe Biden arrived Friday to survey the damage in some of those spots, touring a neighborhood in LaPlace, a community between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain that suffered catastrophic wind and water damage that sheared off roofs and flooded homes.The president has also promised full federal support to the Northeast, where Ida’s remnants dumped record-breaking rain and killed at least 50 people from Virginia to Connecticut.At least 14 deaths were blamed on the storm in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, including those of three nursing home residents who were evacuated along with hundreds of other seniors to a warehouse in Louisiana ahead of the hurricane. State health officials have launched an investigation into those deaths and a fourth one at the warehouse facility in Tangipahoa Parish, where they say conditions became unhealthy and unsafe.The health department on Friday reported an additional death — a 59-year-old man who was poisoned by carbon monoxide from a generator that was believed to be running inside his home. Several deaths in the aftermath of the storm have been blamed on carbon monoxide poisoning, which can happen if generators are run improperly.Deslatte reported from Baton Rouge and Santana reported from Marrero.

While others tried to deescalate the situation, the minivan driver fetched a gun from his car and shot Nosacka once in the chest before fleeing the scene.As Nosacka lay dying on the pavement, some people continued to collect fuel, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto told local reporters on Friday, saying, “Obviously, there were a lot of witnesses.”The department announced Saturday it had arrested 20-year-old Walter Sippio, a New Orleans resident, on one count of second-degree murder.“It’s unbelievable that people can’t act like adults in this situation,” the sheriff said in frustration.“Ladies and gentlemen, the services aren’t here,” he continued. “We don’t have enough gas on. We don’t have enough gas being delivered to service stations, we don’t have enough generators on, the lines are long, everybody’s out of control ― but for someone to lose their life over getting gas is absolutely ridiculous.”“If you’re out of town, stay out of town for a couple of days,” Lopinto said, adding, “It’ll get better. It will.”Louisiana has struggled to procure enough fuel to power recovery efforts after being walloped by Hurricane Ida earlier this week, resulting in stubbornly long lines during a heat wave that has sent temperatures into the 90s. Many residents have been relying on gas-powered generators to get through power outages caused by the storm; nearly 900,000 people were still without power across Louisiana as of Thursday.There have been reports of shouting and arguments breaking out at gas stations in the New Orleans area as some people filled multiple containers with gas and others allegedly cut in front. Lopinto said he has been sending deputies out “from place to place to place” responding to such disturbances.“Hostilities are high around here. For anybody to bring a gun to a gas station ― it’s not needed,” Lopinto said. “I have no doubt that we’re going to solve this crime, but nobody needed to lose their life over frickin’ gas today, and that’s what it comes down to.”Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards acknowledged this week that the fuel shortage “is impacting all of our recovery efforts.”A majority of gas stations in major metropolitan areas ― Baton Rouge, Lafayette and New Orleans included ― were still out of gas as of Saturday, according to GasBuddy, which tracks fuel usage.President Joe Biden directed Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Thursday to “use all of the tools at her disposal, including using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to keep gas flowing to the pumps” amid hurricane relief efforts.

The capybara, a South American animal that’s frequently the star of viral videos and memes, is the world’s largest rodent.Ongoing disharmony between the two has been documented in multiple stories by Argentine newspaper La Nacion and picked up by numerous English-language news outlets.Over the past few weeks, herds of capybaras, known in the region as carpinchos, have been clashing with Nordelta’s human residents. The big herbivores have reportedly been ripping up lawns, pooping all over, causing traffic jams, and in some cases biting pet dogs.The interspecies tensions have ratcheted up as the complex has continued to expand into the animals’ natural habitat.“Carpinchos were always here,” Nordelta resident Perla Paggi told Agence France-Presse. “We always saw them from time to time. But three or four months ago [builders] went for their last remaining stronghold and the stampede began.”Additionally, the capybaras now have few predators around, as carnivores like jaguars, pumas and wild dogs have become much more scarce as a result of human activity.Due to the circumstances, the capybaras have many defenders and even outright fans.“It’s not an invasion,” Argentine Ariel Fernandez told USA Today. “That was the capybaras’ land years ago before this rich community built homes on top of the wetland. So a lot of us in Argentina are rooting for these capybaras to mess with the rich and out of touch. They’re wreaking havoc.”Those taking the capybaras’ side include scientists. Sebastian di Martino, biologist and conservation director at the Rewilding Argentina foundation, told the AFP that Nordelta was built over an “exceptionally rich wetland that should never have been touched.”And ecologist Enrique Viale, who is fighting for a law to protect wetlands, told The Guardian that it would be backward to say capybaras are “invading” the community.“It’s the other way round: Nordelta invaded the ecosystem of the carpinchos,” he said."}, {"title": "President Joe Biden Visits Hurricane-Ravaged Louisiana", "text": "President Joe Biden visited Louisiana days after Hurricane Ida wreaked havoc in the region, destroying homes and leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power for days.At a briefing with local officials at St. John Parish’s Emergency Operations Center in LaPlace on Friday, Biden said he understood the frustration of many residents with the widespread lack of power.“There’s nothing political about this. It’s just simply about saving lives and getting people back up and running,” Biden said. “We’re in this together, and so we’re not going to leave any community behind — rural, city, coastal, inland. I promise we’re gonna have your backs until this gets done.”Five days after the hurricane tore through Louisiana and Mississippi, some 700,000 people are still without power, according to electric company Entergy. Some could remain without electricity for weeks.The president noted that “things have changed so drastically in terms of the environment,” and called for investments in infrastructure that would be “resilient” to climate change, like building levee systems and putting power lines underground. Such projects would also create “significant, good-paying jobs,” he said.“It costs a hell of a lot more money, but it also saves a hell of a lot more money,” Biden said of climate-resilient infrastructure. “We could save a whole lot of money, and a whole lot of pain.”Biden toured hard-hit neighborhoods in LaPlace and planned to conduct aerial tours of other storm-ravaged areas and meet with local leaders in Lafourche Parish.In remarks from LaPlace, Biden called Hurricane Ida “another reminder that we need to be prepared for the next hurricane,” saying such superstorms are going to “come more frequently and more ferociously.”“Folks, I know you’re hurting,” Biden said, noting that communities around Lake Charles are still recovering from Hurricanes Laura and Delta, which hit last year. “We’re gonna be here for you ... This is not about being a Democrat or a Republican. We’re Americans, and we’ll get through this together.”Ida, intensified by climate change, was one of the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in U.S. history.After the hurricane’s wreckage in the Gulf Coast, Ida was downgraded to a tropical storm that moved to the Northeast mid-week and killed dozens of people with flash flooding in New York and New Jersey.At least 61 people across eight states are dead due to Ida, according to ABC News.

Thousands have fled the area amid mandatory evacuations.“Anything that gets moisture in the air is good,” CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said of the firefighting strategy.Snowmaking machines mix compressed air and water in a powerful torrent. In winter, the snow guns “shoot water into the air and it condensates and turns into snow,” Ward pointed out. “In this case, it was just to attempt to get things wet.”Sierra-at-Tahoe had its machines ready to go and mobilized them as the flames crept closer this week.“We had them in place preventatively and we had a snowmaking system all charged up and ready to go,” general manager John Rice told The Tahoe Daily Tribune. “As the fire ... started coming toward us, we turned them on.”The resort lost a maintenance building to the flames.Cal Fire has set up a base camp at Heavenly.“Our snowmaking systems are up and running at Heavenly working hard to protect the resort and the surrounding areas,” said a message posted on the ski resort’s Instagram account.The resort is making grants available to people in the area under mandatory evacuation — and is “prioritizing food, shelter, and mental health support,” the message added. “We also continue to thank those people on the front lines fighting to keep us all safe,” it read.The Caldor Fire grew to almost 211,000 acres and was 27% contained as of Thursday. There was “reduced activity” Wednesday because winds were finally calmer.The blaze has destroyed some 622 homes and has threatened over 32,000 structures, Cal Fire reported.More than 15,000 firefighters are battling dozens of blazes in the state. The U.S. Forest Service has shut down all national forests in California until Sept. 17 as a precaution."}, {"title": "900,000 In Louisiana Still Without Power Following Hurricane Ida", "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Louisiana officials launched an investigation into the deaths of four nursing home residents who had been evacuated to a warehouse ahead of Hurricane Ida, as state residents struggling in the wake of the storm sought financial relief and other help amid small signs of recovery.The nursing home residents who died were among hundreds of people from seven nursing homes taken to the warehouse in Independence, where conditions became unhealthy and unsafe after the hurricane struck on Sunday, state health officials said. A coroner classified three of the deaths as storm-related.Health officials received reports of people lying on mattresses on the floor, not being fed or changed and not being socially distanced to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which is currently ravaging the state, Louisiana Department of Health spokesperson Aly Neel said. When a large team of state health inspectors showed up on Tuesday to investigate the warehouse, the owner of the nursing homes demanded that they leave immediately, Neel said.Neel identified the owner as Bob Dean. Dean did not immediately respond Thursday to a telephone message left by The Associated Press at a number listed for him.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards promised a full investigation into whether the owner “failed to keep residents safe and whether he intentionally obstructed efforts to check in on them and determine what the conditions were in the shelter.” And he vowed “aggressive legal action” if warranted.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden was scheduled to visit Louisiana on Friday to survey the damage after promising full federal support to Gulf Coast states and the Northeast, where the remnants of Ida dumped record-breaking rain and killed at least 46 people from Maryland to Connecticut.At least 13 deaths were blamed on the storm in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, including the three nursing home residents and two 19-year-old utility employees who were electrocuted Tuesday as they were restoring power near Birmingham, Alabama. Authorities blamed several other deaths on carbon monoxide poisoning.About 900,000 people in Louisiana, including much of New Orleans, remained without power and tens of thousands had no water in the midst of a sultry stretch of summer. Efforts continued to drain flooded communities, and lines for gas stretched for blocks in many places from New Orleans to Baton Rouge.Edwards said more than 220,000 people have already registered for FEMA assistance and 22,000 have applied for a federal program to place tarps on damaged roofs. About 72,000 “blue roofs” – tarps to protect homes with damaged roofs – may be needed across Louisiana, federal officials said.“I know that people are anxious and tired,” Edwards said Thursday. “I know they’re hot. And the tempers can flare when they’re waiting in those long gas lines. I’m asking people to be patient.”But there were also glimmers of hope. Commercial flights resumed in New Orleans and power returned to parts of the business district Thursday, four days after Hurricane Ida slammed into the Gulf Coast with 150 mph (230 kph) winds that tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to strike the mainland U.S.Louisiana officials also reported a big drop late Thursday in the number of customers with no running water: 185,000, compared to more than 600,000 the day before.Some of New Orleans’ hospitals have seen their regular power supply restored, said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department. A senior center has been converted to a place for residents to receive limited health care, she added at a Thursday briefing.Declining numbers of COVID-19 patients and restoration of power at additional sites helped Louisiana’s largest hospital system — Ochsner Health — recover, CEO Warner Thomas said during an online news conference. The Ochsner system’s COVID-19 patient count fell to 663 from 990 about a week ago, Thomas said. That coincides with the state’s overall declining case numbers.Power should be restored to most customers around Baton Rouge area by Sept. 8. after workers finish assessing damage, Entergy Louisiana President Philip May said Thursday. Damage assessments are not as far along in the harder-hit regions, so Entergy said it has no timetable for getting service to those areas, which include New Orleans.Biden ordered the release of extra fuel from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure a steady supply. He said he would also provide utilities with satellite images to help restore power.___Deslatte reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

As the death toll mounted Thursday, so too did new questions about how prepared the nation’s largest city is for climate change-fueled megastorms ― and how Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams plans to deal with it.So far, advocates say his approach remains vague ― his campaign website doesn’t feature climate change among the candidate’s six core issues ― and statements from his camp suggest he may weaken the landmark law already in place to cut planet-heating pollution.Adams, 61, is a retired police officer and the current Brooklyn borough president who has pitched himself as a tough-on-crime maverick. He defeated a crowded field of rivals in the June primary, including high-profile contenders who ran on detailed, wonky plans to curb emissions and fortify the five boroughs against extreme weather. He’s now considered a shoo-in against Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa when the overwhelmingly Democratic city votes in November’s general election.But the deadliest cyclone to hit New York City since 2012’s Superstorm Sandy has put new scrutiny on how an Adams administration will manage future disasters and meaningfully slash the city’s output of greenhouse gases.“It is striking that here he is, months away from being the mayor of the largest city in the country, and we don’t really know where he stands on some of the most important environmental issues facing the city,” said Judith Enck, who served as New York’s regional Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the Obama administration. “This can certainly be remedied with strong staff, but the big decisions will come from him.”The Adams campaign’s seven-page climate plan offers paragraph-long promises to hasten the deployment of electric buses, offer new tax credits for energy efficiency, and “step up on resiliency” by burying power lines. Adams separately proposed a series of steps to make New York City a manufacturing hub for the offshore wind industry. In an email, a top adviser said Adams is “against all new fossil fuel infrastructure such as pipelines” and “for converting” the city’s entire fleet of peaker plants ― about a dozen oil- and gas-fired power stations that roar online when demand for electricity exceeds the grid’s supply ― to batteries paired with renewable generators.“Eric has called for significant changes to how we approach resiliency — including a comprehensive citywide process to determine where we need to invest in coordination with our state and federal partners and metrics for tracking the number of people at risk of injury from a flood, properties at risk of damage from, and the cost liability to public and private property from a flood,” said Evan Thies, the campaign’s adviser, in an emailed statement.Appearing on television amid the downpour Wednesday night, Adams said he had “never witnessed something like this.”“It’s real that global warming is here,” he added.Adams will likely take office next year at the helm of a city with growing emissions. In April, the nuclear plant that produced 80% of New York City’s carbon-free electricity, Indian Point, shut down, making the city almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels for power.While offshore wind turbines may replace some of that output, they are still years away from coming online. And a transmission line project to carry hydropower down the Hudson River from dams in Canada has floundered for 13 years amid opposition from environmentalists and property owners.Though the City Hall of one of the world’s largest municipal economies provides a powerful bully pulpit to lobby for policy changes in both the state and national capital, the mayor has little power over electrical systems and utilities that answer to regulators in Albany or Washington.The same is largely true of the emissions from vehicle tailpipes, the largest single source of climate pollution. While Adams said he supports adding congestion pricing tolls to limit traffic into Manhattan and raise money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-run agency that controls the subways, control over the policy rests in state hands. Convincing drivers to switch to electric vehicles, meanwhile, requires federally funded infrastructure and tax credits.The more than 1 million buildings that bristle from the New York archipelago and make up the city’s iconic skyline, however, fall squarely under municipal control.That’s why, in 2007, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg established his PlaNYC sustainability program in a bid to track and ultimately lower the city’s pollution. By 2013, his administration phased out some of the dirtiest heating oils used to heat homes, delivering some of the cleanest air New Yorkers had breathed in half a century.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was term-limited this year, overlooked climate change when he first took office the following year. Over the past few years, the incumbent Democrat sued big oil companies over climate damages and divested its pension funds of coal stocks, and ultimately presided over the most significant emissions-cutting law ever passed in the city.That 2019 law, known as Local Law 97, mandates landlords retrofit big buildings ― most of those over 25,000 square feet, which generate about a third of the city’s climate pollution ― to cut emissions from the sector 40% by the end of the decade. Those cuts increase to 80% by 2050. The legislation, which comes into full force in 2024, earned de Blasio plaudits from once-critical activists as “America’s best climate mayor.”But the real estate industry, by far New York’s most powerful local business sector, fiercely opposed the law, and lobbied legislators in Manhattan and Albany to water it down. The law already gives landlords the option to buy limited numbers of renewable energy credits instead of making costly upgrades, offsetting part of their buildings’ pollution by funding the construction of new clean electricity projects for the city.Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat who resigned in disgrace over sexual harassment allegations last month, proposed a carve-out that would allow building owners to tap a virtually unlimited pool of credits including those for projects that already exist elsewhere in the state ― a scheme critics say would enrich some companies but do nothing to reduce emissions. The proposal failed in the state legislature in April.But a spokesman for Adams seemed to signal the likely next mayor’s willingness to reduce fines on landlords who fail to comply with the law. Jonah Allon, a spokesman for the borough president’s office, told Politico last month that Adams was “concerned that we will not reach our environmental goals unless the City works to reduce the costs of retrofits and upgrades that will be prohibitively expensive for some owners, as well as unfair fines that punish efficient buildings.”The remark echoed the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry’s most influential lobbying group, many of whose members were among Adams’ biggest donors. It stoked concerns that wealthy interests de Blasio shunned and Bloomberg, a billionaire, didn’t need to finance his campaigns could wield greater influence over the next administration than at any point in two decades.Enck called the comment “chilling.” Eddie Bautista, the executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, warned Adams’ efforts to “actively engage and solicit the real estate industry” were concerning. Pete Sikora, a senior adviser to the climate campaign group New York Communities for Change, said the statement suggests Adams may “defang” a law that, if fully implemented, would create up to 141,000 jobs in New York City by the end of the decade, per one Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher’s estimate.“There’s a huge question looming over Eric Adams’ rhetoric of fighting inequality and the reality of letting real estate off the hook on job creation and the climate crisis by making Local Law 97 toothless,” said Sikora, whose group marshaled protests that helped get the legislation passed. “It’s extremely troubling that his spokesperson signaled that he’s open to lowering penalties and is using the real estate industry’s talking points.”Asked what changes Adams would make to the law, Thies, who has previously consulted for the Real Estate Board of New York, said simply that Adams is “for the goals of Local Law 97.”The City Council is currently debating a bill to make New York the biggest city yet to ban gas hookups in new or renovated buildings that supporters hope to pass this year. The legislation, known as Intro. 2317, would take effect two years after its passage, potentially moving the 2030 deadline the de Blasio administration set for phasing out heating and cooking gas in new buildings to as early as 2023.Though the bill was introduced shortly before the election, Adams was the lone primary candidate to endorse maintaining the original 2030 deadline, while seven of his rivals said they would support a more ambitious date. His campaign did not respond to a question about whether he supports the legislation.Corey Johnson, the council speaker, has yet to say if he will back the bill. If passed, however, de Blasio said he would sign it into law. But it would be up to Adams to implement a mandate the real estate industry opposes.Costa Constantinides, the former city council member who authored Local Law 97, said Adams should not only defend the landmark legislation, but also “move the ball forward” with new climate mandates.“Despite what big real estate says, we don’t have time for small, incremental measures,” he said shortly after Shop-Vac-ing the water that flooded his Queens apartment Wednesday night. “We have to be bold. Now is the moment to be bold, and days like today only reaffirm that.”Tiffany Cabán, the left-wing Democratic nominee all but guaranteed to fill Constantinides’ seat on the council, said the likely next crop of lawmakers in the city’s legislature would form a bulwark to preserve the progress New York has made on climate.“There is overwhelming alignment between council members, especially the progressive incoming members,” she said. “Climate change is here. It’s now. We needed to act yesterday and there has to be absolutely no excuses. This is about survival.”Despite concerns, some in the climate world say they’re hopeful about Adams.“The Adams administration is going to be full of really smart people who can confront this,” said Alexander Gleason, a political strategist who works on clean energy issues at the Manhattan lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs.Though his current borough president job has limited powers to make infrastructure changes, Adams pressed for regulatory tweaks that would make it easier to clean up limbs downed during storms and proposed revamping wastewater treatment plants. He waxed poetic in a Q&A with the nonprofit Waterfront Alliance about his plans to alleviate the “physical and psychological barriers to recapture our waterfront and reconnect our communities to the waterfront that has played such an important role in our city’s history, and will play in its future.”And there are clear steps Adams could take next year to help prevent New York City’s growing number of basement apartments ― some of the few places poorer families, particularly immigrants, can afford in the extremely expensive metropolis ― from turning into death traps when torrents flood the city. Such was the case on Wednesday night, when a 2-year-old boy and his two family members drowned in a subterranean unit in the working-class neighborhood of Woodside, Queens.When the cost of fighting COVID-19 forced the city to make budget cuts last year, the funding for a program to make basement apartments safer fell from $12 million to just $91,580.“I’ve been talking to constituents today, and the overarching theme is that those who live in basement apartments are more susceptible to not only losing their entire apartment but also their lives,” said Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic state assemblyman in the western Queens neighborhood of Astoria.“I was disappointed by the lack of focus in the primary on the climate crisis, and I really hope the Adams administration will have an immense focus on this and understand this is a radical issue that requires radical solutions,” he added. “We have to face up to the reality that storms like this will happen again.”"}, {"title": "Extreme Heat Could Kill Nearly 60,000 Americans Yearly By 2050: Report", "text": "In the coming decades, extreme heat could kill tens of thousands of Americans each year if significant action isn’t taken to combat the climate crisis, according to a new report.The report released Tuesday by the Adrienne-Arsht Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, which studies climate change’s impacts, found that nearly all U.S. counties will be affected by extreme heat in the coming years, disproportionately impacting Black and Latinx people.Extreme heat could cause nearly 60,000 excess deaths per year by 2050, per the report.While under existing conditions, about 8,500 deaths annually can be attributed to extreme heat, without action to mitigate or adapt to climate change, such deaths will increase more than sixfold in the next 30 years, with most heat deaths in Arizona, California and Texas.Currently, about 16.5 million people in the U.S. — or 5% of the country — experience 100+ days each year above 90 degrees. By 2050, without significant action, over 130 million people — or 30% of the U.S. population — would live in 90+ degree heat for over 100 days.Extreme heat disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx workers, who experience about 35 to 45 days with temperatures above 90, per the report. By contrast, white workers experience about 25 to 30 such days.“Extreme heat is killing Americans,” Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Arsht-Rock Resilience Center, said in a release. “These numbers represent a red hot call to action.”The report runs through the many impacts of high heat on everyday life, including: heat stress leading to heat-related illness or exacerbating chronic illness like cardiovascular or pulmonary issues; heat stress leading to reduced crop yields in agriculture, and farmworkers unable to work from being ill or injured due to the heat; and heat negatively impacting students’ ability to learn in schools without air conditioning.The report estimates that while currently, the U.S. loses an average of $100 billion per year from heat-related declines in labor productivity, by 2050, the country could lose five times as much, or $500 billion dollars annually.The dangers of extreme heat are evident from the climate disasters of recent months: This summer, a record-breaking heatwave in the Pacific Northwest killed hundreds of people and left agriculture workers, many of them undocumented, suffering through 100+ degree days to get food on people’s tables.This week’s Hurricane Ida, intensified by climate change, left hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana and Mississippi without electricity for refrigeration or air conditioning as temperatures hovered in the high 80s.And record-breaking wildfires in California, which have been made more severe by climate change, have been burning since mid-August. The Caldor Fire in Northern California, has charred over 200,000 acres, destroyed over 800 houses and other structures and caused thousands to evacuate their homes as the fire approaches Lake Tahoe."}, {"title": "Here Are The Records Ida Toppled", "text": "Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast on Sunday as a Category 4 hurricane, making it one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall in the state.But it was in the Northeast, hundreds of miles from the Louisiana coast, that the downgraded storm toppled rainfall records, caused rivers to swell to near historic highs and spawned tornadoes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Climate change no doubt supercharged the storm’s broad, devastating impact in many ways.Ida’s devastation across the Northeast is “a reminder that the name and category of a storm aren’t necessarily correlated with impact,” Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and a former president of the American Meteorological Society, wrote in a Twitter post Thursday morning.The death toll from Ida in the Northeast has already surpassed the toll in the Southeast.Below are some of the records and near records Ida set on its violent journey from the Gulf of Mexico to New England.Hurricane Ida tied last year’s Hurricane Laura and the Last Island Hurricane of 1856 as the strongest recorded cyclone on record to hit Louisiana. When it came ashore south of New Orleans as a Category 4 hurricane, it had maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour.NASA said preliminary data shows that Ida was also the fifth strongest hurricane to ever make landfall in the continental United States.As Ida made landfall, a wind instrument aboard a ship in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, recorded a gust of 172 miles per hour — among the strongest ever recorded from a hurricane on U.S. soil, according to The Weather Channel.Until Ida, New York City had never once been under a flash flood emergency — the most severe type of flood alert that the National Weather Service issues.“This is a life-threatening situation,” the emergency read. “Seek higher ground now!”A flash flood emergency is reserved for “exceedingly rare situations when extremely heavy rain is leading to a severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage,” according to the Weather Service’s website. It is more dire than both a flash flood watch and warning.It was just the second time that the Weather Service’s office in New York had had to issue such an alert. The first came one hour earlier for Northeast New Jersey.Ida delivered a stunning amount of rain across a huge swath of the Northeast. Parts of the tri-state area saw upwards of 10 inches over a 48-hour period.Newark, New Jersey, experienced its wettest day in recorded history on Wednesday, with more than 8.41 inches of rain. That shattered the previous 24-hour record of 6.73 inches, set in 1977.New York City’s Central Park saw an astonishing 3.15 inches of rain in a single hour on Wednesday. The deluge broke the park’s previous single-hour record of 1.94 inches set just 11 days earlier during Tropical Storm Henri.Some of the most severe flooding is occurring in central Pennsylvania, where at least three storm-related fatalities occurred.The Schuylkill River in Philadelphia crested Thursday morning at 16.35 feet, just shy of the 17-foot record set in 1869. And the Conestoga River in Lancaster reached 18.49 feet, the third highest crest on record.Ida’s weeklong wrath comes as the U.S. enters what is typically the most active part of the Atlantic hurricane season. Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the National Hurricane Center, told The New York Times that 78% of tropical storms, 87% of minor hurricanes and 96% of major hurricanes occur between August and October, with the most activity usually in the first half of September."}, {"title": "Rudy Giuliani Gets Pranked On Cameo, And It's A Doozy", "text": "Rudy Giuliani got pranked again ― but at least he wasn’t caught with his hand down his pants.The former Donald Trump attorney apparently got tricked into praising a group that has investigated an energy firm founded by one of his clients.New York magazine’s Intelligencer on Wednesday posted a Cameo video (watch it below) of Giuliani happily rattling off the first names of journalists and activists, including Reuters’ Angus Berwick and human rights advocate Thor Halvorssen, who have reported negatively on Derwick Associates. Derwick is run by Alejandro Betancourt, whom Giuliani reportedly represented in an effort to persuade the Justice Department to drop its bribery and money-laundering investigation into the businessman.“This is Rudy Giuliani, and the message they want me to deliver is: The employees and the field staff of Derwick Associates want to thank you for your honesty and devotion, that you have fought for them for years and that — um — you’re very, very exceptionally dedicated.”Giuliani just weeks ago joined the Cameo service, in which people can pay celebrities to say “happy birthday” and other greetings. And it looks like he’s already being made a fool.“Well, that’s a nice thing!” Giuliani gushed about the greeting. “I really wish somebody would send me a message like that!”Giuliani appears to say “Terwick” instead of “Derwick,” suggesting he was deliberately being thrown off the scent of a ruse.“It’s hilarious, pitiful, surreal, and illustrative of his moral rot,” Halvorssen told Intelligencer. Halvorssen, who had sued Betancourt and Derwick Associates, said he had no idea who pulled the stunt.Giuliani did not respond to multiple requests for comment about his screening process from Intelligencer, but Uproxx noted that one of his spokespeople recently quit.Giuliani, who pressed Trump’s 2020 election lies in court, faces a $1.3 billion lawsuit and is under investigation for dealings in Ukraine, was notably pranked in the “Borat” sequel.

(AP) — With winds finally turning in their favor, firefighters are throwing all their resources into boxing a California blaze that was scant miles from Lake Tahoe and neighboring Nevada.Three days of fiercely gusting winds had driven the Caldor Fire east through the rugged Sierra Nevada, forcing tens of thousands of people from the region of forests, mountain hamlets, resorts and alpine lakes.The winds were expected to calm heading into the weekend, although the humidity remained low and the eastern side of the vast wildfire was still burning trees and running through explosively dry grasslands into rugged areas hard for firefighters to reach, authorities said.The blaze was also throwing sparks that caught trees and created spot fires up to a mile ahead of the main wall of flames.“We’re battling what we can battle and waiting for those winds to subside,” said Stephen Vollmer, a fire behavior analyst for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.Even so, the forecast made fire officials cautiously optimistic.The change could allow fire crews to get into densely forested areas to begin clearing toppled trees and branches that had blocked routes to remote communities, thus making it safer for evacuees to return, Vollmer said.Fire crews from around the country were being thrown into the fight against the fire, which was just 23% contained after destroying at least 700 homes and other buildings since breaking out Aug. 14.Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable, scientists say.The Caldor Fire threatened at least 33,000 more homes and structures. On Wednesday, firefighters were ferried by boat to protect cabins at Echo Lake, a few miles south of Tahoe.Heavenly Mountain Resort, Tahoe’s largest ski area, was being used as a staging area by firefighters. The resort also brought out its big guns — snow-making devices that were being used to hose down buildings.One spur of the fire was roughly 3 miles (5 kilometers) south of the recently evacuated city of South Lake Tahoe, moving northeast toward the California-Nevada state line, authorities said.Crews worked to keep flames away from urban communities, where houses are close together and shopping centers, hotels and other structures would provide even more fuel.Thick smoke has enveloped the city of South Lake Tahoe, which is all but deserted at a time when it would normally be swarming with tourists.After casinos and stores closed on the Nevada side on Wednesday morning, evacuation holdouts lacking cars lined up outside the Montbleu resort and casino in Stateline, awaiting a bus to Reno.Kevin O’Connell, a disabled plumber from South Lake Tahoe, planned on staying and riding out the evacuation order. But he went to the 7-11 down the street in Stateline and saw even stores there had closed.“I called 911 and told them I need to get out of here — I have no food, no cigarettes and I’m disabled. And within a couple hours, the police came and picked me up in my apartment and brought me here,” he said, wearing ski goggles to protect his eyes from the blowing ash.On Wednesday, President Joe Biden issued a federal emergency declaration and ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local resources for firefighting efforts and relief for residents in four counties affected by the fire.More than 15,000 firefighters, with help from out-of-state crews, were battling dozens of California blazes, including another monstrous blaze in the same area.Maj. Gen. David Baldwin, adjutant general of California, said the state has also deployed more than 1,000 National Guard soldiers, airmen and sailors and 10 other states have sent around 1,250 additional Guard members. Many of those are providing air support, including 23 aircraft, some equipped with water buckets, others with systems that can drop fire retardant.About 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of the Lake Tahoe-area blaze, the Dixie Fire is the second-largest wildfire in state history at about 1,320 square miles (3,415 square kilometers). The weeks-old fire prompted new evacuation orders and warnings this week and was just over 50% contained.___Har reported from San Francisco.

At least 23 people died in New Jersey, including four people in an apartment complex in Elizabeth. Pennsylvania officials also reported multiple fatalities outside Philadelphia, according to The Associated Press.About 150,000 homes across the four-state region were without power on Thursday in the aftermath of the storm.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency for the city and Gov.

Footage of the storm showed a large funnel cloud passing a bridge connecting the two states, and local media released initial reports of severe damage to some homes. Another tornado was reported in Annapolis, Maryland, causing widespread damage and leaving about 2,500 people without power.Rain poured in sheets across the nation’s largest city as New Yorkers’ phones buzzed with a National Weather Service warning declaring the flash floods a “dangerous and life-threatening situation.” The sky lit up repeatedly throughout the evening with bright blasts of lightning, and the streets in the western part of Queens, turned into swift, shallow rivers.The NWS urged New York City residents to move to high ground amid flash flooding and to not attempt to travel unless fleeing a dangerous area. Central Park saw more than 3 inches of rain in a single hour, surpassing the 1.94 inches in an hour that occurred during Tropical Storm Henri on Aug. 21, which was believed to be the record.“This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION,” the NWS wrote on Twitter just before 10 p.m. EDT. “SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!”Parts of the tri-state area had seen 6, 7 or 8 inches of rain in 48 hours.

You do not know how deep the water is and it is too dangerous.”Later Wednesday, Gov. Hochul declared a state of emergency to aid residents impacted by the storm.“New Yorkers are very concerned tonight and they’re scared,” she told CNN Wednesday night, urging residents to stay put while adding she could not guarantee rescue workers would be able to rescue those who leave their homes and get trapped in floodwaters.The storm also prompted suspensions at the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, underway in Queens, amid a tornado watch.Hurricane Ida made landfall on Sunday as a Category 4 behemoth, packing sustained winds of about 150 mph and causing “catastrophic” damage across Louisiana. Much of New Orleans remains without power days later, although officials have confirmed just seven fatalities related to the storm so far.

At least 14 fatalities were reported in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, bringing the storm’s estimated death toll to 21.Earlier, after Hurricane Ida smashed into the Louisiana coast as a catastrophic Category 4 storm, Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) warned that the death toll was likely to rise sharply as rescue crews scoured neighborhoods left in ruin. At that point, officials had confirmed just seven storm-related fatalities: three Louisiana residents, two electrical workers in Alabama and two people who died when floodwaters collapsed a highway in Mississippi.But if previous record-breaking storms are any guide, Ida’s toll could climb further. That’s because even though evacuations and beefed-up coastal protections help spare lives as the storm rages, flooding, blocked roads and a blackout expected to last weeks threaten lives with waterborne illnesses, a lack of food and medicine, and no electricity to run vital medical equipment or keep insulin refrigerated. Those at risk are mostly poor people who couldn’t afford the gas to leave or a hotel room to which they could flee.Fatalities directly and indirectly tied to Hurricane Katrina, for example, are still a matter of public debate 16 years after the storm. Katrina hammered New Orleans and much of the Southeast in September 2005, and the estimated deaths slowly crept up, from 964 in early October 2005 to 1,306 in late November. The official tally currently stands at more than 1,800, according to federal statistics.Hurricane Maria and Superstorm Sandy were similar stories. It wasn’t until nearly a year after the 2017 hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico that the territorial government revised its official storm death toll from 64 to 2,975 in response to the findings of a government-commissioned study. A separate investigation by Harvard researchers concluded that more than 4,600 people died in the aftermath, primarily due to interruptions in medical care.Sandy, which hit the Northeast in October 2012, left some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country’s richest metropolitan areas without power and inundated with water that, if it didn’t destroy homes outright, later rendered them uninhabitable with toxic mold.Ida, which tied last year’s Hurricane Laura as the most powerful storm to make landfall in Louisiana, has left more than 1 million people without electricity and 300,000 without access to clean water. Officials have said it could be weeks before power is fully restored. Adding to the suffering is a heat wave gripping much of Louisiana and Mississippi, with the heat index reaching 100 degrees.And the remnants of Ida continue to pack a punch as the system moves up the East Coast, threatening torrential rains and flash flooding as far as Maine.Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards & Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, said it’s important to recognize that hurricane death tolls are estimates, based largely on media reporting of fatalities during a specific window of time, and often don’t paint a complete picture. Fatalities in the wake of the storm — exposure to extreme heat or carbon monoxide poisoning from generators during power outages or from inland flooding long after the hurricane is downgraded — may or may not end up in the official tally.“It’s a problem with attribution,” she said. “It’s how you count deaths, how you attribute the deaths to a particular event and how long do you count for those deaths. It could be weeks to months, and we could still see the aftereffect where the major contributing factor was the hurricane.”Cutter said the COVID-19 pandemic could further distort Ida’s official death toll. Many hospitals across the South were at or near capacity when the storm struck and were overflowing with coronavirus patients amid the surge of the delta variant.“The coroners who are filling out the death certificates, frankly, just do not have time to do a lot of the paperwork” that ultimately ends up in public health databases, she said.Preventing additional loss of life often hinges on the ability to distribute essential supplies. Hani Mahmassani, a transportation and logistics expert at Northwestern University, said that, although damage to the power grid is the biggest issue in Louisiana, he’s heard a shortage of truck drivers has prevented necessary supplies from reaching hard-hit communities.“I’m hopeful that with sufficient resources, particularly using vertical-lift helicopters, one might be able to prevent something as bad as what we had in Puerto Rico, where you had areas that were completely cut off,” he said. “In this case, you do get a sense that the authorities are a little more on top of things.“Vulnerable populations are always going to suffer,” he added. “We will see unfortunate casualties related to that lack of supplies. But this is the challenge and this is where a lot of the relief workers and authorities are trying to focus and reestablish power as soon as possible.”This article has been updated to include Ida’s toll in the Northeast."}, {"title": "Baby Elephant Gets Adorable Help From Matriarch", "text": "A baby elephant’s mother was briefly “unaware” of her little one’s struggle up a riverbank, but the herd matriarch was there to pick up the slack, according to a video posted Tuesday by Latest Sightings.The matriarch used her trunk to nudge the peewee pachyderm up the slope in Botswana.Wildlife filmmaker Kim Wolhuter, who videotaped the moment, wrote in the description: “We all know that elephants are caring and help each other and the matriarch of the herd came to the rescue, making sure no one was left behind!”Is it just us or did the matriarch appear to mug for the camera, as if to say, “Yeah, the baby is adorable and I did a good deed”?The matriarch elephant “needs to have wisdom, strong connections and confidence to guide the other elephants,” according to For Elephants.And if she wants to flex, it’s OK by us!"}, {"title": "UN: Weather Disasters Soar In Numbers, Cost, But Deaths Fall Since '70s", "text": "GENEVA (AP) — Weather disasters are striking the world four to five times more often and causing seven times more damage than in the 1970s, the United Nations weather agency reports.But these disasters are killing far fewer people. In the 1970s and 1980s, they killed an average of about 170 people a day worldwide. In the 2010s, that dropped to about 40 per day, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report Wednesday that looks at more than 11,000 weather disasters in the past half-century.The report comes during a disaster-filled summer globally, including deadly floods in Germany and a heat wave in the Mediterranean, and with the United States simultaneously struck by powerful Hurricane Ida and an onslaught of drought-worsened wildfires.“The good news is that we have been able to minimize the amount of casualties once we have started having growing amount of disasters: heatwaves, flooding events, drought, and especially ... intense tropical storms like Ida, which has been hitting recently Louisiana and Mississippi in the United States,” Petteri Taalas, WMO’s secretary-general, told a news conference.“But the bad news is that the economic losses have been growing very rapidly and this growth is supposed to continue,” he added. “We are going to see more climatic extremes because of climate change, and these negative trends in climate will continue for the coming decades.”In the 1970s, the world averaged about 711 weather disasters a year, but from 2000 to 2009 that was up to 3,536 a year or nearly 10 a day, according to the report, which used data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Belgium. The average number of yearly disasters dropped a bit in the 2010s to 3,165, the report said.Most death and damage during 50 years of weather disasters came from storms, flooding and drought.More than 90% of the more than 2 million deaths are in what the U.N. considers developing nations, while nearly 60% of the economic damage occurred in richer countries.In the 1970s, weather disasters cost about $175 billion globally, when adjusted to 2019 dollars, the U.N. found. That increased to $1.38 trillion for the period from 2010 to 2019.What’s driving the destruction is that more people are moving into dangerous areas as climate change is making weather disasters stronger and more frequent, U.N. disaster and weather officials said. Meanwhile, experts said, better weather warnings and preparedness are lessening the death toll.Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, noted progress in learning to live with risk and protecting ourselves.“On the other hand, we’re still making stupid decisions about where we’re putting our infrastructure,” she said. “But it’s OK. We’re not losing lives, we’re just losing stuff.”Samantha Montano, an emergency management professor at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy and author of the book “Disasterology,” said she worries that death tolls may stop decreasing because of the increase in extreme weather from climate change especially hitting poorer nations.“The disparity in which countries have had the resources to dedicate to minimizing disaster deaths is of huge concern,” particularly due to climate change,” she said. “Deaths decreasing in recent decades does not mean that they will continue to do so unless we continue to invest in these efforts.”Hurricane Ida is a good example of heavy damage and what will probably be less loss of life than past major hurricanes, Cutter said. This year, she added, weather disasters “seem to be coming every couple weeks,” with Ida, U.S. wildfires and floods in Germany, China and Tennessee.The five most expensive weather disasters since 1970 were all storms in the United States, topped by 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. The five deadliest weather disasters were in Africa and Asia — topped by the Ethiopian drought and famine in the mid 1980s and Cyclone Bhola in Bangladesh in 1970.___Borenstein reported from Kensington, Maryland.___Read more of AP’s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/Climate___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears and Jamey Keaten at @jameykeaten.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

People cleared rotting food out of refrigerators. Neighbors shared generators and borrowed buckets of swimming pool water to bathe or to flush toilets.“We have a lot of work ahead of us and no one is under the illusion that this is going to be a short process,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said as the cleanup and rebuilding began across the soggy region in the oppressive late-summer heat.New Orleans officials announced seven places around the city where people could get a meal and sit in air conditioning. The city was also using 70 transit buses as cooling sites and will have drive-thru food, water and ice distribution locations set up on Wednesday, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said.Cantrell also ordered a nighttime curfew Tuesday, calling it an effort to prevent crime after Hurricane Ida devastated the power system and left the city in darkness. Police Chief Shaun Ferguson said there had been some arrests for stealing.The mayor also said she expects the main power company Entergy to be able to provide some electricity to the city by Wednesday evening, but stressed that doesn’t mean a quick citywide restoration. Entergy was looking at two options to “begin powering critical infrastructure in the area such as hospitals, nursing homes and first responders,” the company said in a news release.Cantrell acknowledged frustration in the days ahead.“We know it’s hot. We know we do not have any power, and that continues to be a priority,” she told a news conference.Edwards said state officials also were working to set up food, water and ice distribution. The governor’s office also said discussions were underway about establishing cooling stations and places where people on oxygen could plug in their machines, but officials had no details on when those might be up and running.More than 1 million homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi  — including all of New Orleans — were left without power when Ida slammed the electric grid on Sunday with its 150 mph (240 kph) winds, toppling a major transmission tower and knocking out thousands of miles of lines and hundreds of substations.An estimated 25,000-plus utility workers labored to restore electricity, but officials said it could take weeks.With water treatment plants overwhelmed by floodwaters or crippled by power outages, some places were also facing shortages of drinking water. About 441,000 people in 17 parishes had no water, and an additional 319,000 were under boil-water advisories, federal officials said.The number of deaths climbed to at least four in Louisiana and Mississippi, including two people killed Monday night when seven vehicles plunged into a 20-foot-deep (6-meter-deep) hole near Lucedale, Mississippi, where a highway had collapsed after torrential rains.Among the crash victims was Kent Brown, a “well-liked,” 49-year-old father of two, his brother Keith Brown said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Keith Brown said his brother was in construction but had been out of work for a while. He didn’t know where his brother was headed when the crash happened.Edwards said he expects the death toll to rise.In Slidell, crews searched for a 71-year-old man who was attacked by an alligator that tore off his arm as he walked through Ida’s floodwaters. His wife pulled him to the steps of the home and paddled away to get help, but when she returned, he was gone, authorities said.In New Orleans, drivers lined up for roughly a quarter-mile, waiting to get into a Costco that was one of the few spots in the city with gasoline. At other gas stations, motorists occasionally pulled up to the pumps, saw the handles covered in plastic bags and drove off.Renell Debose spent a week suffering in the New Orleans Superdome after 2005′s Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,800 people and left the city nearly uninhabitable. She said she is willing to give it a few days without electricity, but no more than that.“I love my city. I’m built for this. But I can’t make it without any air conditioning,” she said.Michael Pinkrah used his dwindling fuel to find food. He cradled his 3-week-old son in the back seat of an SUV and his 2-year-old daughter played in the front seat as his wife stood in a long line in the sweltering heat to get into one of the few grocery stores open in the city.Pinkrah said he and his wife thought about evacuating but couldn’t find a hotel room. They found out about the open store through social media. But even that link was tenuous.“We can’t charge our electronic devices to keep in contact with people. And without that, all of the communication just fails,” he said.In hard-hit Houma, the dismal reality of life without air conditioning, refrigeration or other more basic supplies began to sink in.“Our desperate need right now is tarps, gasoline for generators, food, water,” pastor Chad Ducote said. He said a church group from Mississippi arrived with food and supplies, and neighbors came to his pool to scoop up buckets of water.“The people down here are just doing what they can. They don’t have anything,” he said.Adding to the misery was the steamy weather. A heat advisory was issued for New Orleans and the rest of the region, with forecasters saying the combination of high temperatures and humidity could make it feel like 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday and 106 on Wednesday.Cynthia Andrews couldn’t go back to her New Orleans home if she wanted to. She was in a wheelchair, tethered by a power cord to the generator system running the elevators and hallway lights at the Le Meridien hotel.When the power went out Sunday, the machine that helps Andrews breathe after a lung collapse in 2018 stopped working. The hotel let her stay in the lobby, giving her a cot after she spent nearly a whole night in her wheelchair.“It was so scary, but as long as this thing keeps running, I’ll be OK,” she said.___Deslatte reported from Thibodaux, Louisiana.

(AP) — A day after an explosive wildfire emptied a resort city at the southern tip of Lake Tahoe, a huge firefighting force braced for strong winds Tuesday as residents in neighboring Nevada were put on notice to be ready to flee.The city of South Lake Tahoe, usually bustling with summer tourists, was eerily empty and the air thick and hazy with smoke from the Caldor Fire, one of two major blazes plaguing California. On Monday, roughly 22,000 residents jammed the city’s main artery for hours after they were ordered to leave as the fire advanced, chewing up drought-stricken vegetation.City officials said only a handful defied the order. But nearly everyone worried Tuesday about what the fire would do next.“It just kind of sucks waiting. I mean, I know it’s close down that way,” said Russ Crupi, gesturing south from his home in the Heavenly Valley Estates mobile home park, which he and his wife manage for a living. He had arranged sprinklers and tractors around the neighborhood.“I’m worried about what’ll be here when people come back. People want to come back to their houses and that’s what I’m going to try to do,” he said.Pushed by strong winds, the Caldor Fire crossed two major highways and burned mountain cabins as it swept down slopes into the Tahoe Basin. More firefighters arrived just after dark Monday, and many were dispatched to protect homes in the Christmas Valley area, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from South Lake Tahoe.Thick smoke prevented air firefighting operations periodically last week. But since then, nearly two dozen helicopters and three air tankers dumped thousands of gallons of water and retardant on the fire, fire spokesman Dominic Polito said Tuesday.The National Weather Service warned of critical fire weather conditions through Wednesday due to strong gusts, very low humidity and extremely dry fuel.The Lake Tahoe area is usually a year-round recreational paradise offering beaches, water sports, hiking, ski resorts and golfing. South Lake Tahoe bustles with outdoor activities while just across the state border in Stateline, Nevada tourists can gamble at major casinos.But on Tuesday, only a few dozen tourists remained on the casino floor of the Montbleu Resort, Casino and Spa. The state board that controls gaming said that casino regulators were monitoring operations at the four largest gambling properties in the city.Hotels are housing evacuees, fire crews and other emergency personnel. In all, Harrah’s, Harveys Lake Tahoe Casino, the Hard Rock and Montbleu Resort have more than 2,200 hotel rooms.Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak urged residents to be prepared, saying there was no timeline for when evacuations might be ordered. At a news conference in Carson City, he noted that ash was falling on him even though the fire was about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away.“I’m standing here and I’m getting all ash particulates on my jacket, even,” the governor said. “This is serious, folks.”Evacuation shelters at community centers in Carson City and Douglas County were at capacity, officials said Tuesday. Additional sites were open at a park in Carson City, the Reno Sparks Convention Center and a rodeo event center in Dayton and Lyon County fairgrounds in Yerington.At the Douglas County Community & Senior Center in Gardnerville, people had their temperature checked before entering a gymnasium of cots set up by the Red Cross. Outside, evacuees who had stayed in tents sorted through ramen noodles and plastic bags of clothes and keepsakes.South Lake Tahoe resident Lorie Major was at the grocery store when she got the alert on her phone.“I had to tell myself: ’OK, Lorie: Get it together. It’s time to go,’” she said.She put on headphones, turned on the Grateful Dead’s “Fire on the Mountain” and walked home to an empty apartment complex already vacated by neighbors. She and her mini Australian shepherd, Koda, took a 20-mile (32-kilometer) taxi ride from her South Lake Tahoe apartment to a hotel in Minden, Nevada.More than 15,000 firefighters were battling dozens of California blazes, with help from out of state crews. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive, scientists say.The threat of fire is so widespread that the U.S. Forest Service announced Monday that all national forests in California would be closed until Sept. 17.Crews are battling the Dixie, the second-largest wildfire in state history at 1,260 square miles (3,267 square kilometers). The weeks-old fire was burning about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of the Lake Tahoe-area blaze and prompting new evacuation orders and warnings this week.The Caldor Fire has scorched nearly 300 square miles (777 square kilometers) since breaking out Aug. 14. After the weekend’s fierce burning, containment dropped from 19% to 16%.More than 600 structures have been destroyed, and at least 33,000 more were threatened.The last two wildfires that ripped through populated areas near Tahoe were the Angora Fire that destroyed more than 200 homes in 2007 and the Gondola Fire in 2002 that ignited near a chairlift at Heavenly Mountain Resort.At the evacuation center in Gardnerville, Joe Gillespie said he, his girlfriend and her son left their home in Meyers south of South Lake Tahoe on Sunday, bringing clothes, picture frames and collectibles like Hot Wheels toys from the 1960s that Gillespie’s mother gave him.Gillespie, a mechanic at Sierra-at-Tahoe Resort, said that unlike the northern shore of Lake Tahoe, which is dotted with mansions and second homes, the area currently under threat houses blue-collar workers who make their living at the casinos and ski resorts that make the area so popular.The Sierra-at-Tahoe Resort is beloved for its unpretentious and comparatively affordable winter prices. It turns 75 this year, he said.“It sounds like we won’t be opening because of the fire,” he said.___Har reported from San Francisco.

But the Trump rule remained in place in the meantime, and environmental groups, Native American tribes and others said it could lead to the loss of wetlands, damage wildlife habitat and allow businesses and farmers to pollute waterways.U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Marquez in Arizona, an Obama appointee, sided with those groups on Monday, determining that the Trump administration’s rule last year improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. Marquez said the Environmental Protection Agency had ignored its own findings that small waterways can affect the well-being of the larger waterways they flow into.The EPA, now headed by Biden appointee Michael Regan, said it is reviewing the decision and declined to comment. In June, Regan said the agency planned to issue a new rule that protects water quality while not overly burdening small farmers.The water rule — sometimes called “waters of the United States” or WOTUS — has long been a point of contention. In 2015, the Obama administration expanded federal protection to nearly 60% of the nation’s waterways. Because the Obama rule also faced several legal challenges, Monday’s decision puts back in place a 1986 standard — which is broader in scope than the Trump rule but narrower than Obama’s — until new regulations are issued.According to an earlier review by the Biden administration, the Trump rule allowed more than 300 projects to proceed without the federal permits required under the Obama-era rule. The review also found the Trump rule significantly curtailed clean water protections in states such as New Mexico and Arizona.Those changes were challenged in court by six Native American tribes that said the Trump rule defied the law’s environmental focus. Until it was revoked, the rule was “causing irreparable damage to our nation’s waters,” said Janette Brimmer, a lawyer for Earthjustice, an environmental group that represented the tribes.Gunnar Peters, chair of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, one of the tribes that sued, said federal water regulation “protects our history, our culture, and our people’s way of life.”Mondays’ ruling takes effect nationwide and could have an immediate impact. In Georgia, a proposed titanium mine a few miles from the edge of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge could require federal approval after all. Last year, the Army Corps of Engineering determined that it no longer had jurisdiction over the project. On Tuesday, an Army Corps spokesman said it is too early to determine how the ruling will affect its involvement with the project.Also affected are developers and other businesses that stood to benefit from regulatory and financial relief under the Trump rule. Advocates for less restrictive federal regulation say protection of waterways should be left to states.Chuck Fowke, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the group was disappointed by Monday’s ruling. He said the decision will lead to confusion about where home builders could develop and result in “longer delays and higher housing costs.”____Phillis reported from St. Louis.

The lifting of these pollution restrictions has served as a stark reminder of the staggering, deadly consequences of the pandemic.It’s also raised another question: What are the environmental impacts of our deaths ― and how can we reduce them?Since 2015, cremation using fire has become the most popular death care practice in the U.S., with almost 58% of Americans projected to use cremation in 2021, according to data collated by the National Funeral Directors Association.But as cremation ― which often burns fossil fuels like natural gas ― becomes more commonplace, concerns about its effects on the environment and climate have also been mounting.Cremating a single corpse typically takes up to three hours of burning and releases almost 600 pounds of carbon dioxide ― the equivalent of a 500-mile car journey ― into the atmosphere. Toxic metals like mercury, which can be found in some dental fillings, and other particulate matter can also be released, though many U.S. crematoriums now have filtration and scrubbing systems that can neutralize these. The filtration systems, however, do not block the release of carbon dioxide.Some estimates suggest that cremations in the U.S. account for about 360,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year. Globally, that number climbs into the millions of metric tons.Compared to other sources of greenhouse gas emissions, these numbers may seem relatively small. A single cremation only accounts for a fraction of the average American’s carbon footprint, which is estimated at more than 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.Still, with most of the world still very much not on track to fulfill the commitments laid out in the Paris climate agreement, an ever-increasing global population, and the burgeoning popularity of cremations worldwide, experts say their environmental impacts should not be dismissed.“In 1960, only about 3% of people in America were being cremated, so the impact to the environment was negligible,” said Dr. David Sloane, a history and urban planning professor at the University of Southern California. “But if you have 60 to 70% of Americans choosing cremation, that’s millions of people to think about ― and once you add up the numbers globally, you don’t just get a couple of million but many tens of millions, and then the concern becomes more real.”In many countries, cremation has become the death care option of choice for most people. In China, for instance, the cremation rate is estimated to be around 50%, but officials have said they hope this number will eventually reach 100%. In the United Kingdom and Canada, more than 70% of people choose cremation. In South Korea, the rate is closer to 90%, and in Japan, which is thought to have the highest cremation rate in the world, some 99% of people are reportedly cremated.Mark Shelvock, a death educator and lecturer at the University of Toronto, notes that the full effects of cremation globally remain unknown because of a scarcity of research.“There’s still no standardized body of knowledge when it comes to this,” he said. “But what we know for sure is that both cremation and conventional burial negatively impact the environment and the climate crisis we’re in.”Conventional burial is the second most common death care practice in the U.S., with about 36% of Americans projected to be buried in 2021, per NFDA data.Like cremation, the environmental impacts of burials are not insignificant.According to a 2017 study conducted by Elisabeth Keijzer, a sustainability researcher in the Netherlands, burial has a greater environmental impact overall compared to cremation due mostly to its land use. Keijzer notes in her study, however, that cremation has a far greater carbon footprint than burial and that both processes involve many raw materials and have potentially hazardous aftereffects.Burials in the U.S. typically involve embalming a body before it is placed inside a wood and metal casket, often lined with synthetic fabric. The casket is usually lowered into a grave in which a vault ― essentially a shoebox-type container made of plastic, metal, concrete or a combination of these materials ― has been placed. The vault is arranged over or around the casket to prevent the grave from collapsing when the coffin and body within eventually decompose. According to Sloane, vaults are used mostly for cosmetic purposes nowadays so grounds at cemeteries can be easily mowed and appear uniform.These burial materials all add up.Overall in the U.S., an estimated 20 million feet of wood, 4.3 million gallons of formaldehyde and other embalming fluids, 1.6 million tons of reinforced concrete, 17,000 tons of copper and bronze, and 64,500 tons of steel are put into the ground each year for burials, according to data collected by the Green Burial Council.These staggering numbers, coupled with concerns about climate change, have fueled a burgeoning movement across the country to create and find alternative, less environmentally taxing death care options.The Green Burial Council, a California-based nonprofit, has been among those at the forefront of this shift. The organization was launched in 2005 to educate consumers about so-called “green” burials, which typically diverge from conventional burials in their emphasis on simplicity and sustainability, and which provide certification for death care providers seeking a “green” label.Ed Bixby, the council’s president, said the market for green burials was very niche back when the organization was first founded, but that interest in more sustainable death care practices has skyrocketed in recent years.According to a 2018 survey by the NFDA, nearly 54% of Americans were considering a green burial, also known as natural or simple burial. The practice typically eschews embalming and vaults and is done either on conservation burial grounds or cemeteries that abide by sustainable practices.“With natural burial, it’s as simplistic as it sounds,” Bixby said. “You open a grave site and bury someone wearing or contained in something biodegradable or nothing at all. They go back the way they came ― you know, dust to dust.”Green burials haven’t been mainstream since at least the Civil War, Bixby said. After that era, simple burials ― once the norm ― gradually lost favor and were largely replaced by the more elaborate burial customs common today. (There have been exceptions. Traditional Jewish funerals, for instance, typically involve simple caskets and no embalming.)But over the past two decades and, increasingly, in the past few years, there’s been “a shift to natural burial again,” Bixby said.“It’s important to teach people their rights so they know they have choices and that their death can make a difference environmentally.”Today, green burial ― which Bixby said a majority of U.S. cemeteries can accommodate ― is the most accessible and widespread green death care option for Americans; but an innovative array of other sustainability-minded practices has begun to sprout in recent years.Cremated remains, for instance, can now be turned into trees or diamonds or coral reefs. More controversially, two newer death care methods ― alkaline hydrolysis (known also as aquamation, resomation or water cremation) and natural organic reduction, colloquially known as human composting ― have become available in recent years in some U.S. states.In aquamation, a body’s natural decomposition process is accelerated with the help of water, heat, pressure and potassium hydroxide, which is highly alkaline.The body is placed inside a steel chamber with a liquid mixture and is rocked side to side for two to three hours as it’s reduced to bones. Like fire cremation, some remains can be collected after the process: the bones, which are crushed into a fine powder and can be kept in an urn or scattered by loved ones; as well as several gallons of an organic, but sterile, liquid that advocates of the process say can be used to grow plants or be easily disposed of via the sewer system.“Some facilities capture the liquid, and it’s taken away and it’s used on some farmland; it’s an excellent fertilizer,” Nora Menkin, director of People’s Memorial Association, a Washington-based funeral education organization, told National Geographic in 2019 of aquamation. “But most places, it just goes into the municipal sewer system. And a lot of sewer systems actually appreciate it, because it actually helps with the quality of the wastewater.”Aquamation, first patented in the U.S. in the 1880s, was first promoted as a way to quickly decompose animal bodies. Then, as The New Republic reported, it began gaining popularity in the early 2000s among pet owners looking for ways to dispose of their beloved animals. The first U.S. state to legalize aquamation for humans was Minnesota in 2003. Today, at least 18 states, including Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Utah and Washington, allow the practice.Aquamation’s effects on the environment are thought to be far less than those of conventional body disposition methods. Estimates suggest the process uses anywhere from one-tenth to one-seventh of the energy required for cremation, and mercury emissions are not an issue (metals and dental fillings are separated from the body’s bones and disposed of separately).This was a key reason why Sheila Luna, who was then battling late-stage colon cancer, told her family she wanted aquamation after she died.“Sheila was a very environmentally conscious person,” her husband, Charles Luna, said from his home in Louisville, Colorado, last month. “She was a nutritionist and clinical herbalist and was a ‘live lightly on the Earth’ kind of person. She believed that the least she could do was to leave a better ― or, at the very least, not a worse ― planet for our children and their children. Choosing water cremation was part of that.”Sheila died in February 2020 at age 52. Charles and their two daughters respected her wishes and opted for aquamation ― a choice that Charles said helped him in his grief journey and healing after his wife’s death.“At other funerals I’ve been to, I didn’t get any more closure from the experience. It felt like a mannequin, all made up and artificial, that had been put in this tufted jewel box that was then going to pollute the ground. It never felt like a good celebration of their life,” Charles said.By contrast, he said, Sheila’s simple wake and funeral at their home, followed by her “gentle” aquamation, had been a “cathartic” rather than traumatic experience for him and his family.Aquamation’s perceived gentleness was a major reason Michele Bourgeois chose it for her son, Graham Hebert, after he tragically drowned on New Year’s Day this year. Graham, who was 30, fell into a frozen lake near his home in Littleton, Colorado; it took 38 days for his body to be recovered.Remembering that horrific time, Michele said in July that she was grateful for the sustainability-focused funeral home that she found to help her with the care of Graham’s body and for the alternative death care options they offered.“What happened after really helped with my healing. We didn’t pump him with chemicals or trap him in a box or set his body on fire ― an idea that scared me,” Michele said.“I had never heard of water cremation before this, but when I did, I knew it’s what Graham would have wanted,” she added. “The gentleness of the water appealed to me. He loved the water, he transitioned in water, and he cared about the environment.”Michele said she also liked the idea that some of Graham’s liquid remains could be used to fertilize trees and plants. She gave some of it to family members and friends who have since used it on their gardens and houseplants. She also used some to water a tree planted near a memorial bench dedicated to Graham at the lake where he died.“We used Graham’s liquid to nourish the tree, which will benefit the animals that will feed on it and the people who will enjoy its shade,” Michele said. “I love the idea of his physical remains nourishing another living thing. This process has been so much more healing to me than imagining him being stuck in a box that will then become toxic for the environment.”But while aquamation may be appealing to some, the practice has its vocal opponents.In 2015, a bill to legalize aquamation in Indiana was scuppered after a Republican lawmaker ― and owner of two casket-manufacturing companies ― argued against the legislation, calling the practice “not very human.”“We’re going to put them in acid and just let them dissolve away and then we’re going to let them run down the drain out into the sewers and whatever,” state Rep. Dick Hamm, owner of Paul Casket Company and Cambridge City Casket Company, said in a speech on the state House floor.As The New Republic noted, aquamation involves an alkaline substance, not acid, and “similar fluids are flushed down the drain during the embalming process.”Still, Hamm’s argument has been echoed by lawmakers and religious groups elsewhere in the country.In New Hampshire, where a bill legalized aquamation for two years before being repealed in 2008, arguments like Hamm’s have helped to block bills to re-legalize the practice.Republican state Rep. John Cebrowski said in 2009 that “I don’t want to send a loved one to be used as fertilizer or sent down the drain to a sewer treatment plant.” Four years later, amid another push to legalize aquamation, GOP state Sen. Sam Cataldo said he was concerned that the liquid byproducts of aquamation would negatively affect “our groundwater and aquifers.” (There’s no evidence that the process adversely affects water quality.)The Catholic Church of New Hampshire also spoke out against the practice, saying it lacked “respect” for the sanctity of a human body. Aquamation remains prohibited in the state.As with aquamation, an “ick” factor and lack of perceived respectability have similarly hindered the adoption of another new green death care method: natural organic reduction, or human composting.The practice, which essentially “composts” a human body into soil, involves placing a corpse inside a vessel with organic materials like straw, hay or wood chips, as well as microbes to speed up the decomposition process. It is currently only legal in three states: Washington, which was first to legalize it in 2019, and Colorado and Oregon, which only greenlighted the process this year.Washington is currently the only state where the service is offered; though plans are underway to open facilities in both Colorado and Oregon. Bills to legalize natural organic reduction are also being mulled in New York and California.Some Catholic groups have been vocal in their condemnation of the practice. The New York Catholic Conference expressly opposed the state’s legalization bill in April, saying natural organic reduction “fails to sufficiently respect the dignity due the deceased.” Catholic associations in Washington, Oregon and Colorado have dissented similarly, as have some in the funeral industry.One Washington funeral director was quoted in 2019 as saying that natural organic reduction was the “stupidest thing I ever heard of.”Despite the smattering of ridicule and censure, however, purveyors of the practice say there’s already been a flurry of demand for the service.Recompose, a Seattle-based death care company that’s been offering natural organic reduction since 2020, said it’s already served 60 families ― one-quarter of them coming from out of state ― since its launch.“We’ve been full since we opened,” Anna Swenson, Recompose’s outreach manager, said of the company’s early success, adding that more than 900 people have already prepaid for the service.At Recompose, mechanized vessels inside a temperature-controlled warehouse are used to process bodies. Swenson said it can take between 6 to 8 weeks for a body to “be completely transformed into soil.”About 1 cubic yard of soil ― the equivalent of about 1 pickup truck bed ― is removed from the vessel. Swenson said families have the option of taking home the soil or donating it to a conservation forest in southern Oregon, where it’s used to replenish degraded land.Herland Forest, a nonprofit cemetery located in Washington near the Oregon border, uses a slightly different composting process ― though the outcome is similar. There, a manually operated outdoor cradle-and-rack system can take anywhere from two to six months to compost a body, depending on the season, founder Walt Patrick said.“The cradle-and-rack system was inspired by a baby being rocked in a cradle. It’s a similar thing, but in this case, you’re going out of this world, not into it,” Patrick said of the process.Environmental concerns are a major motivator for people choosing natural organic composting, Patrick and Swenson said of their clients.“Similar to aquamation, natural organic composting uses about one-eighth of the energy required for cremation or burial,” Swenson said.She added that some clients simply “like the idea of literally returning to the earth.”“A lot of people are disgusted by the funeral industrial complex,” noted Patrick, referring to the corporatization of the U.S. funeral industry, which has been described as the “most expensive and corporate in the world.”“There’s a lot of exploitation of vulnerable, grieving people,” he said. “We have a lot to learn when it comes to death care and how to better facilitate that process.”Competitive and transparent pricing also appears to be a driving force behind the increasing demand for alternative death care practices. Dying is an expensive business: According to the NFDA, an average burial and funeral ceremony cost about $8,500 and an average cremation and funeral cost about $6,300.The funeral industry has been criticized for opaque pricing. In a 2015 report, the Consumer Federation of America and the Funeral Consumers Alliance lambasted the industry for its lack of transparency.“The huge price ranges for identical funeral services within individual areas indicate that these markets lack effective competition,” Stephen Brobeck, the consumer federation’s executive director, said in a statement. “The lack of price competition is unfortunate given the relatively high cost of funeral services and the reluctance of many bereaved consumers to comparison shop for these services.”In contrast, transparent pricing appears to be a common thread among providers in the green death care space.Karen van Vuuren, co-founder of The Natural Funeral in Boulder, Colorado, one of the first full-service green funeral homes in the state, said it was a no-brainer for them to have all their prices clearly listed on their website.“I just think we owe it to consumers to have pricing that’s really transparent,” she said.Green burial packages can cost between $1,000 and $4,000, while aquamation can cost between $1,500 and $3,000. Natural organic reduction can cost upwards of $3,000 and can vary significantly, depending on whether the body needs to be transported out of state.While these alternative death care options remain inaccessible to many Americans ― and continue to be shunned by some ― experts say they’ll likely grow in popularity over time and will eventually become more mainstream.Sloane, who authored “Is The Cemetery Dead?” in 2018, pointed out that people in the U.S. and Europe had been “horrified” by the idea of fire cremation when the first crematoriums were opened in the late 1800s.“The New York Times editorialized against it. The Catholic Church banned it. It was seen as anti-religious, anti-clerical, pagan,” said Sloane.Just as cremation gained acceptance over time, alternative death care methods will similarly expand, Sloane said, adding: “The question is, which of the choices will become more prevalent and which will diminish? And how fast will this change happen? That’s still unknown.”It appears the COVID-19 pandemic may have played a part in expediting this shift.“During the pandemic, we’ve been faced with something that we rarely talk about in life ― we’ve been faced with our mortality,” Bixby of the Green Burial Council said. “People have been forced to come to grips with it, to become more proactive and less fearful of death ― and looking into what they want for themselves and their loved ones after death.”In California earlier this year, state Assembly member Cristina Garcia, who has advocated for the legalization of natural organic reduction there, cited the staggering pandemic death toll as a reason to push for more sustainable death care practices.″[The pandemic situation] is another sad reminder that we must legalize a more environmentally friendly option as soon as possible,” Garcia said in a February statement.Ultimately, people in the green death care space say the most critical need is to provide consumers with more options for their after-death care ― and to ensure they’re educated on the choices available to them.“We’re not here to tell people what’s right for them or what ‘respectful’ means,” Swenson of Recompose said. “Whatever people want to choose, it’s their choice. It’s just about providing additional choices that people can have access to.”Discussing these options openly is also key, experts say, to creating a more healthy and holistic approach to death ― and death care, too.“One of the challenges of talking about green death practices is that death is still a taboo topic. It’s still not part of everyday conversation,” said Shelvock, the death educator. “We need to start normalizing these conversations about our mortality; we need to become more open-minded and more curious towards how we’re going to honor our loved ones and ourselves eventually. The more we can normalize talking about death, the better death systems we can create.”"}, {"title": "Fast-Spreading California Wildfire Reaches Lake Tahoe Basin", "text": "A massive fire in Northern California is spreading at alarming rates, burning hundreds of homes and approaching famed Lake Tahoe.The Caldor fire, which began Aug. 14, has burned more than 191,600 acres and is only 15% contained. The blaze has led to mass evacuations, destroyed over 660 homes and other buildings, and is threatening tens of thousands more.The fire’s rapid growth prompted the U.S. Forest Service to close almost all national forests in the state starting late Tuesday through Sept. 17. Officials said the closures will both reduce the potential for additional fires and minimize the likelihood of visitors becoming trapped in a forest in the event of another fire.“We do not take this decision lightly, but this is the best choice for public safety,” regional forester Jennifer Eberlien said in a release. “It is especially hard with the approaching Labor Day weekend, when so many people enjoy our national forests.”California State Parks followed suit, fully closing seven state parks and partially closing three others.A red flag warning issued by the National Weather Service forecast extremely dry conditions and 35 mph wind gusts that will persist through Wednesday evening, exacerbating already challenging firefighting conditions.On Monday, the fire entered the Lake Tahoe basin, an area that’s home to tens of thousands of people and welcomes millions of visitors as a summer and winter vacation destination.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) expanded its evacuation orders Monday to include all of South Lake Tahoe, where about 22,000 people live.Videos showed miles-long lines of traffic as people sought to escape.“There is fire activity in California that we have never seen before,” Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said in a press briefing on Monday. The fire chief noted that the Caldor fire had shown an “unprecedented” spread of more than 20,000 acres on Sunday.“Every acre can and will burn in this state,” the fire chief warned. “Be ready now.”More than a dozen large fires were burning across the state Monday, with over 15,000 firefighters working to stop them.The multiple fires burning throughout Northern California in recent weeks have caused unhealthful levels of smoke throughout the region.The human-caused climate crisis has worsened wildfires in California in recent years. Four out of the five largest fires in state history took place last year alone in a record-breaking year for fires in the state. This year has already surpassed last year’s in terms of the number of acres burned by blazes by this time of year.The Dixie fire, currently burning in Northern California, is now the second largest in state history. And the Caldor fire marks only the second time in California history that a wildfire crossed the Sierra Nevada, according to Cal Fire’s chief — the first was the Dixie fire just weeks ago.August is only the beginning of the usual wildfire season in California."}, {"title": "Hurricane Ida Leaves Over 1 Million Without Power, Could Be Weeks To Restore", "text": "Hurricane Ida left more than 1 million people without electricity and caused “catastrophic damage” in Louisiana and Mississippi as rescue teams began sifting through areas hit by raging winds and floodwaters on Monday, according to the White House.The “extremely large and powerful” hurricane made landfall in the Gulf Coast on Sunday, leaving massive destruction and flooding in its wake and destroying energy providers’ transmission systems, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki in a Monday briefing.It could take weeks to get power back in many areas, the White House said. This would leave people without refrigeration or air conditioning as temperatures are expected to stay in the high 80s this week.Rescue officials have begun searching in hard-hit areas across the state, but it appears New Orleans avoided disastrous levels of flooding last seen during Hurricane Katrina thanks to an upgraded system of levees meant to protect against fierce storms. More than $14 billion was spent on the network after it failed in 2005, and Ida presented one of the most dire tests of the levees since.Still, Ida left more than 300,000 people without access to clean water on Monday and about 2,000 were staying at shelters after evacuating their homes. At least three people have died, but Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said he expected that toll to rise “considerably” as rescue teams searched houses flooded by storm surges.Hurricane Ida is one of the most powerful hurricanes recorded in the United States. The storm notably left all of New Orleans without power, tearing through the area on the 16th anniversary of the deadly Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the region in 2005.Human-caused climate change contributes to storms becoming more powerful, according to climate researchers, with hurricanes bringing higher winds, releasing more rainfall and intensifying more quickly — leading to devastating consequences for affected communities.The communities most vulnerable to climate change — including those that experience slower recoveries in the aftermath of climate disasters — are disproportionately poor, Black and Latinx. Both Louisiana and Mississippi have disproportionately Black populations.Even as Ida has been downgraded to a tropical storm, it is expected to continue to produce heavy rainfall, and flooding remains a threat as the storm moves into other states, including Tennessee, warned the White House.More than 3,600 responders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been deployed to the region and are focusing on search and rescue, medical evacuations, providing emergency food and shelter, and restoring electrical power.Over 2,200 people have sought safety in dozens of shelters in Louisiana so far, The Associated Press reported. Those running emergency shelters are taking steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Psaki said.There has been a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases since July in both Louisiana, where only 41% of residents are fully vaccinated, and Mississippi, where only 38% of residents are fully vaccinated."}, {"title": "Photos Show Widespread Damage Across New Orleans, Wider Louisiana After Ida", "text": "Thousands of Louisianans woke up early Monday morning to widespread flooding and devastation in the wake of Hurricane Ida, one of the strongest storms to hit the United States mainland in history.In New Orleans, roads were blanketed with downed trees and roofing that had been stripped off buildings by Ida’s 120 mph winds.

Flash flood emergencies were issued south of New Orleans amid a failed levee, and thousands of people were under such orders until early Monday morning.“Take whatever means are necessary to protect your life,” the National Weather Service told Louisianans.New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents to remain at home, saying late Sunday conditions were still severe despite the storm weakening as it moved inland. It was too dangerous to be on the roads amid a citywide blackout, she added.“This is time to continue to remain in your safe places, not a time to venture out into our city at all,” Cantrell said. “It’s unsafe.”At least one person has died in Louisiana.

Ida’s 150-mph (230 kph) winds tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the mainland U.S. It dropped hours later to a Category 3 storm with maximum winds of 125 mph (200 kph) as it inched closer to New Orleans.The rising ocean swamped the barrier island of Grand Isle as landfall came just to the west at Port Fourchon. Ida made a second landfall about two hours later near Galliano. The hurricane was churning through the far southern Louisiana wetlands, with the more than 2 million people living in and around New Orleans and Baton Rouge under threat.“This is going to be much stronger than we usually see and, quite frankly, if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in Louisiana, it would be something very, very close to what we’re seeing,” Gov.

Engineers detected a “negative flow” on the Mississippi River as a result of storm surge, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ricky Boyette said.Edwards said he watched a live video feed from around Port Fourchon as Ida came ashore.“The storm surge is just tremendous. We can see the roofs have been blown off of the port buildings in many places,” Edwards told the AP.Officials said Ida’s swift intensification from a few thunderstorms to a massive hurricane in just three days left no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans’ 390,000 residents. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents remaining in the city on Sunday to “hunker down.”Marco Apostolico said he felt confident riding out the storm at his home in New Orleans’ Lower 9th Ward, one of the city’s hardest-hit neighborhoods when levees failed and released a torrent of floodwater during Katrina.His home was among those rebuilt with the help of actor Brad Pitt to withstand hurricane-force winds. But the memory of Katrina still hung over the latest storm.“It’s obviously a lot of heavy feelings,” he said. “And yeah, potentially scary and dangerous.”The region getting Ida’s worst includes petrochemical sites and major ports, which could sustain significant damage. It is also an area that is already reeling from a resurgence of COVID-19 infections due to low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant.New Orleans hospitals planned to ride out the storm with their beds nearly full, as similarly stressed hospitals elsewhere had little room for evacuated patients. And shelters for those fleeing their homes carried an added risk of becoming flashpoints for new infections.Forecasters warned winds stronger than 115 mph (185 kph) threatened Houma, a city of 33,000 that supports oil platforms in the Gulf.The hurricane was also threatening neighboring Mississippi, where Katrina demolished oceanfront homes. With Ida approaching, Claudette Jones evacuated her home east of Gulfport, Mississippi, as waves started pounding the shore.“I’m praying I can go back to a normal home like I left,” she said. “That’s what I’m praying for. But I’m not sure at this point.”Comparisons to the Aug. 29, 2005, landfall of Katrina weighed heavily on residents bracing for Ida. Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths as it caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans. Ida’s hurricane-force winds stretched 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the storm’s eye, or about half the size of Katrina, and a New Orleans’ infrastructure official emphasized that the city is in a “very different place than it was 16 years ago.”The levee system has been massively overhauled since Katrina, Ramsey Green, deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure, said before the worst of the storm hit. While water may not penetrate levees, Green said if forecasts of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain prove true, the city’s underfunded and neglected network of pumps, underground pipes and surface canals likely won’t be able to keep up.About 590,000 customers were already without power late Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide.The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was in contact with more than 1,500 oil refineries, chemical plants and other sensitive facilities and will respond to any reported pollution leaks or petroleum spills, agency spokesman Greg Langley said. He said the agency would deploy three mobile air-monitoring laboratories after the storm passes to sample, analyze and report any threats to public health.Louisiana’s 17 oil refineries account for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. refining capacity and its two liquefied natural gas export terminals ship about 55% of the nation’s total exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Government statistics show that 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast region was shut down as Ida made landfall on Sunday, according to energy company S&P Global Platts.Louisiana is also home to two nuclear power plants, one near New Orleans and another about 27 miles (about 43 kilometers) northwest of Baton Rouge.President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of Ida’s arrival. He said Sunday the country was praying for the best for Louisiana and would put its “full might behind the rescue and recovery” effort once the storm passes.Edwards warned his state to brace for potentially weeks of recovery.“Many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,” the governor told a news conference."}, {"title": "Woman Fights Off Mountain Lion Attacking Her Son Outside Their Los Angeles County Home", "text": "A California mom saved her 5-year-old son’s life when she repeatedly “punched” a mountain lion mauling the boy in the front yard of their home in Los Angeles County.The 65-pound juvenile big cat was killed later Thursday by wildlife wardens on the family’s property between Calabasas and Malibu.The boy was dragged by the mountain lion about 45 yards and suffered significant trauma to his head and upper body, but was in stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital on Saturday, The Associated Press reported.“The true hero of this story is his mom because she absolutely saved her son’s life,” Capt.

Katrina made landfall along the southeast Florida coast before gaining power over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, hitting land in Louisiana and again in Mississippi. The storm was credited for more than 1,800 deaths and $100 billion in damage.As was the case then, New Orleans is in the hurricane’s path. It is expected to make landfall as a Category 4 storm heading northwest before curving east over Mississippi and north toward West Virginia. Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 storm.Infrastructure improvements mean Louisiana will be better protected from storm surge. Where Katrina brought a 20-foot surge to parts of the coast, Ida is expected to bring less, up to 15 feet of water. Combined with rain and winds that are expected to exceed that of Katrina, Hurricane Ida has elected leaders and FEMA workers bracing for calamity.Edwards warned about the likelihood of flash flooding, calling it “a very real concern” because it “doesn’t take many hours of rain at the rate that they’re talking about before, that those rivers could be at flood stage.”“This is a very large storm,” he added."}, {"title": "Female Hummingbirds Who Look Like Males Avoid Harassment, Get More Time To Eat", "text": "Researchers have found that for females of one hummingbird species, looking more like males comes with a major benefit: being left alone.In young white-necked jacobins, a relatively large hummingbird that ranges from southern Mexico to parts of South America, both young males and females have bright blue feathers on their heads. As the birds get older, most females lose their flashy colors and develop more muted green and white coloring. But not all of them.About 20% of adult female birds in one population in Panama kept the bright blue plumage typically seen on adult males, according to the study, which was published in the journal Current Biology this week.To investigate what this might mean, researchers did a couple of things. They put tracking tags on some birds to monitor their feeding behavior. In a slightly more morbid turn, they also put out taxidermied birds to observe the reactions from live birds, CNN reports.They noticed a few things. For one, males had much more sexual interest in the dull-colored females. But males were also much more aggressive toward those females during feeding time, chasing, pecking and even body-slamming them, according to The New York Times. So the brighter-colored females ― the ones who looked like males ― got more time to eat without being bothered.“Our tests found that the typical, less colorful females were harassed much more than females with male-like plumage,” lead researcher Jay Falk of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology said in a news release. “Because the male-plumaged females experienced less aggression, they were able to feed more often ― a clear advantage.”This is a big deal, since hummingbirds need to eat constantly. An easier time feeding can make a huge difference in their survival.Falk told the Times that it’s still unclear what the mechanism is that allows some female birds to retain their bright colors into adulthood, but he hopes to do more research into it."}, {"title": "'Today Is It': Louisiana Braces For Menacing Hurricane Ida", "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Weather forecasters warned residents along Louisiana’s coast to rush preparations Saturday in anticipation of an intensifying Hurricane Ida, which is expected to bring winds as high as 140 mph (225 kph) when it slams ashore on Sunday.Authorities called a combination of voluntary and mandatory evacuations for cities and communities across the region. In New Orleans the mayor ordered a mandatory evacuation for areas outside the city’s levee system and a voluntary evacuation for residents inside the levee system. But since the storm quickly escalated in intensity, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said it was not possible to order a mandatory evacuation for the entire city, which would require using all lanes of some highways to leave the city.Traffic was heavy on westbound routes out of town early Saturday and gas stations were busy.The storm is expected to make landfall on the exact date Hurricane Katrina devastated a large swath of the Gulf Coast 16 years earlier. But whereas Katrina was a Category 3 when it made landfall southwest of New Orleans, Ida is expected to reach an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane, with top winds of 140 mph (225 kph) before making landfall likely west of New Orleans late Sunday.“Today is it,” Jamie Rhome, acting deputy director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami, said Saturday. “If you’re in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi, you really, really have to get going because today is it in terms of protecting life and property.”Ida intensified rapidly Friday from a tropical storm to a hurricane with top winds of 80 mph (128 kph) as it crossed western Cuba. It’s expected to pick up steam as it goes over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.On Saturday morning, Ida was centered 440 miles (710 kilometers) southeast of New Orleans. It was traveling northwest at 16 mph (26 kph), forecasters said. It’s maximum sustained winds had increased to 85 mph (140kph).In New Orleans, city officials said residents need to be prepared for prolonged power outages, and asked elderly residents to consider evacuating. Collin Arnold, the city’s emergency management director, said the city could be under high winds for about ten hours. Earlier Friday, Cantrell called for a mandatory evacuation for residents outside the city’s levee protections — a relatively small sliver of the city’s population.Ida would be the latest test of the New Orleans’ aging street drainage system. In a statement Friday, the city outlined steps it was taking to ensure that pumps were working and power sources to those pumps were ready. But, the amount of rain could be enough to overwhelm even a fully functional system.“We want to be clear, that with the amount of rain now forecasted, approximately 10 inches over the course of the event, it is likely that we will experience flooding,” the city said in a late Friday statement.Some ordinarily bustling businesses were closed Saturday. One popular breakfast spot was locked up tight with sandbags against the door to guard against flash floods.With the storm’s forward speed slowing down and the intensity picking up, the storm surge may overtop some levees that protect parts of New Orleans on the west bank of the Mississippi River, said Heath Jones, emergency manager, of the Army Corps of Engineers’ New Orleans District. However he said they are designed to be overtopped and have protections in place to prevent more damage. There does not appear to be any danger of storm surge coming over the levees that protect the city’s east bank, which makes up most of the city, he said.Across the region, residents were filling sandbags, getting gas for cars and generators and stocking up on food. Capt. Ross Eichorn, a fishing guide on the coast about 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, said he fears warm Gulf waters will “make a monster” out of Ida.“With a direct hit, ain’t no telling what’s going to be left — if anything,” Eichorn said. He added: “Anybody that isn’t concerned has got something wrong with them.”A hurricane warning was issued for most of the Louisiana coast from Intracoastal City to the mouth of the Pearl River. A tropical storm warning was extended to the Mississippi-Alabama line.At the same time hospitals are preparing for the storm, they are still dealing with a fourth surge of the coronavirus. Officials decided against evacuating New Orleans hospitals. There’s little room for their patients elsewhere, with hospitals from Texas to Florida already packed with patients, said Dr. Jennifer Avengo, the city’s health director.At the state’s largest hospital system, Ochsner Health System, officials ordered 10 days worth of fuel, food, drugs and other supplies and have backup fuel contracts for its generators. One positive was that the number of COVID-19 patients had dropped from 988 to 836 over the past week — a 15% decline.President Joe Biden approved a federal emergency declaration for Louisiana ahead of the storm. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said FEMA plans to send nearly 150 medical personnel and almost 50 ambulances to the Gulf Coast to assist strained hospitals.Ida made its first landfall Friday afternoon on Cuba’s southern Isle of Youth. The Cuban government issued a hurricane warning for its westernmost provinces, where forecasters said as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain could fall in places, possibly unleashing deadly flash floods and mudslides.

(AP) — Some 14,000 firefighters facing changing weather conditions battled more than a dozen large wildfires across California, including a growing blaze that was slowly pushing toward the Lake Tahoe resort region.Winds and temperatures were expected to pick up in coming days while humidity drops, adding to the challenges endured by crews working in rugged terrain.“That’s what’s closing the window of opportunity we’ve had to make progress and really get hold of the fire,” said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of the state firefighting agency.Flames churned through mountains just southwest of the Tahoe Basin, a home to thousands and recreational playground for millions of tourists who visit the alpine lake in summer, ski at the many resorts in winter and gamble at its casinos year-round.Johnny White and Lauren McCauley decided to flee their home in the mountains above Lake Tahoe once they could see flames on the webcam at their local ski resort.Even as ash rained down under a cloud of heavy smoke, the couple wasn’t panicked because they had an early warning Thursday to leave their home near Echo Summit, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of the lake, and wanted to avoid last-minute pandemonium if the wildfire continued its march toward the tourist destination on the California and Nevada border.“You don’t want everyone in the basin panicking and scrambling to try and leave at the same time,” McCauley said.Echo Summit, a mountain pass where cliff-hanging U.S. Route 50 begins its descent toward Lake Tahoe, is where firefighters plan to make their stand if the Caldor Fire keeps burning through dense forest in the Sierra Nevada.“Everything’s holding real good along Highway 50,” said Cal Fire Operations Section Chief Cody Bogan. “The fire has been backing down real slowly ... we’ve just been allowing it to do it on its own speed. It’s working in our favor.”The fire is one of nearly 90 large blazes in the U.S. There were more than a dozen big fires in California, including one that destroyed 18 homes in Southern California, which has so far escaped the scale of wildfires plaguing the north all summer.A new fire broke out Thursday in the Sierra foothills forcing evacuations near the historic Gold Rush town of Sonora, just dozens of miles from Yosemite National Park.Fires in California have destroyed around 2,000 structures and forced thousands to evacuate while also blanketing large swaths of the West in unhealthy smoke.Climate change has made the West warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.The Caldor Fire has been the nation’s top firefighting priority because of its proximity to Lake Tahoe, where its tourist economy should be in full swing this time of year.“This is the week before Labor Day weekend — a busy weekend, normally,” South Lake Tahoe City Manager Joe Irvin said. “That is not going to be the case this year.”The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted in a report on the fire that “social, political, and economic concerns will increase as the fire progresses toward the Lake Tahoe Basin.” The agency did not immediately respond to a request to elaborate beyond that statement.Visitors are still crowding the highway that loops the massive lake and riding bikes and walking the beaches, but many are wearing masks. The lake, known for its water clarity and the granite peaks that surround it, has been shrouded in dense smoke that has reached hazardous levels.The Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority reversed its advice from earlier in the week and recommended tourists postpone their travel. Previously the group that promotes tourism on the south side of the lake advised letting visitors decide whether to cancel their trips amid smoke and approaching fire.Carol Chaplin, the president and CEO, said hotels and lodges were in lockstep with public safety officials.“They understand that this is not the experience that their guests are used to or look forward to,” she said.Irvin issued an emergency proclamation Thursday so the city that’s home to Heavenly Ski Resort can be better prepared if evacuation orders come and be reimbursed for related expenses.The last time the city declared a wildfire emergency was during the 2007 Angora Fire, which destroyed nearly 250 homes in neighboring Meyers and was the last major fire in the basin.Not far from the neighborhood that was largely wiped out in that fire, residents hurried to clear pine cones and needles from their roofs and gutters to prepare for the possibility of fire.The Angora Fire, which was driven by strong winds and took residents by surprise, burned just 3,100 acres, fewer than 5 square miles (13 square kilometers).The Caldor Fire has burned nearly 144,000 acres — or 225 square miles (583 square kilometers) — and remained only 12% contained early Friday.Retired fire district captain Joe McAvoy, who lost his own home in the fire, said wildfires larger than 100,000 acres were once-in-a-lifetime events in his career. Not anymore.“Now it seems like they’re all 100,000 acres,” McAvoy said. It’s way more extreme. ... Now (fires) are 100,000 acres and it’s like, ‘Oh, yeah, big deal.’ You know, it’s every fire.”___Melley reported from Los Angeles.

Since protocetids were amphibious, they represent a unique period in whale evolution that largely still remains a mystery.But the researchers behind the study believe the newly discovered fossil offers clues as to how whales transformed from land dwellers to the sea creatures we know today.“All known protocetid whales had well-developed, non-reduced fore and hind limbs that could bear the animals’ weight outside of water, albeit probably awkwardly, as these animals were probably quite heavy,” Robert W. Boessenecker, co-author of the study, told HuffPost. “Think of seals and sea lions, for example.”What sets this four-legged creature apart from other protocetid whales is an impressively murderous, jackal-like jaw that allowed it to have a “raptorial feeding style,” according to the study. The researchers, who analyzed the fossil at Mansoura University, named the species “Phiomectus anubis” after Anubis, the jackal-headed Egyptian god of death.“We discovered how fierce and deadly its powerful jaws are capable of tearing a wide range of prey ... this whale was a god of death to most of the animals that lived in its area,” Abdullah Gohar, lead author of the paper, told Insider.Despite how terrifying this carnivorous lord of demise may sound, the report said it’s only a “medium-sized” protocetid, which translates to about 10 feet in length and a weight of around 1,300 pounds.The fossil was found in the Fayum Depression in Egypt’s Western Desert, which was once submerged underwater. German paleontologist Eberhard Fraas dug up some of the first protocetids in the region in the early 1900s, and many others have been discovered there since."}, {"title": "The Gassing Of Satartia", "text": "Carbon dioxide has long been used to euthanize laboratory rodents and other small animals, a practice animal welfare organizations now consider inhumane due to the suffering the gas inflicts on the animals. Each year, CO2 accidents kill about 100 workers worldwide — often in basements of restaurants that use CO2-charged systems for their bar mixers — or in industrial accidents.Carbon dioxide is an asphyxiant that displaces ambient oxygen, making it more difficult to breathe. Smaller exposures cause coughing, dizziness and a panicky feeling called “air hunger.” As CO2 concentrations get higher and exposure times longer, the gas causes a range of effects from unconsciousness to coma to death. Even at lower levels, CO2 can act as an intoxicant, impairing cognitive performance and inducing a confused, drunken-like state.Denbury’s entire business is built around piping carbon dioxide to oilfields and a few industrial users in two operational centers in the Gulf Coast and the Rockies. It owns or has an interest in 14 oil fields in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, which are connected by five CO2 pipelines spanning 925 miles. Among its properties is Tinsley Field, adjacent to Satartia, which became Mississippi’s first commercially successful oil field in 1939.In 2007, Denbury built its 31-mile Delta pipeline to connect Tinsley to the Jackson Dome, an extinct volcano under Jackson, Mississippi, whose 4.6 trillion cubic feet of naturally occurring CO2 gas supplies all of the company’s fields. Denbury extended the Delta line 77 miles to Louisiana’s Delhi field in 2009.Denbury uses the CO2 for enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, which uses the gas to flush more oil out of wells. About 20% to 40% of the oil in a field can be recovered through conventional drilling and injecting water into the reservoir. Injecting CO2 after that can increase the yield up to 60%.CO2 use in oil fields has resulted in accidents in several states and abroad. Tinsley itself suffered a sizeable CO2 “blowout” ― where injected CO2 explodes out of the ground along with water, mud and drilling fluids ― in 2011 that took 37 days to bring under control, sickened one worker, and killed deer, birds, fish and other animals.Denbury had already had two other blowouts in Mississippi, one requiring the evacuation of local homes in Amite County in 2007. Another underground CO2 blowout at Delhi field in 2013 lasted for more than six weeks and contaminated the air with unsafe levels of both CO2 and methane.Denbury and other companies that do EOR are well versed in the dangers of CO2. At Denbury’s Heidelberg Field in eastern Mississippi, signs warn of a CO2 hazard and say SCBA must be worn, and there are muster stations where workers gather if there is a release. The company also has safety pamphlets on its website ― one for the public called “Pipeline Safety Is Everybody’s Responsibility” and another for first responders titled, “AWARE: Tactics for Responding to a CO2 Pipeline Leak.” None of the emergency workers interviewed for this story had seen either.While the risks of CO2 exposure were well established, the Satartia gassing was the first known instance of an outdoor mass exposure to piped CO2 gas anywhere in the world, according to Marcelo Korc, chief of the World Health Organization’s Climate Change and Environmental Determinants of Health Unit, whose staff researched injuries from CO2 pipeline leaks in response to an inquiry from HuffPost.Korc’s staff also found that CO2 from the Jackson Dome is contaminated with hydrogen sulfide, a deadly gas that likely worsened residents’ symptoms and also accounts for the gas cloud’s odor and greenish color, since pure CO2 is odorless and colorless.Denbury declined to answer specific questions for this story, sending only a statement:On February 22, 2020, at approximately 7:00 p.m., Denbury Enterprises’ Delta pipeline experienced a sudden rupture and release of CO2 gas near Satartia, Mississippi. Before, during, and after the event, Denbury’s main interest has been the health and safety of the residents in the vicinity of the release and the surrounding environment. Denbury and its personnel were quickly in the community, working directly with nearby leadership and any individual residents affected by the event to ensure that any needs arising from the event were met. We have continued to work closely with the community and have made significant contributions to local emergency response organizations to support the important role they play in keeping the community safe. Denbury has cooperated fully with all federal, state, and local agencies who responded to the incident. The federal agency charged with regulating the pipeline continues its review and investigation of the incident, and Denbury continues to cooperate fully with their efforts.Beyond the suffering of those who lived through it, the fact that the Biden administration is poised to commit unprecedented billions to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology — putting CCS at the center of the country’s strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — further magnifies the importance of Satartia’s CO2 accident.The historic hike in federal support for CCS infrastructure includes taking the first steps toward the construction of a continent-spanning network of pipelines in order to move America’s many millions of tons of CO2 to storage areas where, theoretically, the gas can be injected deep underground and sequestered indefinitely.Some experts estimate this network will need to be as large as or even larger than the 2.6 million miles of existing petroleum pipelines. Meanwhile, there are only 5,000 miles of existing CO2 lines, meaning there is little experience with a wide range of operational — and safety — issues likely to arise from such a massive new system.Nevertheless, Biden’s climate team; his Department of Energy and three of its former secretaries; most utilities; the coal industry and the governments of several coal states; ExxonMobil, the rest of Big Oil and other major industrial corporations; several climate NGOs; the AFL-CIO; and a bipartisan group that spans both houses of Congress all support CCS and the pipeline expansion in some form.“We want to build more pipes,” DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm told a reporter in June. “There’s a lot of jobs that are associated with decarbonizing ... and I think pipes are one of those opportunities.”But the rush to build and operate an integrated CCS and pipeline system has so far taken place with little examination of the safety issue, as the people of Satartia learned.Korc of the WHO worried that the basic science done long ago on many toxic chemicals, including petroleum products, has never been done for CO2.“The exposure studies simply don’t exist,” he said.​​Satartia was, in effect, an unwitting case study for a monumental project.DeEmmeris Burns was returning to his mother’s house in Satartia from a fishing trip with his brother Andrew Burns and cousin Victor Lewis when they heard an explosion and then a deafening roar, like a jet engine. The stench of rotten eggs filled the car.DeEmmeris Burns immediately thought: pipeline explosion. He knew there was one nearby, but other than its approximate location, knew nothing else about it.They were driving on Perry Creek Road, a gravel and dirt country lane that hugs its namesake waterway and passes close to but below the location of the pipe rupture. They were almost at his mother’s house.He called his mother’s cellphone at 7:18 p.m. and told her there had been a gas explosion.“You got to get out. We’re close, we’re coming to get you,” Burns shouted over the roar of escaping gas.On the other end of the call, 65-year-old Thelma Brown was trying to figure out why her son sounded so strange. He was hollering, breathing heavily, not making sense. She knew the pipeline he was talking about; it runs about half a mile from her house. But she hadn’t smelled anything. She heard her son frantically repeating, “Cut the air! Cut everything off! Cut the air!” And then, silence.She tried calling him back. No answer. She rang the other two men’s cell phones, but got nothing.Inside the car, the three men rolled up the windows to keep out whatever it was they were driving through. Then the engine died.“Hunh,” Burns said. “Car shut off.”Minutes later, Thelma’s sister, Linda Garrett, who lived just down the road, smelled the gas and called too. Thelma repeated what her sons had told her before their call dropped.Garrett hung up with Thelma and called 911, but the dispatcher didn’t seem to know about a gas leak.“Do I need to be getting out of here?” Garrett asked. The 911 operator said she’d call her back and let her know.Garrett noticed her own breathing was becoming labored. Then her daughter Lynett Garrett and 14-year-old granddaughter, Makaylan Burns, who had been out picking up a pizza for dinner, staggered in the door.Makaylan seemed to be in full-blown respiratory distress, and Lynett was unable to talk. She pounded on the dining room table and panted.“What is it? What’s wrong? What is it?” Garrett shouted.Makaylan dropped to the floor, unconscious.Garrett tried 911 again. This time the operator acknowledged that there was a gas leak.“They have shut the highway down because of it. They’re not letting anyone in, they can’t come evacuate y’all,” she said.Garrett was afraid if they left the house, all three of them would pass out. She insisted on an ambulance. The dispatcher said one would meet them outside of town.Garrett and Lynett carried Makaylan out to the car. Garrett had a bad back and both adults were having trouble breathing, but they managed to get the teenager into the back seat, still unconscious.Lynett drove and Garrett stayed on the phone with 911 as the operator told them the best route out of town. But after a few minutes, Garrett’s breath “just cut out.” “We ain’t going to make it,’’ she said, before she blacked out. Lynett drove to where they were supposed to meet the ambulance, but it didn’t show up, and she had to drive to the hospital.Back at her house, Thelma Brown ran outside to round up her 8- and 3-year-old grandchildren. She brought them into her bedroom, along with her 2-month-old grandson. The oldest, who has asthma but hadn’t suffered an attack for some time, was having trouble breathing, so she gave him his albuterol inhaler. She gave some to the 3-year-old too, since she had been outside. Brown closed the windows and blocked air from coming in under the door with a wet towel.Other relatives called, urging her to get out. But her pickup had a flat, and she was alone with three children. Her daughter was supposed to come get the kids after work, but called and told Brown that all the roads into the area were blocked off. Garrett told Brown what 911 had told her: that emergency workers were not coming into town to evacuate victims.“I talked to the Lord. I said, ‘Lord, me and these kids going to bed,’” recalled Brown. “And I said, ‘We’re going to stay here until somebody comes and gets us out of here.’”She waited for her son and the others to show up. She fell asleep.At the same time, a group of friends were cooking crayfish and sipping beer at a fishing camp along the Yazoo River. It was getting dark when Hugh Martin noticed the rotten egg smell. Soon they were all wheezing and breathing hard. Martin’s friend, Casey Sanders, collapsed onto the ground, then quickly came to.Coughing and choking, everyone somehow made it to their vehicles. Martin jumped into his white pickup truck and drove up onto the levee that separates the town from the river. The glare of his headlights illuminated a green, misty fog. The suffocating feeling was nearly intolerable. “Only thing I been through worse than this was the gas chamber when I was in the Army training for Desert Storm,” he said. “And that was CS gas.” CS gas is a type of tear gas.He called his elderly mother, Marguerite Vinson, who told him she was feeling dizzy.“Got your shoes on, mama?” he asked, trying to keep the anxiety out of his voice. He told her to meet him in the carport of their home, not far from the fishing camp. After stopping once to throw up out of the truck window, he made it home.“I saw mama standing there, holding her phone, and she was weak at the knees. And I just grabbed her and throwed her in the truck,” said Martin. “Then I just took off and headed for the highway.”At the stop sign at Route 3 was a checkpoint, but he blew by it, heading north to the hospital in Yazoo City. His mother lay motionless on the passenger’s seat: Her eyes were open, but she stared blankly ahead when he spoke to her.At the hospital, he found others from the crayfish cook, including Casey Sanders, and learned that her teenage son, Nathan Weston Sanders, and his girlfriend were missing, after leaving the fishing camp minutes before the explosion.The girlfriend had called in a panic ― their pickup was dead, and Nathan Weston Sanders had collapsed. She couldn’t revive him and didn’t know where they were. Now, Sanders’ father and another man from the crayfish gathering were driving back into the fog to look for them.Sheriff’s Officer Terry Gann was at a grocery store, taking a break from a long day working a double homicide when he received an EMS alert about a motorist who had a seizure due to a “green fog” crossing Route 433 east of the town.Yazoo is Mississippi’s biggest county at 923 square miles, but it’s an economically disadvantaged one, with just 11 sheriff’s officers who get called in for everything from tornadoes and floods to industrial accidents. Even though he is the county’s only criminal investigator, Gann works the disasters too. At 7:32 p.m., he headed toward Satartia in his truck.EMS advised responders that self-contained breathing apparatus was required to enter the “hot zone” inside the roadblocks, where the gas had settled. Gann didn’t have SCBA with him, but he went in anyway.At the command post south of Satartia on Route 3, a man told Gann his daughter had gone missing in the gas plume, not far from the ruptured pipe. The cloud was moving slowly northwest, so first Gann took the road over the levee to enter the village from the south to evacuate any remaining residents.He did a round of checks on houses, banging on doors and peering through windows, but found no one. Around him he saw ― and felt ― the cloud. “It’s like I just ran a mile as fast as I could. My ears were popping. My face was burning like a sunburn.”His pickup also started to choke on the fumes. He raced back over the Yazoo River, out of the cloud, to catch his breath and get the vehicle running, then returned to check more houses. Just outside of town, he found a young man and woman pacing the middle of an intersection.“It was almost like something you’d see in a zombie movie. They were just walking in circles,” he said. “I kept telling ’em, ‘Y’all get in the truck.’ And they would just look at me with this blank look on their face. And the girl was holding a phone up to her head but she wasn’t saying nothing. ... Finally I just yelled at ’em, I said, ‘Get in the truck or you’re gonna die!’”Gann shoved the dazed teenagers into the back seat, not knowing it was Nathan Weston Sanders and his girlfriend.After picking up a woman he found unresponsive in a stalled car, his engine began sputtering again, so he returned to the command post to meet the ambulance. By the time they got there, Gann himself could barely breathe and had to be given oxygen.He did one last search of Satartia, then messaged dispatch, “Everyone evacuated” at 9 p.m. He radioed that he was heading for Perry Creek Road, which hadn’t yet been searched.That worried Jack Willingham, director of Yazoo County Emergency Management Agency, since Gann had been breathing high levels of CO2 for nearly two hours and was panting audibly over the radio. His speech was often slurred and when it wasn’t, it didn’t always make sense. Willingham ordered Gann to leave the “hot zone” immediately and get medical attention.But Gann, disoriented by the lack of oxygen, got lost and never made it to Perry Creek. With radio guidance, he met an ambulance that took him to a hospital in Yazoo City. After two hours of oxygen treatments, he went home, utterly spent.By then, however, a three-man team of Vicksburg firefighters was on its way to Perry Creek Road.They were driving a UTV, or utility task vehicle, a small ATV-like two-seater with an open cargo bed in back that held spare air bottles and tools. Jerry Briggs, fire coordinator for Warren County, squatted in the cargo area with Warren County 911 director Shane Garrard, while Lamar Frederick, a Vicksburg fire chief, drove. Each wore 60 pounds of fire protective clothing and gear, including SCBA.After making their own fruitless search of the village, they decided that rather than return empty handed, they would enter the blast area via Perry Creek Road. The roar of the ruptured pipeline was deafening as they approached.A half mile up Perry Creek Road, they saw a car with its lights on and windows up just as the UTV began stalling.“We got victims,” Frederick yelled above the roar.Inside the small red Cadillac sedan were three men: DeEmmeris and Andrew Burns, and Victor Lewis. DeEmmeris Burns lay across the backseat in the fetal position. The other two were slumped against the windows, white foam coming out of their noses and mouths, their clothes stained with urine and excrement. The firemen thought they were too late.The doors were stuck, so Briggs smashed the right rear window. The three were still breathing, though just barely. The rescuers shook them and tried sternum rubs, but got no reaction.Panting in exhaustion and sweating under all their gear, they managed to get all three out and cram them into the UTV.They headed toward the south command post. After a few minutes of fresh air, the victims began to stir. Then they tried to stand up. They seemed about to fall off when a truck full of county deputies met up with the UTV, and one of the deputies bear-hugged the men into place until they met the ambulance.The firemen had just a few minutes to breath fresh air and chug water before Willingham sent them to evacuate a group of mostly elderly residents just across the river. Willingham and the National Weather Service office in Jackson were tracking the plume as it headed northwest, and Willingham was determined to get ahead of it.By now, six Denbury officials had arrived on the scene along with Denbury’s air monitoring contractor, the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health; the environmental remediation firm E3; an investigator for the federal Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA); and officials from the Mississippi’s Emergency Management Agency and Department of Environmental Quality.At 11:06 p.m., the Denbury team “observed no product coming from the failure location,” according Denbury’s report to PHMSA. The leak was officially declared over.Once the province of a few policy wonks and coal companies, shipping carbon dioxide and storing it underground has gotten much more mainstream attention in recent years amid a tsunami of conferences, draft legislation and interest groups.The fossil fuel industry has gotten behind CCS as a technology that, it hopes, would allow continued production so long as the emissions are buried underground. But the immense network of pipelines needed to transport carbon dioxide to locations where it would be stored deep below ground weren’t discussed publicly until recently, nor was how such a rapid, unprecedented pipeline buildout could be done.A much-touted December 2020 Princeton University study ― funded in part by the oil industry ― calls for a 65,000-mile system by 2050, which means adding 60,000 miles to the current 5,000 miles of CO2 pipeline. The new system would be organized into a spider web of continent-spanning trunk lines as large as 4′ in diameter — twice the size of the Satartia pipeline — fed by a system of smaller spur lines.But even 65,000 miles of pipeline could only move 15% of current U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. To have any effect on climate change “would entail CO2 pipeline capacity larger than the existing petroleum pipeline system,” which totals 2.6 million miles, according to a 2020 study in Biophysical Economics and Sustainability.Beginning with the Bush administration, the U.S. government has spent over $8 billion to promote carbon capture and storage (CCS). But almost all of the CO2 in current pipelines is used for enhanced oil recovery rather than being injected deep into the earth for secure geologic storage, and enhanced oil recovery produces more emissions than it sequesters. Almost none of today’s CO2 is manmade, but comes from natural sources like the Jackson Dome.Proposals like Princeton’s would likely require extending CO2 pipelines into heavily populated areas, across mountains and other natural barriers. The cost of such an enormous system is driving some to suggest simply repurposing existing natural gas pipelines to move CO2.But because CO2 is corrosive and will eat through the carbon steel used in petroleum pipelines if contaminated with even small amounts of water, CO2 pipelines have to be manufactured to a higher standard and the purity of the gas carefully monitored. And research shows that CO2 from a commonly used carbon capture technique is particularly likely to have water in it. CO2 pipelines also run at significantly higher pressures than natural gas pipelines, which in turn requires more energy-gobbling compressor stations along the line to keep the CO2 in a liquid state.That’s why a 2019 National Petroleum Council report warned against using existing natural gas pipelines to move CO2. The American Petroleum Institute has also highlighted the risks.Yet an influential white paper produced jointly by the Energy Futures Initiative, headed by former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and the AFL-CIO proposes doing just that. “Repurposing the expansive U.S. network of existing oil and gas pipelines presents a ripe opportunity to lower costs for CO2 transport,” said the report.Moniz was Biden’s energy adviser in his 2020 presidential campaign, and oversaw billions in spending on CCS in his time at the Department of Energy. He and his team are considered leading experts on both natural gas and carbon dioxide infrastructure. Yet the petroleum industry’s own longstanding warnings about mixing gas technology with carbon dioxide are nowhere to be found in a 79-page report or its 299 footnotes.“So much of it is about cost cutting, finding ways to do things cheaper and where can you make compromises,” said Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law and co-author of a highly critical report on CCS and pipelines.Muffett noted that CO2 behaves differently from natural gas inside a pipeline — in ways that make a CO2 rupture uniquely dangerous.“Because of the intense pressures involved, explosive decompression of a CO2 pipeline releases more gas, more quickly, than an equivalent explosion in a gas pipeline,” noted a report by CIEL and the Environmental Working Group, and “even a modest rupture can spread freezing CO2 over a wide area within seconds.”A complicating factor in the Satartia accident was the presence of hydrogen sulfide. A Mississippi Emergency Management Agency email from the night of the accident said the leak contained an “unknown amount of pressurized CO2 with H2S.” CO2 is often contaminated with hydrogen sulfide, and Muffett points out that not only does H2S increase the corrosiveness of CO2, but it has serious health effects that can include damage to the nervous system, lungs, liver and heart.Even CO2 by itself, however, can be quite lethal. On a summer day in 1986, a thick plume of CO2 from a volcanic lake in Cameroon killed 1,746 people. Birds dropped out of the sky and whole families died together in minutes.Short of death, however, there is a wide range of CO2 inhalation effects, which include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, memory disturbances, lack of concentration, disorientation, convulsions, and unconsciousness ― symptoms that closely track those of Satartia’s gassing victims.Unfortunately, few emergency rooms are familiar with the range of its effects.When DeEmmeris Burns woke up, he was sitting in a chair near a nurse’s station. He had no idea how he got to the hospital.An IV was running down his arm, and his brother and cousin were in adjoining chairs. His lungs burned and his head ached. He was still in his soiled clothes.“They didn’t put us in rooms. I mean, it was just all bad,” he remembered. “The nurses weren’t prepared for this.”The hospitals told HuffPost that they responded appropriately under standard protocols for a mass toxic incident, but would not comment on specific cases.At around 12:30 a.m., Sarah Belk, who had grown up with the Burns brothers, found the three sitting in chairs, wrapped in a single blanket. Belk had brought her own mother and daughter to the ER after they escaped from Sataria.Andrew Burns asked where they were, and she told them they were at the hospital in Vicksburg, that their car stalled in the cloud of gas, and they’d been found unconscious. They were shivering “like they were in shock,” Belk said.She saw their stained clothes and the dried foam on their faces. All three were thirsty. No one was attending to them, and the nurses seemed dismissive and rude, Belk said.“I felt that they were not realizing the extent of what was going on with these people,” she said.Belk’s 16-year-old daughter, Ellie, had thrown up, and was still red-faced from the lack of air during her escape from Satartia. Belk’s 57-year-old mother, who has COPD, was also struggling to breathe, and after more than an hour of gas exposure, her complexion “was gray.” But Belk said she still struggled to get them oxygen or basic attention. The hospital seemed overwhelmed.Belk let the three men borrow her phone to call their families.“I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’” Berneva Lewis, Victor Lewis’ mother, remembered. “‘We’re at the hospital.’ That’s all they could tell me on the phone. I’m like, ‘What happened?’ They’re like, ‘They said we were in gas.’”Given how disoriented they were, Lewis was startled to get a call at 2 a.m. saying the men were being released. “It was ridiculous. They were out before I could even get to the hospital,” she said.Another relative picked them up at the hospital and drove them to Victor Lewis’ father’s home in Vicksburg. They were still in the same clothes they’d worn upon arrival.Of some 49 gassing victims who went to the hospital, almost all were treated at Merit Health River Region in Vicksburg or Baptist Memorial Hospital in Yazoo City. But the victims say neither facility seemed prepared for how to deal with this kind of disaster. In response to questions from HuffPost, both hospitals acknowledged they based treatment on standard toxic event protocols, which included setting up unheated outdoor decontamination tents to undress and wash victims ― despite temperatures in the low 40s that day.Neither hospital said they’d received any special training in handling a CO2 pipeline incident. Medical records for four gassing victims treated at Baptist Memorial — and for six of those from Merit River Region, including the Burns brothers and Lewis — seem to reflect confusion about what they were exposed to.“Asphyxiation by environmental toxic gas, accidental or unintentional initial encounter. CO2, H2S, chlorine gas exposure from ruptured gas line,” reads the report for all four of the Baptist patients. Later the records cite “natural gas exposure.”“They [were] nowhere near ready for something like that to happen,” Hugh Martin said. “They were understaffed, but they also didn’t know what the hell they were dealing with.”Denbury knew about the accident before anyone. At 7:07 p.m., a low pressure alarm at its Texas headquarters alerted the company that the pipeline was leaking, and the company closed the main operating valves for the Satartia section of the line at 7:15 p.m., according to Denbury’s incident report to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).The report claimed that the company promptly notified local emergency responders, but both Fire Chief Durward Pettis and county Emergency Management Director Jack Willingham said nobody called them.Denbury had no contact with them until Pettis called the company at about 7:45 p.m., according to the Yazoo County emergency dispatch log, and even then provided no guidance on the response or how to treat CO2 inhalation victims.Without that guidance, 911 operators told callers there had been a natural gas pipeline rupture. But natural gas and CO2 are quite different. Natural gas is lighter than air, travels straight up, and is highly flammable. Exposure to CO2 mixed with hydrogen sulfide, on the other hand, can cause death from asphyxiation as well as lung damage. Residents of Sartaria were given no information about how to respond to such a mixture.In the weeks that followed, Denbury also appears not to have disclosed the extent of the pipeline breach to investors.“The affected pipeline segment was [isolated] within minutes of detection,” Denbury’s Senior Vice President of Operations David Sheppard said during a Feb. 25 quarterly earnings call. “And as a precaution, the area surrounding the leak site was evacuated, including residents of the small nearby town of Satartia. No injuries to local residents, our employees, our contractors were reported in association with the leak.”To date, that is Denbury’s most detailed public statement on the CO2 pipeline leak. Its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission make no mention of a pipeline accident or leak, the evacuation, the injuries to residents, or any other details. Its 2021 annual report made two oblique references to the explosion, noting an oil production decline in 2020 at its Delhi, Louisiana, oil field “due to the lack of CO2 purchases between late-February and late-October 2020 as a result of the Delta-Tinsley CO2 pipeline being down for repair during that period” and “$4.3 million of costs associated with the Delta-Tinsley CO2 pipeline repair.”Denbury did disclose a total of 46 hospitalizations and 200 evacuees — the latter a little lower than the number reported by other sources — in its incident report to PHMSA.Denbury also did not disclose that on Oct. 7, 2020, there was another accident while reconnecting the damaged pipeline section. While workers did a “controlled blow-down” to remove any remaining CO2 from the section, a valve “froze in the open position due to internal ice formation” and gas poured out, according to Denbury’s report to the state Department of Environmental Quality. Multiple attempts to close it failed, and some residents had to be evacuated that night on short notice. But the second incident lasted longer ― almost an entire day― and released 41,000 barrels of CO2, according to Denbury, while the Feb. 22 incident lasted four hours and released 31,407 barrels.Why the pipeline initially ruptured also has yet to be determined. A PHMSA spokesman declined to comment on when its official report on the incident might be released.Meanwhile, Denbury sent a section of the pipeline to a metallurgical lab for testing. Based on those findings and its contention that the pipeline was “code compliant,” it theorized in its report to PHMSA that soil movement caused by persistent heavy rains “induced axial stresses” that caused a rupture.Heavy rains beginning in late January 2020 did cause widespread flooding and evacuations along the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers. But Chad Jones, a plaintiff’s lawyer representing gassing victims who is also a geologist, said flooding is common in the Delta, and should have been anticipated when the pipeline was built in 2007. Jones noted several other factors that should have been taken into account during construction as well: the soil in the area, called loess, is unstable and prone to shifting and mudslides, and building a pipeline through such soil requires special techniques because any rupture in that area would send the gas downhill into Satartia.“They might claim an act of God,” said Jones, “but I mean, we can prove that it wasn’t.”Denbury Resources filed for bankruptcy five months after the incident, citing the pandemic crash in oil prices. It emerged from Chapter 11 in September 2020 after shedding $2.1 billion in debt and its old name. In March 2021, the newly restructured Denbury Inc. gave a presentation at the 26th Annual Credit Suisse Energy Summit recounting highlights of 2020, including “record levels of safety performance for the fourth consecutive year.”Among the new capital investments for 2021 that Denbury CEO Chris Kendall and other officials unveiled was a $7 million plan boosting CO2-based drilling operations in the Tinsley field — using the same pipeline that ruptured in 2020.Officer Terry Gann got three hours of sleep before heading back to Satartia.Abandoned vehicles were everywhere ― doors ajar, many with their windows smashed from the rescue efforts. Gann had the keys to several, and rescuers set up a kind of lost and found on the side of the road.Gann helped Denbury personnel, including technicians with gas measuring equipment, escort villagers back to their homes. The rotten egg odor was still heavy in the air.As soon as Linda Garrett and her family walked in her kitchen door, the technician’s gas meter hit the red zone, and they had to leave until levels went down.That evening, Satartia Mayor Kathy Nesbit, Pettis and several Denbury representatives presided over a standing-room-only meeting at First Baptist Church. Bruce Augustine, Denbury’s operations manager, told the crowd that the company was “very happy that the air monitoring we’ve done shows that everyone can now return to their homes.”Denbury officials said they would be stationed at the town hall to deal with any problems or complaints, and that residents would be promptly reimbursed for medical bills. While there was some discussion of safety measures to prevent a repeat disaster, nothing definite was promised.Nesbit, an intensive care nurse who had been working at River Region hospital the night before, tried to dispel fears of long-term health effects. “It is a natural chemical in our bodies,” she said. “So it’s not a poison that’s going to infiltrate you and eventually kill you.”That was cold comfort to many survivors, some of whom noted pointedly that Nesbit hadn’t been in town that night and didn’t experience being inside the plume.When it was over, Thelma Brown and Berneva Lewis thanked Vicksburg firefighters Jerry Briggs and Shane Garrard for saving their sons. “That was when they actually told us about the condition that the guys were in and how they were very near death and foaming at the mouth,” Brown said.DeEmmeris and Andrew Burns and Victor Lewis were still in no shape to go to any meetings. After a sleepless night, more vomiting and severe headaches, they spent early Sunday on oxygen, being monitored and having bloodwork done at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, the state’s flagship teaching hospital. Even after that, Lewis told his mother, who is a nurse, that he still felt terrible.She took all three to another doctor the next day, and tests revealed that their blood CO2 levels were still alarmingly high. The doctor said they would need to remain on oxygen until the numbers came down, and sent them to a pulmonologist.Denbury called victims to ask whether they needed anything and reimbursed medical bills quickly. Residents were asked to drop by Town Hall to discuss compensation for other losses, like pain and suffering. Those who accepted were paid on the spot, but waived their right to sue or discuss the settlement.But many victims, some of whom say they are still sick, anxious and unable to fully return to their previous lives, weren’t interested in a deal and decided to sue. The Burns brothers and Lewis hired Robert Gibbs, a well known lawyer from Jackson. Their suit will claim Denbury failed to properly maintain the pipeline or take necessary safety precautions to prevent exposure to hazardous gas, Gibbs said.Another who decided to sue was Martin, whose occasional breathing difficulties from mild COPD have required much more frequent use of his inhaler since the February 2020 incident.Medical records also show that months after the incident, his 78-year-old mother, who had no previous history of breathing difficulties, was using albuterol constantly, getting oxygen treatments, and had to be hospitalized for a week in March 2020 after he found her lying unresponsive in bed and having trouble breathing.Marguerite Vinson was frustrated that not only was she not recovering, she seemed to be getting sicker.“I can’t think half-right! And I just wear out. Anything I try to do, it’s hard to do if it requires exertion,” she said.Linda Garrett said Denbury asked to meet with her three weeks after the incident and offered her a package deal — $5,000 each for her, her daughter and granddaughter, which she refused. She said she heard one neighbor, who is white, had been offered $10,000, and that another white neighbor had been given $18,000 compensation for cows that miscarried after the incident.“They value a cow more than they do a human,” Garrett said.Gibbs’ three clients, however, did get some extra attention from Denbury.Not long after the gassing, DeEmmeris Burns’ phone rang. According to Burns, the voice on the other end identified himself as Denbury CEO Chris Kendall.“He asked me ‘How’s everything going?’” said Burns. “I just told him I’ve got someone talking for me now.”Over a year and a half after the gassing incident, the Burns brothers and Lewis still have not returned to work. They were under a doctor’s care until February 2021, when they were taken off oxygen, said Gibbs. DeEmmeris Burns moved out of his mother’s house because, he said, it’s too painful for him to drive up Perry Creek Road.Gibbs said his and some nine other law firms representing the Satartia CO2 plaintiffs have joined forces as the Denbury Litigation Group. While Gibbs represents only the three Perry Creek Road victims, some lawyers have as many as 60 or 70 clients. None has yet filed suit, awaiting the long-delayed Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration report on the reasons for the accident.Martin said he hopes a lawsuit will pry out all the facts about what happened that night and why.“If there’s this many malfunctions in that one section of pipeline, somebody was at fault, or they were passing inspections they shouldn’t have passed,” said Martin. “That’s what we need to find out.”Nevertheless, opinions differ as to how or even whether Denbury should be held accountable. One reason may be an inherent reluctance to criticize the oil and gas industry, a source of scarce well-paid jobs as well as a statewide political power. Some are willing to consider the pipeline rupture “an act of God,” though gassing victims point out that many who believe that were not in town the night of the disaster.Interestingly, only a few of the residents interviewed for this article had heard of carbon capture and sequestration ― and none knew about plans for a greatly expanded CO2 pipeline network.“That doesn’t make any sense,” said Martin. “Not when they can’t control what they’ve already got. I think there’s real basic questions that need to be answered first.”Linda Garrett said she still struggles with back pain from carrying Makaylan to the car that day. Makaylan’s asthma, which had been in remission, is worse than ever, and both her daughter and granddaughter remain traumatized. She wants the company punished.Denbury, she said, should have warned the town before there was an emergency.“If you cared about us, you and the pipeline, you should have let us know,” Garrett said. “But you didn’t let us know nothing. You just telling us now. That doesn’t seem right to me. Sometimes we have to be held accountable for the things that happen.”CORRECTIONS: An earlier version of this article misidentified a person affected as Lynett Burns. The woman’s name is Lynett Garrett.

If anything, they see progress in the ever-growing share of Americans who recognize climate change as a serious issue: A majority of the country, or 6 in 10 people as of a 2020 Pew Research survey, say global climate change is a “major threat” to the country, up from 44% in 2009. We need more coverage of the climate crisis, scientists said, not less.Still, the experts recognized that for those paying close attention to the crisis, particularly people living in communities directly affected by fires, storms and floods, it can be exhausting.“I get the fatigue and the climate grief,” said Astrid Caldas, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “What kind of world are we leaving for the next generation?”For climate scientists themselves, who have been sounding the alarm on this for decades, much of their own “fatigue” comes from what they see as a lack of sufficient action from political and corporate leaders, who have the power to implement the large-scale solutions needed to avert the worst.“I am ‘report fatigued.’ We need action,” Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric sciences program, wrote at Forbes this month. He called for more planning from local and federal governments for a transition to “a renewable energy economy,” and urged leaders to “address the disproportionate burden” of climate disasters on “vulnerable, poor, and marginalized populations.”The experts HuffPost spoke to all had the same antidote to climate dread: Take action. The climate crisis is urgent, the changes needed are at a massive scale, but it doesn’t mean individuals can’t make a difference.“We are now in an all-hands-on-deck moment,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of Yale University’s program on climate change communication. “We need everybody doing everything they can, at the individual level, community level, national government and business level. This is all of society.”For scientists tasked with communicating to the public the urgency of the climate crisis and what needs to be done, part of the challenge is the wide range of people’s understanding of just how bad the situation is.Americans are deeply politically divided on climate change. About 72% of Democrats say human activity is contributing “a great deal” to climate change, versus just 22% of Republicans, according to Pew. A vast majority of Democrats say climate change is impacting their local community (83%), while less than half of Republicans do (37%). And while 89% of Democrats think the government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, only 35% of Republicans think so.There is another way to slice up the country when it comes to environmental issues, per Leiserowitz’s team at Yale: the “six Americas.” Through dozens of national surveys in the U.S. over years, the researchers identified six separate audiences who approach the climate crisis from different vantage points. These groups include the “alarmed” (around 26% of the U.S. in 2020 — encouragingly, up from 11% in 2014), who know that the crisis is happening, it’s human-caused and it’s urgent; the “concerned” (28% of the population), who know the crisis is human-caused, but think of its effects as more distant in time and place; the “doubtful” (12%), who aren’t sure if climate change is real, but think that if it is, it likely has little to do with human action; and the “dismissive” (at an all-time low of 7%), many of whom believe climate change isn’t happening at all.When it comes to spurring action, Leiserowitz emphasized the need to “meet people where they are” in crafting messages that can get through to people all along the spectrum of climate understanding.One of the most significant factors in determining people’s level of concern about climate change, experts said, is whether they live in front-line communities experiencing the devastating effects of the crisis year after year, such as high heat, deadly fires or devastating storms and floods.And those communities most vulnerable to climate change — including those experiencing slower recoveries in the aftermath of climate disasters — are disproportionately poor, Black and Latinx.“When you see your family members die, your house washing out from under your feet, when your fishing grounds are not productive, plants are dying around you — and the root of that is climate change — it is personal,” said Isabel Rivera-Collazo, an assistant professor on human adaptation to climate change at the University of California, San Diego, who works with coastal communities in northern Puerto Rico.There is “serious mental health fatigue” for people in communities directly affected by climate change, Rivera-Collazo said. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, which killed thousands of Puerto Ricans and left hundreds of thousands without power for months, there was an increase in suicides.For the scientists studying climate change, too, there is exhaustion in repeating the same message for years and not seeing an adequate response from corporations or government.“All of us in the expert community know we should have acted 40 years ago, and the window is closing ... At some point, you cross important thresholds and everything we’re experiencing now gets much, much worse,” Leiserowitz said. “So in the climate expertise community, of course we’re frustrated. We’ve been saying, ‘World, you need to take this seriously.’ ... We’re all frustrated with the fact that the message hasn’t gotten through enough to drive the kind of action that is required.”Rivera-Collazo pointed to the “burnout” she and other researchers feel from working with front-line communities and seeing the increased damage to those communities over time.“I personally receive hundreds of phone calls asking me to do something, and I feel powerless. Apart from doing my research, how much more can I do?” Rivera-Collazo said, noting she goes to therapy to help with the mental health effects of her work. “I don’t have an answer to how to mitigate coastal erosion and the loss of biodiversity. There are small things we can do, but governments and corporations have much more power than single researchers and individual communities.”Rivera-Collazo said she’s “particularly worried” for young people who may feel “despair” or feel “powerless” thinking that climate action is “not realistic,” given the relatively small impact of the individual decisions they can make — buying local goods, eating less meat, turning lights off, recycling — versus big corporations’ large-scale damage to the environment.But Leiserowitz warned against such nihilism, saying individual action and systemic change go hand in hand. “You need both,” he said. “It’s not either/or, it’s both/and.”“I can’t build a private bullet train from New York to L.A., so yes, we do need systems change to ultimately solve this,” Leiserowitz said. “But how do you get to systems change? We live in democracies. You get big systems change if the public is demanding action. It’s public and political will.”He added that the world has “everything we need” right now to combat the climate crisis in terms of technology, policy ideas and money.“We’re just missing the demand for those solutions,” Leiserowitz said. “Public and political will: That’s the missing ingredient.”Even so, knowing what to do as an individual in the face of a massive climate crisis is not so straightforward. Even among the most “alarmed” on Yale’s scale of “six Americas,” many still don’t know what they, or society, can do to address climate change effectively.Climate experts shared some ideas for simple steps you can take now to get more engaged:Conservation psychologist Susan Clayton suggested finding a group to join — or creating one of your own — whether its purpose is discussion, activism or community.“Everyone thinks, what can an individual do? But think of a vote. Does a single vote make a difference in an election? Almost never. But I am committed to vote,” Clayton said. “My single action may not make a difference on climate change, but it’s a way of participating in a collective battle to deal with this crisis.”Leiserowitz noted that people’s individual decisions in their homes, when multiplied by millions of households, can make the difference in transitioning from an economy dependent on harmful fossil fuels to one that relies on much more eco-friendly renewable energy.He suggested choosing electric cars over gas-run vehicles, replacing gas-burning stoves and furnaces with heat pumps, buying clean energy from your power company and putting solar panels on your roof.“To achieve the big change we need, you need to engage the decisions of billions of people,” he said.In the communities in Puerto Rico that Rivera-Collazo works with, residents who’ve seen coastal erosion and the effects of storms on their beaches have been leading activities to stimulate biodiversity and reduce pollution, including reforesting an area damaged by Hurricane Maria and doing beach cleanups.“Each time, we collect less and less trash, because of engagement with users of the beach,” she said. “One community member said for her it’s the most important. She feels she’s doing something.”Rivera-Collazo noted that climate change is “larger than a single community on a three-mile stretch of coast,” but “once people feel ownership, they can push back on larger causes: governments, industry.”Robert Bullard, a longtime environmental justice researcher and professor of environmental policy at Texas Southern University in Houston, noted that “Black and brown, lower-income communities” are often the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and have the fewest resources to recover after disasters.In Houston, the same communities that were still recovering from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 were hit again by devastating floods in subsequent years and a major winter storm this February. That unusual storm caused widespread power outages, leaving some people freezing in prisons without running water and other people with spikes in their energy bills. “It’s one after the other,” Bullard said.Rivera-Collazo also noted that “many of these communities carrying the burden of climate change are suffering other things,” including poverty and gentrification.“When we say ‘what can we do’ to invite people to do more, remember some people cannot do more,” she said. “Others have to do more.”Rivera-Collazo walks her students through an exercise to engage them on climate change, urging them to think of the basic things they consider necessary for “living well” in their daily lives.“Start thinking about how those privileges you are currently enjoying, when they get impacted — not if, when — what are you going to do?” she said. She asks students to consider where their food, water and electricity come from.“If you feel safe, if you feel distant, it means you’re not aware of your vulnerabilities,” she said. “Climate change is so big, everyone is being threatened.”All of the scientists HuffPost spoke to said that the key to stopping dread and starting to take action on climate change is knowing there is hope. The worst can still be averted.Leiserowitz noted that the U.S. is already “well into the transition” from fossil fuels to clean energy.“Good news ― wind and solar are cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world today,” he said. “This is where the future is going. The question is, will we make that transition fast enough?”For Rivera-Collazo, hope comes from seeing front-line communities “not just sitting back and crying,” but taking it into their own hands to clean and replenish local coastlines. “They are doing things. That for me is a source of hope,” she said. “People are not sitting back and waiting for somebody to come save them.”Bullard, who is 74, locates his hope in young people “beginning to flex their political muscle, voting and getting into policy positions,” and particularly youth who are “demanding transformative change rather than incremental baby steps.”And Caldas, from the Union of Concerned Scientists, had a message for the not-so-young: “The youth fighting so hard ... At one moment or another, their parents’ generation is going to wake up to the fact that their kids are fighting for a mess they are making, and they should get engaged.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

In Tennessee, at least 22 people were killed and more than 200 homes destroyed after a giant storm unleashed up to 17 inches of rain, causing rivers to quickly swell. In the Northeast, slow-moving Tropical Storm Henri drenched New York City and other major metropolitan areas, causing as much as $4 billion in losses. Central Park saw nearly 2 inches of precipitation in a single hour, likely the most of any one-hour period on record.The string of U.S. floods comes about a month after catastrophic flooding in Germany and Belgium, which left a trail of destruction and killed nearly 200 people.Megadroughts and megafloods might seem like opposites, but they are in fact two sides of the same deadly coin. As human greenhouse gas emissions drive up global temperatures, the world can expect both extreme events to become more frequent and severe, warned a recent landmark report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.“There’s increasing evidence for an overintensification of the water cycle,” said Alex Ruane, a NASA scientist and a lead author of the IPCC report’s chapter on regional impacts. “Water is moving through the climate system faster than it used to. That means it is being evaporated into the air faster, it’s being moved around, and it’s raining down harder when it does rain. All of these things are actually connected to the same factor, which is that warmer air has a tendency to hold more moisture.”The current conditions across the country — drought in the West and torrential precipitation in the East — highlight a trend that scientists have been documenting in recent decades and offer a glimpse of what to expect in the coming years.“These are examples of the type of conditions that we think are going to be more and more widespread and pronounced with each increment of climate change,” Ruane said.The crisis is already affecting weather in “every region across the globe,” from grueling heat waves and drought to more intense tropical cyclones and precipitation events, the IPCC said. Since the 1950s, heavy precipitation events have increased across most land areas, with human climate change “likely the main driver,” the report states.It’s difficult to pinpoint the extent to which anthropogenic warming is responsible for a given extreme weather event, be it a flood, hurricane or heat wave. But advances in attribution science have allowed experts to state unequivocally that such events would have been less likely if not for planetary warming.The severe flooding in Germany, for example, was between 1.2 and 9 times more likely due to climate change, according to a rapid attribution study. The deadly heat wave in the Pacific Northwest last month would have been “virtually impossible” without it, concluded another.The frequency of so-called “100-year” and “500-year” flood events has left some scientists questioning whether it’s time to scrap the terminology altogether. The term “100-year flood” doesn’t mean the event can be expected once every century, but rather is of a magnitude that “statistically has a 1-percent chance of occurring in any given year,” as the U.S. Geological Survey explains on its website. In other words, the probability of a 100-year flood occurring in a given location this year is 1 in 100.Houston, Texas, experienced back-to-back-to-back “500-year” events in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The recent flooding in Tennessee surpassed even the “1,000-year” benchmark, according to the National Weather Service.“We’re seeing more and more of these extreme events globally,” Tom Terry, a meteorologist in Orlando, Florida, wrote on Twitter. “This is a tell-tale sign of global climate change.”"}, {"title": "Crews Struggle To Stop Fire Bearing Down On Lake Tahoe", "text": "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) — A California fire that gutted hundreds of homes advanced toward Lake Tahoe on Wednesday as thousands of firefighters tried to box in the flames and tourists who hoped to boat or swim were enveloped in a thick yellow haze of the nation’s worst air.The Caldor Fire spread to within 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of the lake that straddles the California-Nevada state line, eating its way through rugged timberlands and “knocking on the door” of the Lake Tahoe basin, California’s state fire chief Thom Porter warned this week.Ash rained down on Tuesday and tourists ducked into cafes, outdoor gear shops and casinos on Lake Tahoe Boulevard for a respite from the unhealthy air.South Lake Tahoe and Tahoe City on the west shore had the nation’s worst air pollution at midmorning Wednesday, reaching 334, in the “hazardous” category of the 0-500 Air Quality Index, according to AirNow, a partnership of federal, state and local air agencies.Inside the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, cocktail waitresses in fishnet stockings and leopard-print corsets served customers playing slots and blackjack.Sitting at a slot machine near a window looking out at cars driving through the haze, Ramona Trejo said she and her husband would stay for their 50th wedding anniversary, as planned.Trejo, who uses supplemental oxygen due to respiratory problems, said her husband wanted to keep gambling.“I would want to go now,” she said.South of Tahoe, Rick Nelson and his wife, Diane, had planned to host a weekend wedding at Fallen Leaf Lake, where his daughter and her fiance had met. However, the smoke caused most of the community to leave. The sun was an eerie blood orange and the floats and boats in the lake were obscured by haze.In the end, the Nelsons spent two days arranging to have the wedding moved from the glacial lake several hours southwest to the San Francisco Bay Area.“Everybody’s trying to make accommodations for the smoke. And I think it’s becoming a reality for us, unfortunately,” Diane Nelson said. “I just think that the smoke and the fires have gotten bigger, hotter and faster-moving.”Climate change has made the West warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.Although there were no evacuations ordered for Lake Tahoe, it was impossible to ignore a blanket of haze so thick and vast that it closed schools for a second day in Reno, Nevada, which is about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the fire.The school district that includes Reno reopened most schools on Wednesday, citing improved air quality conditions. However, the Washoe County School District’s schools in Incline Village on the north shore of Lake Tahoe remained closed, the district said in a statement.The last major blaze in the area, during the summer of 2007, took South Lake Tahoe by surprise after blowing up from an illegal campfire. The Angora Fire burned less than 5 square miles (13 square kilometers) but destroyed 254 homes, injured three people and forced 2,000 people to flee.The Caldor fire has scorched more than 197 square miles (510 square kilometers) and destroyed at least 461 homes since Aug. 14 in the Sierra Nevada southwest of the lake. It was 11% contained and threatened more than 17,000 structures.The western side of the blaze continued to threaten more than a dozen small communities and wineries. On the fire’s eastern side, crews bulldozed fire lines, opened up narrow logging roads and cleared ridgetops in hopes of stopping its advance, fire officials said.More than 2,500 firefighters were on the line and more resources were streaming in, including big firefighting aircraft, fire officials said.“It’s the No. 1 fire in the country right now ... there’s dozens of crews and dozers and engines and others that are on their way right now,” said Jeff Marsolais, supervisor for the Eldorado National Forest and an administrator on the fire.The resources were desperately needed.“This fire has just simply outpaced us. We emptied the cupboards of resources,” Marsolais said, adding that while the blaze had slowed its explosive growth in recent days, “that can change.”Meanwhile, California’s Dixie Fire, the second-largest in state history at 1,148 square miles (2,973 square kilometers), was burning only about 65 miles (104 kilometers) to the north. It was 43% contained. At least 682 homes were among more than 1,270 buildings that have been destroyed.Nationally, 92 large fires were burning in a dozen mainly Western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.Northern California has experienced a series of disastrous blazes that have burned hundreds of homes and many remain uncontained.On Tuesday, President Joe Biden declared that a major disaster exists in California and ordered federal aid made available to local governments, agencies and fire victims in four northern counties ravaged by blazes dating back to July 14.___Melley and AP reporter John Antczak reported from Los Angeles.Sam Metz is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) — More than 13,500 firefighters were working Monday to contain a dozen large California wildfires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to flee to safety.After an extensive review of fire damage, Gov. Gavin Newsom requested a presidential major disaster declaration for eight counties, Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Office of Emergency Services, told a briefing near Sacramento.If approved, the declaration would provide a wide range of assistance including housing, food aid, unemployment and governmental emergency costs, Ghilarducci said.Nearly 43,000 Californians were under evacuation orders and more than 500 households were in shelters, he said.New concerns were developing at the explosive Caldor Fire southwest of Lake Tahoe, the famed alpine lake straddling the California-Nevada state line and surrounded by peaks of the Sierra Nevada and resort communities.The Caldor Fire, just 9% contained, has become the nation’s number one priority for firefighting resources, said Chief Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.“It is knocking on the door to the Lake Tahoe basin,” Porter said. “We have all efforts in place to keep it out of the basin but we do need to also be aware that is a possibility based on the way the fires have been burning.”Porter said he personally did not believe the fire would get into the basin but that he could be proved wrong.The Caldor Fire has incinerated nearly 180 square miles (466 square kilometers) of El Dorado National Forest and continuing assessments showed 447 buildings destroyed. More than 17,000 structures were still under threat.Two police officers from the Sacramento County city of Galt were in critical condition after a head-on traffic collision while they were headed to the Caldor Fire under a law enforcement mutual aid deployment, Ghilarducci said.To the north, containment increased to 40% at the Dixie Fire, which has burned more than 1,130 square miles (2,926 square kilometers) in the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades. Ongoing assessments showed 1,259 buildings destroyed, including 678 single-family homes, Cal Fire said. Nearly 13,000 structures remained threatened.In Nevada, public schools in the Reno and Sparks area and parts of Lake Tahoe were closed Monday due to wildfire smoke, affecting 67,000 students.In Northern California, where most of the blazes are burning, there were no red flag warnings for critical conditions but the seven-day outlook called for moderate fire danger. In Southern California, meanwhile, moist ocean air has been keeping skies cloudy and temperatures cooler than normal well into each day.Porter said that meant there was low potential for large new fires in Southern California, allowing firefighting resources to be surged from south to north.While Southern California has so far escaped large-scale wildfires this year, Los Angeles officials on Monday urged residents to be aware of what’s going on in the north because the region’s high fire season is typically late in the year when dry, gusty Santa Ana winds blast out of the interior and flow toward the coast.“That awareness is going to help us when it happens here in Southern California,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said during a briefing to display the city’s fleet of firefighting helicopters at Van Nuys Airport.The mix of spring growth dried out by summer heat and high winds creates “a dangerous condition that could lead to large, fast-moving brush fires,” he said.California’s fires were among more than 90 large, active blazes in the U.S. on Monday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.In Oregon, officials said a firefighter died Monday while battling a wildfire southeast of Eugene.Bryan Cutchen, Oakridge city administrator and acting fire chief, said the death is suspected to have been caused by a tree falling on the firefighter, The Register-Guard reported.Climate change has made the West warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists."}, {"title": "Rescue Workers Continue Arduous Search For Victims Of Deadly Tennessee Floods", "text": "WAVERLY, Tenn. (AP) — Anna Mays woke up in a panic attack Monday, thinking she was back in the rising floodwater.Two days ago, she had been clinging for her life to the front door of her duplex in rural Tennessee as the water inched up to her neck. Her brother was hanging onto a tree.Then Mays realized where she was: The gym at the Waverly Church of Christ, now her temporary home alongside other victims of record-breaking rain Saturday that sent floodwaters surging through the region, killing at least 22 people.Her story has become a familiar one in Humphreys County, and particularly the small town of Waverly. Large swaths of the community are suddenly displaced, sorting through difficult decisions about what comes next even as they relive the horror of what just happened.“This morning I was having a panic attack and thought I was in water, and I was trying to get that way and trying to get this way. I was just scared half to death,” said Mays, who doesn’t know how to swim. “I was just, something woke me up and I thought I was in the water, and — I never have seen — I’ve seen it on TV, but I’ve never have seen it like it in life, where cars was going by.”Mays started gathering up a few belongings after a police officer came to the door of her duplex Saturday morning, telling her to evacuate. She and her brother could see the water rising quickly. Her brother was trying to keep it out of the house by shoving towels under the door, but they were soon overwhelmed. Minutes later, the flooded creek pushed open the door and water poured into the house.Mays’ brother went outside to try to find a way onto the roof but ended up clinging to a tree. Mays held on to the front door until they were rescued by boat, escaping with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. Mays said the neighbor on the other side of the duplex lost her daughter, who was about 7 or 8 years old.While survivors grappled with their recollections — more than 90 people stayed in shelters Sunday, according to the state’s American Red Cross chapter — rescue workers continued their arduous searches for anyone else swept away.Authorities rummaged through heaps of debris as search and rescue teams used dogs to try to sniff out any missing people, Waverly police Chief Grant Gillespie said.“There’s still a lot of debris in and along the creek that needs to be examined. That’s a painstaking process,” Gillespie said during a news conference. “We have to tear that apart, a lot of times, with equipment.”The police chief said the number of people considered missing has fluctuated, as people have not been able to reach loved ones who are later confirmed to be safe.“I’m reasonably sure that we are less than 10 right now that we are truly not sure about the whereabouts of, or that we don’t think we’ll resolve fairly easily,” Gillespie said.Saturday’s flooding took out roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines, leaving people uncertain about whether family and friends survived the unprecedented deluge, with rainfall that more than tripled forecasts and shattered the state record for one-day rainfall. Emergency workers were searching door to door, said Kristi Brown, coordinated health and safety supervisor with Humphreys County Schools.Many of the missing live in the neighborhoods where the water rose the fastest, said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis, who confirmed the 22 fatalities in his county. The names of the missing were on a board in the county’s emergency center and listed on a city of Waverly Facebook page, which is being updated as people call in and report themselves safe.The Humphreys County Sheriff Office Facebook page  filled with people looking for  missing friends and family. GoFundMe pages asked for help for funeral expenses for the dead, including 7-month-old twins swept from their father’s arms as they tried to escape.The death of the twins was confirmed by surviving family members. A foreman at country music star Loretta Lynn’s ranch also died. The sheriff of the county of about 18,000 people some 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Nashville said he lost one of his best friends.Up to 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain fell in Humphreys County in less than 24 hours Saturday, passing the Tennessee record for one-day rainfall by more than 3 inches (8 centimeters), the National Weather Service said, though Saturday’s numbers will have to be confirmed.School was canceled for the week, according to the sheriff’s office. Waverly Elementary and Waverly Junior High suffered extensive damage, according to Brown. About 2,000 homes in the county were without power Monday evening, utility officials said.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee toured the area, calling it a “devastating picture of loss and heartache.” President Joe Biden offered condolences to the people of Tennessee and directed federal disaster officials to talk with the governor and offer assistance.Survivors played back the harrowing moments when the water closed in.Billy Ray Rushing was staying with his daughter, Annie Rushing, when they were told to evacuate.“Right then and there, we got in the car and left,” he said.The water was already over their muffler. Their neighbor, Mary, on the other side of the duplex went back inside her home but soon was calling, asking them to come back for her, Rushing said. It was too late.“There wasn’t any way we could get back there. I hate it, but I couldn’t take the chance of her and me drowning,” he said, indicating his daughter.That same neighbor warned Jodie Stawski, across the street, to get out before the water reached their apartment.“But as we went, as we was driving out, we could see these people on their porches,” said Stawski on Monday. “And I think in my mind, they thought they were safe. That the water was not going to get that high. But from what I heard, it gushed at them. And we lost Miss Mary. She drowned in the process. She was our hero. She saved us.”___Kristin M.

Bill Lee toured the area, stopping on Main Street in Waverly where some homes were washed off their foundations and people were sifting though their water-logged possessions.Shirley Foster cried as the governor walked up. She said she just learned a friend from her church was dead.“I thought I was over the shock of all this. I’m just tore up over my friend. My house is nothing, but my friend is gone,” Foster told the governor.The hardest-hit areas saw double the rain that area of Middle Tennessee had in the previous worst-case scenario for flooding, meteorologists said. Lines of storms moved over the area for hours, wringing out a record amount of moisture — a scenario scientists have warned may be more common because of global warming.The downpours rapidly turned the creeks that run behind backyards and through downtown Waverly into raging rapids. Business owner Kansas Klein stood on a bridge Saturday in the town of 4,500 people and saw two girls who were holding on to a puppy and clinging to a wooden board sweep past, the current too fast for anyone to grab them.He isn’t sure what happened to them. Klein heard that a girl and a puppy had been rescued downstream, and that another girl was also saved, but he wasn’t sure it was them.By Sunday, the floodwaters were gone, leaving behind debris from wrecked cars, demolished businesses and homes and a chaotic, tangled mix of the things inside.“It was amazing how quick it came and how quick it left,” Klein said.The Humphreys County Sheriff Office Facebook page filled with people looking for  missing friends and family. GoFundMe pages were made asking for help for funeral expenses for the dead, including 7-month-old twins yanked from their father’s arms as they tried to escape.Not far from the bridge, Klein told The Associated Press by phone that dozens of buildings in a low-income housing area known as Brookside appeared to have borne the brunt of the flash flood from Trent Creek.“It was devastating: buildings were knocked down, half of them were destroyed,” Klein said. “People were pulling out bodies of people who had drowned and didn’t make it out.”At the Cash Saver grocery in in Waverly, employees stood on desks, registers and a flower rack as the waters from the creek that’s usually 400 feet (120 meters) from the store rushed in after devastating the low income housing next door. At one point, they tried to break through the celling into the attic and couldn’t, store co-owner David Hensley said.The flood waters stopped rising as fast just as the situation was getting dire and a rescue boat came by. “We told him that if there’s somebody else out there you can get, go get them, we think we’re OK,” Hensley said.Just to the east of Waverly, the town of McEwen was pummeled Saturday with 17.02 inches (43.2 centimeters) of rain, smashing the state’s 24-hour record of 13.6 inches (34.5 centimeters) from 1982, according to the National Weather Service in Nashville, though Saturday’s numbers would have to be confirmed.A flash flood watch was issued for the area before the rain started, with forecasters saying 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain was possible. The worst storm recorded in this area of Middle Tennessee only dropped 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, said Krissy Hurley, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville.“Forecasting almost a record is something we don’t do very often,” Hurley said. “Double the amount we’ve ever seen was almost unfathomable.”Recent scientific research has determined that extreme rain events will become more frequent because of man-made climate change. Hurley said it is impossible to know its exact role in Saturday’s flood, but noted in the past year her office dealt with floods that used to be expected maybe once every 100 years in September south of Nashville and in March closer to the city.“We had an incredible amount of water in the atmosphere,” Hurley said of Saturday’s flooding. “Thunderstorms developed and moved across the same area over and over and over.”The problem isn’t limited to Tennessee. A federal study found man-made climate change doubles the chances of the types of heavy downpours that in August 2016 dumped 26 inches (66 centimeters) of rain around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Those floods killed at least 13 people and damaged 150,000 homes.___Collins contributed to this report from Columbia, South Carolina.

The “attacks” mainly involved males during breeding season, and occurred in the midst of activities like sea snake courting rituals or two rival males fighting.“In fact, it’s just a lovesick boy looking for a girlfriend and making a rather foolish mistake,” herpetologist and study co-author Rick Shine of Macquarie University in Australia told The New York Times.The snakes have somewhat poor vision and are seemingly launching themselves at divers in an attempt to find out whether they’re suitable mates, study co-author, Ross Alford, professor emeritus Australia’s James Cook University, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.“They just go, ’Hey, there’s a big thing over there. I’ll just go check if it’s a female snake,’” he said, adding that once the snake realizes his error, he’ll typically leave.That’s why Alford recommended that if you find yourself in this unpleasant situation, simply stay calm and allow the snake to “investigate” you “with its tongue.” Shine also noted that sea snakes move so fast, you probably won’t be able to get away anyway, and trying to fight is just likely to make the snake more aggressive."}, {"title": "Coastal Evacuations Urged As Hurricane Henri Heads North", "text": "Preparations for a storm grew more urgent Saturday as the newly upgraded Hurricane Henri closed in on the Northeast.The storm’s latest track put it course to collide Sunday with a long stretch of coastline, with hurricane warnings extending from near the old whaling port of New Bedford, Massachusetts, across the luxurious oceanfront estates of New York’s Hamptons, to the summer getaway of Fire Island.Intense winds and potentially dangerous tidal surges were expected as far east as Cape Cod and as far west as the New Jersey shore, and utilities warned ensuing power outages could last a week or even more.Henri was veering a bit further west than originally expected, and if that track holds, it would have eastern Long Island in its bull’s-eye rather than New England, which hasn’t taken a direct hit from a hurricane since the deadly Hurricane Bob in 1991.New York hasn’t had a direct hit from a powerful cyclone since Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc in 2012. Some of the most important repairs from that storm have been completed, but many projects designed to protect against future storms remain unfinished.Residents and visitors on Fire Island, a narrow strip of sandy villages barely above sea level off Long Island’s southern coast, were urged to evacuate. The last boats out will leave at 10:40 p.m. Saturday; after that, officials said, there may be no way out for people who decide to ride out the storm.“If they do not leave the island today, they will be stuck on the island and we do not know what kind of conditions they may be facing. But they could be difficult. They could be dangerous,” said Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone.Gov. Andrew Cuomo pleaded with New York residents to make last-minute preparations, warning that heavy rain, winds and storm surges from Henri could be as devastating as Superstorm Sandy in some parts of the state.“We have short notice. We’re talking about tomorrow,” Cuomo said. “So if you have to move, if you have to stock up, if you have to get to higher ground, it has to be today. Please.”Service on some eastern branches of the Long Island Rail Road, a major commuter rail system, will be suspended at midnight, said CuomoThe governor, who will leave office in two days following a sexual harassment scandal, warned that heavy rains were expected to create problems far up into the Hudson River Valley.With a top wind speed of 75 mph (120 kph) Saturday, Henri sped up to move north-northeast at 17 mph (27 kph) as of Saturday afternoon. It’s still about 395 miles (635 kilometers) south of Montauk Point on New York’s Long Island.Southampton Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman said the town was considering issuing a voluntary evacuation advisory for about 6,000 people. He said current storm models show that the storm’s center would run “smack on the town of Southampton.” He described a run on supplies like batteries and flashlights as people “are starting to wake up.”“Right now it seems like a sunny summer day, but, you know, by this time tomorrow we’re going to be in the middle of potentially a severe hurricane,” he said.Regardless of its exact landfall, broad impacts were expected across a large swath of the Northeast, extending inland to Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, and eastward to Cape Cod, which is teeming with tens of thousands of summer tourists.Storm surge between 3 and 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) is possible from Flushing, New York, to Chatham, Massachusetts, and for parts of the North Shore and South Shore of Long Island, the hurricane center said.Rainfall between 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 centimeters) is expected Sunday through Monday.The weather service warned of the potential for damaging winds and widespread coastal flooding, and officials in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York cautioned that people could lose power for days. Authorities advised people to secure their boats, fuel up their vehicles and stock up on canned goods.Gov. Ned Lamont warned Connecticut residents they should prepare to “shelter in place” from Sunday afternoon through at least Monday morning as the state braces for the first possible direct hit from a hurricane in decades.In the Hamptons, the celebrity playground on Long Island’s east end, officials warned of dangerous rip currents and flooding that’s likely to turn streets like the mansion-lined Dune Road into lagoons.“We have a lot of wealthy people. There’s no doubt that we do, but everybody pulls together in an emergency,” Schneiderman said. “So, you know, yeah, there are people hanging out on their yachts at the moment drinking martinis, but they’re also starting to talk about this storm and I’m sure they’re going to want to be helpful.”___Hill reported from Albany, New York.

(AP) — Parts of the Northeast could begin to feel the effects of Hurricane Henri as soon as late Saturday, as the storm barrels toward the region.Forecasters said Henri was expected to remain at or near hurricane strength when it makes landfall midafternoon Sunday, which the hurricane center said could be on New York’s Long Island or in southern New England — most likely Connecticut. The upgrade in status came with the National Hurricane Center’s 11 a.m. advisory.Storm surge and the tide could cause high water in coastal New England as Henri moves inland, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. Heavy rain and wind may also produce flooding.Henri was veering a bit further west than originally expected, and if that track holds, it would have eastern Long Island in its bullseye rather than New England, which hasn’t taken a direct hit from a hurricane since Hurricane Bob in 1991, a Category 2 storm that killed at least 17 people.New York hasn’t had a direct hit from a major hurricane season storm since Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc in 2012.Regardless of its exact landfall, broad impacts were expected across a large swath of the Northeast, extending inland to Hartford, Connecticut, and Albany, New York, and eastward to Cape Cod, which is teeming with tens of thousands of summer tourists.Massachusetts Gov.

(AP) — President Joe Biden’s administration is sticking by the decision under former President Donald Trump to lift protections for gray wolves across most of the U.S. But a top federal wildlife official on Friday told The Associated Press there is growing concern over aggressive wolf hunting seasons adopted for the predators in the western Great Lakes and northern Rocky Mountains.Wolves under federal protection made a remarkable rebound in parts of the U.S. over the past several decades, after being driven from the landscape by excessive hunting and trapping in the early 1900s.States took over wolf management last decade in the Northern Rockies and in January for the remainder of the Lower 48 states, including the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest.The removal of Endangered Species Act protections had been in the works for years and was the right thing to do when finalized in Trump’s last days, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Assistant Director for Ecological Services Gary Frazer told AP.On Friday, attorneys for the administration asked a federal judge in California to reject a lawsuit from wildlife advocate s that seeks to restore protections, signaling the conclusion of Biden’s promise on his first day in office to review the Trump move.But wolf management policies in place at the state level have shifted dramatically since protections were lifted, and Frazer suggested the federal government could take steps to restore protections if population declines put wolves back on the path to extinction.“Certainly some of the things we’re seeing are concerning,” he said.Wisconsin moved quickly to reduce the state’s wolf numbers, after a pro-hunting group with close ties to conservative Republicans won a court order that allowed hunters — some using hounds — to kill 218 wolves in four days.Meanwhile, Republican-dominated legislatures in Idaho and Montana loosened hunting rules to allow tactics shunned by many wildlife managers, including hunting wolves at night and from the air and payments for dead wolves reminiscent of bounties that drove them to near-extinction.Frazer said the different states showed a common approach: legislatures and politically appointed wildlife commissions taking determined steps to reduce populations.“We’re aware that circumstances have changed and we’ll be watching closely to see how the population responds,” he added.The lead attorney in the lawsuit to restore protections for wolves outside of the Northern Rockies said he was disappointed in the Biden administration for not responding immediately to the push by states to cull more packs.“Why should we hammer the population back down and lose all the gains that have been made before any kind of remedial action?” asked Tim Preso with the environmental law firm Earthjustice. “The writing’s on the wall. Montana and Idaho are clear on what they’re intending and Wisconsin is right behind them.”Montana wildlife commissioners on Friday adopted hunting rule changes in accordance with new state laws that allow the use of snares to kill wolves, night hunting and use of bait — methods criticized as unethical by some hunters and former officials. The new rules went further than recommended by state wildlife experts, who for example wanted to limit snare use to private land only.Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission Vice Chair Patrick Tabor, a hunting outfitter from the Whitefish area, said in voting in favor of the changes that he was proud of his hunting ethics. Tabor said the loosened rules “allow more opportunity for hunters, to give them in essence better odds in trying to be successful because they (wolves) are an incredibly difficult animal to hunt.”Defenders of the move to lift federal protections noted efforts to put wolves under state management enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington going back to President Barack Obama.Yet the policies adopted by the states reflect an increasingly partisan approach to predator management in legislatures dominated by Republicans.The wolf population in the Midwest has grown to more than 4,400 wolves, according to government figures disputed by some scientists who say officials undercount wolves killed by poachers.There’s been growing frustration in recent years among livestock producers and hunters over attacks on cattle and big game. In Wisconsin, a Republican-controlled board set the state’s fall hunt quota at 300 animals, rejecting a 130-animal limit recommended by state wildlife managers.Wisconsin’s Democratic attorney general is seeking a court order to oust the board’s chairman, whose term expired in May. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has appointed a successor, but the incumbent is refusing to step down until the Senate confirms the appointment. The Senate, dominated by Republicans, hasn’t held a hearing on the appointment.Hundreds of wolves are now killed annually by hunters and trappers in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. The Northern Rockies’ population has remained strong — more than 3,000 animals, according to wildlife officials — because wolves breed so successfully and can roam huge areas of wild land in the sparsely populated region.Some state officials are intent on reducing those numbers to curb livestock attacks and protect the big game herds that wolves prey upon. Supporters of restoring protections warn that will tip the scales and reduce wolf numbers to unsustainable levels, while also threatening packs in nearby states that have interconnected populations.An indication of how deeply federal officials are worried about the states’ wolf policies is expected in the next several weeks, when they respond to petitions filed in June to again put wolves in the U.S. West under federal protections.Iris Samuels contributed from Helena, Montana.

Rare tropical weather is making its way up off the Atlantic coast of the U.S., destined for New York and New England — two regions that don’t often play host to tropical storms.Right now, it’s looking like New York’s Long Island and southern New England — particularly Connecticut. If it makes landfall in New York, that would be the first time the state’s sustained a direct hit during a hurricane season since 2012′s Superstorm Sandy — the effects of which are still plaguing New York.A stormy trio. Henri is the tropical storm that’s expected to strengthen into a hurricane — and perhaps become New England’s first in 30 years. Bob was its predecessor, responsible for the deaths of 17 and $1.5 billion in damages in August 1991. But with Connecticut in Henri’s sights, some might better remember Gloria — the September 1985 hurricane made landfall on both Long Island and Connecticut and caused eight deaths and nearly $1 billion in damages.These storms have human names courtesy the World Meteorological Association, which draws up a list of 21 names for each Atlantic hurricane season.There are two ingredients needed for a storm to track this far up north: a tropical system itself and steering currents. Most tropical systems in the northern hemisphere run out or recur before they can make their way north, according to the National Weather Service.No, perhaps surprisingly. It’s just a tropical weather phenomenon, the National Weather Service says. We shouldn’t necessarily expect to see more frequent New England tropical stormsThis isn’t New England or New York’s first rodeo with weather writ large. After all, a nor’easter is just a hurricane with a Boston accent. It’s not too different in the Long Island dialect either. So, the usual protocols apply: Get boats out of the water, gas up cars, stock the pantry and batten down the hatches. Be prepared for power outages, too.Oh, yes. School is back in session in parts of the east coast, but there are still thousands of tourists enjoying the beaches of Cape Cod, the Hamptons and elsewhere.Henri isn’t winning any races. Its slow churn could be a good thing, increasing the chance it will falter quickly. But it could also mean a lot of concentrated rain.Nope, though both storms were in 1991. The so-called “perfect storm” — also known as the Halloween Storm — hit New England about two months later. It started as a nor’easter, in which form it inflicted the most damage. A hurricane eventually formed at its center — but it purposely went unnamed, because meteorologists worried it would be distracting.Henri.Yep! Atlantic hurricane names are recycled every six years, unless they’re retired out of notoriety — we’re never going to see another hurricane named Katrina, or even Bob, again. And the “H” name — Henri in 1991 — was next on the list when the storm struck.Correct. “The Perfect Storm” was a 2000 movie starring George Clooney and New England’s own Mark Wahlberg, based on a book of the same name by Sebastian Junger. We’re getting a little off-topic, here, though."}, {"title": "Authorities Eye Toxic Algae In Deaths Of Family And Dog On California Hike", "text": "Authorities are now looking at toxic algae blooms as the possible cause for the deaths of a family and their dog during a hike in California this week.John Gerrish and Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and Oski, the family’s golden retriever, were found dead on a remote hiking trail along the Merced River in the Sierra National Forest Tuesday after a family friend reported them missing.As officials speculated about what caused the deaths ― and considered the possibility of poisonous gases from old mines in the area ― the spot where the family was found was treated as a hazmat site. However, that declaration was lifted Wednesday and investigators are now testing for any toxic algae blooms in the water.“I don’t believe it’s connected to a mine,” Mariposa County Sheriff Jeremy Briese told the Fresno Bee. He said the closest mine was some 3 miles from where the bodies were found.“We won’t rest until we figure it out,” the sheriff added.Authorities are awaiting the results of autopsy and toxicology tests.Kristie Mitchell, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, called the deaths a “very unusual, unique situation.” There were “no signs of trauma, no obvious cause of death. There was no suicide note,” said Mitchell, per AP.Sidney Radanovich, a friend of the family, described the couple as avid hikers who were particularly fond of exploring the area.“They were such a loving couple,” Radanovich told The San Francisco Chronicle. He said Gerrish, a San Francisco-based software designer, loved to show Miju “all sorts of things and explain them to her.”"}, {"title": "Biden EPA To Ban Chlorpyrifos, A Pesticide Linked To Brain Damage In Children", "text": "The Biden administration will ban the use of chlorpyrifos on all food crops, citing potential risks to human health. The common insecticide has been applied to a variety of crops since the 1960s, including broccoli and cranberries, and has been linked to learning disabilities in children.The Environmental Protection Agency announced the move on Wednesday, reversing a 2017 decision by the Trump administration. For years, agricultural giants and the chemical industry have battled with environmentalists, public health experts and farmworkers over the future use of the chemical.EPA Administrator Michael Regan called the move “overdue.”“Ending the use of chlorpyrifos on food will help to ensure children, farmworkers, and all people are protected from the potentially dangerous consequences of this pesticide,” he said in a statement. “After the delays and denials of the prior administration, EPA will follow the science and put health and safety first.”That science indicates the chemical can cause irreversible harm. Children exposed to organophosphate pesticides, including chlorpyrifos, have an increased risk for abnormal neurodevelopment, including persistent loss of intelligence and behavior problems, studies have shown. Even low-dose exposure, particularly in the womb, has been found to harm brain development, leading to higher risk of disorders such as autism.The Obama administration began the process of barring agricultural use of the chemical in November 2015, only to have the Trump administration defy the recommendation of EPA scientists and refuse to take chlorpyrifos off the market.Wednesday’s decision is a response to a federal appeals court’s April ruling that the EPA either prove chlorpyrifos’s safety or halt its use altogether. The ban is slated to take effect in six months.“Finally, we will protect future generations by stopping this acutely toxic pesticide from being sprayed into the air we breathe, the water we drink and the fruits and vegetables we eat,” Tracy Gregoire, a project coordinator at the Learning Disabilities Association of America, one of several groups that sued Trump’s EPA over its refusal to ban the pesticide, said in a statement Wednesday.Chlorpyrifos, produced by Dow Chemical Co. and commonly known by its trade name Lorsban, is used in nearly 100 countries on more than 50 different crops. It was largely banned in 2000 for at-home use in the U.S. but has remained a go-to product on American farms."}, {"title": "Biden Faces Mounting Pressure To Yank Line 3 Oil Pipeline Permits", "text": "The White House is facing mounting pressure from Democrats to yank federal permits for Line 3, the controversial oil pipeline under construction in Minnesota.Eight Democratic senators and nearly two dozen House members criticized the Biden administration for allowing pipeline giant Enbridge to continue building Line 3 across wetlands in a letter sent Monday that HuffPost viewed. The lawmakers say President Joe Biden should suspend the Clean Water Act permits the Trump administration had granted until the Army Corps of Engineers completes a more thorough analysis of the potential environmental impacts.“The Trump Administration aggressively expanded fossil fuel infrastructure projects under a new policy of ‘energy dominance’ and severely limited public scrutiny on those projects,” said the letter, which Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) led.Carrying out a new assessment, they said, would “ensure a full and significant environmental review that includes assessing the project’s real costs on environment, public health, and climate change and ensuring the public is aware of those costs.”The Army Corps conducted “almost no independent evaluation of the risk of oil spills at the crossings it authorized, despite the fact that the route for Line 3 crosses 227 lakes and rivers, including the headwaters of the Mississippi River and rivers that feed directly into Lake Superior,” the letter said.The lawmakers complained that the Army Corps’s final permitting analysis last November of how the pipeline would affect climate change came down to “a single paragraph in which greenhouse gas emissions from construction and operation of a major tar sands pipeline are dismissed as ‘de minimis.’” They asked instead that the administration examine how the potential for serious drought across the region could “exacerbate the environmental costs of an oil spill.”Yet “the most serious areas of omission” appeared in the infrastructure agency’s failure to adequately consult local tribes, many of whose members have led the ongoing protests against the pipeline’s construction, braving assaults from police and private security and blasts of debris from deliberately low-flying federal helicopters.The lawmakers singled out the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources’ June approval of Enbridge’s plan to pump 10 times more water away from the construction site than was approved last November.“The magnitude of this transfer will have grave implications for the ecosystems near the pipeline, including the wild rice beds that are a staple food for the Anishinaabe people and core to the way of life,” the letter read. “It is our understanding that the Red Lake and White Earth tribes were not consulted on this dramatic increase, despite the fact that it will directly impact them.”The White House referred questions to the Army Corps, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a lengthy statement, Enbridge said its “pipelines have coexisted with Minnesota’s most sacred and productive wild rice waters for over seven decades” and insisted it has “demonstrated ongoing respect for tribal sovereignty” and “a commitment to addressing climate change with real action.”Enbridge, based in Canada, boasted earlier this year that the 1,031-mile pipeline is nearly finished, with just a portion of the 337-mile stretch through Minnesota still awaiting completion. In June, the Biden administration defended the water permits granted to the pipeline during the Trump administration and asked a federal judge to toss out a complaint from Native Americans and environmental groups challenging the project.Support for the project has thus far become one of the darkest bruises to Biden’s nascent climate record, which includes reducing how much a coal company has to pay in federal royalties and approving a massive wave of new oil and gas drilling permits on public lands."}, {"title": "Massive Python Filmed Popping Out Of Shelf In Australian Supermarket", "text": "Looks like dinner’s going to be bland this week!Shoppers looking for seasoning at a supermarket in Australia on Monday had to contend with a large snake that had taken up residence in the herbs and spices section.The python was seen on video peeking its head out of a shelf at the Woolworths store in Glenorie, a suburb northwest of Sydney.“I was browsing and turned to my left and he had come out and his face was about 20cm (8 inches) from mine, just looking at me,” Helaina Alati, a shopper, told 7 News.Alati, as fortune would have it, is a former volunteer snake catcher, and offered to remove the intruder.“It was super mellow, not aggressive at all.

But that hasn’t been enforced in recent years if the worker isn’t planning to enter the enclosure, he said.“We still enforce it strictly whenever somebody gets in with the gator but, of course, going forward, we will be back to strictly enforcing it with any interactions with the gator for that very reason,” Richins said.After pulling the handler into its pen, the alligator began whipping around and kept its jaws clamped on her as she struggled to break free.One of the guests, later identified as Donnie Wiseman, yelled “We’ve got trouble in here!” before jumping into the water and climbing on top of the reptile.Another bystander ushered the children away as they cried, the video showed.Wiseman got the alligator pinned, and the handler calmly gave him and another man, Todd Christopher, instructions to help her escape from the pool. Wiseman stayed on top of the reptile until after the woman was free.Christopher’s wife, who has a background in nursing, then began performing first aid before emergency crews arrived.Richins said the handler underwent surgery and is taking antibiotics. The West Valley City business said Sunday she is “doing well and is in recovery.” According to its website, Scales & Tails Utah is a family-run operation that provides educational presentations on reptiles, birds, spiders and scorpions.It hailed the visitors who rushed to the handler’s aid.“These gentlemen could have stayed in the safety zone as most of us would, but instead jumped into the situation, of their own volition, and helped secure the alligator,” the company said in a statement. “Their help, combined with the training of our staff member, probably saved her life and her limbs.”Eppolito is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

In Klamath Falls, roofers worked in blistering heat and thick smoke from nearby wildfires “with little to no shade and no breaks for a long period of time,” one complaint read. At a job site in Clackamas, workers reportedly installed fencing without access to fresh water and with only a total of 35 minutes of breaks throughout the day.The devastating heat wave, which killed more than 100 people in Oregon alone, offers a sobering glimpse at what lies ahead for outdoor laborers. Without an aggressive global effort to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, extreme heat will wreak havoc on construction, agricultural, extraction, delivery and other outdoor sectors, warns a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists.The report, published on Tuesday, concludes that if climate change continues unchecked, the number of days outdoor workers in the U.S. are exposed to hazardous heat could quadruple by mid-century. Up to $55.4 billion in annual earnings would be put at risk. And it would come with dire inequities ― of the approximately 32 million outdoor workers in the United States, more than 40% are non-white.That U.S. laborers are still suffering due to a lack of appropriate protections is nothing short of “cruel,” said Rachel Licker, the report’s lead author and a climate scientist at UCS.“That’s often the tragedy with these injuries and deaths is that they’re typically preventable,” she said. “It’s about affording people, oftentimes, basic human rights — access to shade, drinking water, the ability to take a break when they’re on the job — so they’re not in a position of having to choose between their health and a paycheck.”The report, titled “Too Hot to Work,” builds upon the nonprofit advocacy organization’s 2019 analysis on climate-fueled extreme heat. Combining county-level forecasts of hazardous heat days with U.S. Census data, the organization calculated the number of outdoor workdays and wages that could be lost under different warming scenarios. Southern states, including Louisiana, Florida and Texas, as well as major agricultural producers like California, are forecast to be among the hardest hit.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employers limit and even halt outdoor work when temperatures reach specific extremes, but those guidelines are not enforceable. The new report advocates for both aggressive climate action as well as workplace safety requirements to protect workers from the risks of heat-related illness.“We need, really, a kind of one-two punch on this issue,” Licker said. “On the one hand, we are taking aggressive action to ramp down heat-trapping emissions so that we can limit the increase in extreme heat days across the country, and the study shows that we can really prevent significant increases if we take action now. At the same time, we need to be enacting mandatory measures to protect workers at the federal and state level.”Along with the report, UCS published an interactive mapping tool that allows users to explore the impacts of future extreme heat on outdoor laborers at the county level.There is currently no federal standard that protects workers from heat, either indoors or outdoors. Only a few states, including California and Washington, have permanent protections. Oregon adopted temporary requirements following the historic June heatwave.The Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, a bill that Democrats introduced in June and that’s named after a California farmworker who died of a heat stroke after picking grapes in 105-degree temperatures, would direct the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish and enforce a federal heat standard. UCS supports the legislation.The timely analysis comes on the heels of a dire United Nations assessment that concluded human-caused climate change is currently affecting weather in “every region across the globe” and warned that past and future emissions have locked in changes that will prove “irreversible” over centuries to millennia. Heat waves are just one of the many impacts forecast to worsen in the coming years and decades.Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA official and current worker health and safety program director for the National Employment Law Project, said OSHA’s small size and inadequate funding, along with industry lobbying during Republican administrations, have prevented the agency from issuing more workforce health standards and better carrying out its mission. The climate threat is compounding the risks of what are already dangerous jobs, making it all the more important for OSHA to prioritize setting basic requirements for all companies to implement during high-heat days, said Berkowitz, who is not involved in the UCS report.“Of course, the majority of these workers are workers of color,” she said. “Their lives matter too.”Dave Jamieson contributed to this report."}, {"title": "19 Mistakes People Make With Houseplants", "text": "If you follow interior design influencers or otherwise keep up with trends in home decor, you’ve likely noticed the mania around houseplants. Indeed, over the past few years, millennials in particular have developed a love affair with all things green.But as newcomers to the indoor plant world quickly learn, keeping your indoor flora alive can be challenging. The leaves may turn brown, wilt away, develop spots or otherwise fail to thrive. Still, there’s no need to despair!“Plant parents of all skill levels have trouble with houseplants at one time or another, so don’t worry or be afraid to try, try again!” Liam Heeks, manager of Tula Plants & Design, told HuffPost.To help new and aspiring plant parents, we asked experts to share the biggest mistakes they see people make with their houseplants. Read on for 19 approaches to avoid (and their advice for getting it right).“I’d say the most common mistake that people make is purchasing plants based on how they look, or how trendy they are, instead of getting plants that can thrive in the quality of light they have in their homes.” ― Hilton Carter, plant and interior stylist and author of “Wild Creations,” “Wild Interiors” and “Wild At Home”“I’ve seen new plant parents get overly excited and go out and purchase too many varieties of plants at once. They end up losing a lot of those plants because it gets overwhelming trying to figure out which plant needs what type of care. My suggestion is to start with one or two new plants, learn about those and help them thrive, and then continue to add one new plant at a time.” ― Rachel Mayo, photographer and creator behind Grow in the Light“You want to keep your plant’s environment as stable as possible. Most houseplants, just like us, are most comfortable between 65-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Extreme cold or hot fluctuations in temperatures can stress them out. Do your best to avoid placing plants near temperature hazards like vents, radiators, and exterior doors or open windows, which might create hot or cold drafts of air.” ― Erin Marino, editorial lead at The Sill“Overwatering is one of the easiest ways to kill a houseplant. You may be tempted to water your plants on a strict schedule, but the best bet is to only water when needed. Always check the soil before watering. If it’s still moist, wait to water. Remember, it’s easier to add water than to remove it. I wait until I see signs of thirst like dropping or wrinkled leaves before watering.” ― Marino“Plants that are overwatered may lead to yellowing of leaves, fungus/fungus gnats or root rot. A good tip for making sure you don’t overwater is using a moisture meter like the Sustee moisture meter and watering your plant once your meter goes from blue to white. You can also check by sticking your finger into the top few inches of soil, and also lifting up the pot to feel the weight. For plants like calathea who like to be kept consistently moist, water when you feel like the soil is a wrung out sponge!” ― Heeks“Another mistake I’ve noticed is forgetting to fertilize plants. Many people think they can thrive off of water, alone. Plants need nourishment, just like humans do.” ― Mayo“Keep in mind seasonal changes. For example, most houseplants need less water in the winter when they’re semi-dormant and receiving less sun.” ― Marino“A lot of people are so scared to overwater their plants that they end up not using enough water to saturate the root system, resulting in a droopy, sad plant. If your pot has a drainage hole ― which it should ― don’t be afraid to really soak the soil on watering days.” ― Gabby Santiago, resident “plant doctor” with Rooted“Underwatering may leave your leaves brown and crunchy, or your root systems may dry up and die back. Make sure to feel your soil before watering and know what conditions your plants thrive in. Watering schedules will change throughout the seasons, especially for cacti and succulents, so it’s best to do a little bit of research on your plant’s native habitat and growing conditions recommended for in the home.” ― Heeks“Many people don’t research the proper soil that their plants require. Some plants prefer soil that drains easily, some do not, etc.” ― Mayo“A common mistake plant parents make is wanting to put a plant somewhere it may look nice but is not healthy for the plant. You might have a spot that you think would be great for a plant, but haven’t considered the conditions the plant needs to grow. Will the plant have enough light? Is the temperature of the space what the plant needs? Plants cannot thrive in all settings, so I like to determine what a plant needs before giving it a home.” ― Marcus Bridgewater aka Garden Marcus“Repotting does not always mean moving your plant into a bigger planter ― sometimes it simply means changing your plant’s potting mix to provide it with new nutrients from fresh mix. However, if your plant has overgrown its current planter, you can choose a new pot that’s only slightly larger in size. Upsizing should be a gradual process throughout the years. You do not want your plant swimming in potting mix, which can lend itself to overwatering (to saturate all that extra soil that the roots don’t even reach), and potentially root rot.” ― Marino“You want to make sure to be repotting when you notice the following: If you see roots growing out of the bottom of the pot, the plant is root bound, new growth seems stunted, or it is the growing season and you are not seeing growth. You would want to hold off on repotting when the growth is coming out beautiful and wild! If your plant is growing well but needs managing, I recommend pruning versus repotting. We recommend sizing up your pot 1 to 2 inches bigger than the pot the plant is currently in, but if you are not going to upsize, a soil refresh can be very beneficial!” ― Heeks“A common mistake that plant parents make is giving the plant too much or too little light. Make sure that the conditions you are keeping your plants in match (or to your best abilities) the growing conditions required for the species. You can always supplement light with grow lights if you love cacti like me and have a north-facing window!” ― Heeks“Know what your space has to offer in terms of light before condemning a plant to certain death. If you live in a low-light apartment and bring home a plant that requires bright, direct light to thrive, chances are, it’s going to die on you.” ― Santiago“Never water on a schedule. However, check your plant on a schedule. If you’ve had a week of cloudy days, your plant won’t be photosynthesizing as much so it may not need water on the ‘scheduled’ day. Always check for moisture using your finger for smaller containers and a wooden dowel for larger containers. Push the dowel all the way to the bottom of the container and after letting it set for a minute or so, check the stick when you pull it out. If it is wet on the bottom of the stick, don’t water. If it’s dry, it is probably time to give your plant a drink. What’s going on at the top of a container, may not be what is happening in the bottom.” ― Lisa Eldred-Steinkopf aka The Houseplant Guru“The most natural way to ask about watering is ‘how often do I water this plant?’ but the answer (e.g., once a week) is typically interpreted to mean that frequency is predetermined by plant type. But water usage varies based on many factors such as light, temperature, humidity, air flow, and soil type ― and these will differ for every person. A better approach is to regularly observe your plant’s soil moisture level to determine when to water. All plants will be ready for watering at one of these three soil moisture levels: When the soil is completely dry (cacti, succulents), when the soil is midway, partially dry (most tropical foliage plants), and when the soil is just slightly dry (sometimes referred to as ‘keep evenly moist’ ― many thin-leaved plants, most notably the maidenhair fern). You will eventually get the rhythm of when your plant reaches the appropriate level of dryness.” ― Darryl Cheng, author of “The New Plant Parent” and creator of House Plant Journal“One mistake I think new plant parents make is not having a container with a drainage hole. Using shards or pebbles for ‘drainage’ material does not work and is a hinderance to drainage. Drilling a hole is easy to do with a masonry or diamond-tipped drill bit. It is too hard to determine whether your plant has enough water to entirely moisten the root ball or too much water which is drowning the plant when it is in a pot without drainage.” ― Eldred-Steinkopf“After finding a suitable place for a plant, new plant parents may not realize they need to rotate their plant in its place, especially if it needs a lot of sun and only one side of it is facing sunlight.” ― Bridgewater“A common mistake I frequently come across is that people often forget about protecting indoor plants from bugs and fungus! Just because a plant isn’t outside doesn’t mean it is safe from these ailments that can decrease plant longevity, growth, and overall look. As an easy fix, I recommend adding a product like Garden Safe brand fungicide to your plant parenting routine, spraying every week to two weeks to control houseplant bugs and prevent fungal infection.” ― Gladys Mbofung-Curtis, a plant scientist with Spectrum Home & Garden“Most people who hear ‘bright indirect light’ fixate on the word ‘indirect’ and believe that the best place for this kind of plant is anywhere that avoids direct sun. But in doing so, they usually end up putting the plant too far from the window, where the indirect light is much too weak, leading to poor growth and general dissatisfaction. Instead of just saying ‘bright indirect light,’ I try to be more specific about where to put the plant: First, put it as close to your largest window as possible ― where it will have the widest possible view of the sky. Second, if the duration of direct sun exposure will exceed two or three hours, then the ideal thing to do would be to block it with a white sheer curtain. This is the reason why people who have exceptionally large windows and/or skylights have nicer plants in the long run. They only need to keep up with watering. If your windows are small or highly obstructed, most plants will grow slowly and maybe poorly no matter how well you’re following watering instructions.” ― Cheng“Always water until the water runs out of the drainage hole and water all the way around the plant, not in just the same area each time. We want to ensure the entire root ball is moistened. If you only water on one side each time, especially with large plants, the roots on the other side may not be getting any water at all and then it is a mystery why half the plant may be dying. This pertains to cacti and other succulents, as well as ferns and other moisture loving plants. The time between waterings is the key. You may not water the cactus or succulent for a few weeks but the fern may need water the next week.” ― Eldred-Steinkopf“It might sound silly, but less is more when it comes to caring for most houseplants. Plants are hardier than we think! They can tolerate a bit of neglect. Specifically, during the long winter months when most indoor plants are dormant, you’ll want to water them less and set your expectations for your plants to lose a few leaves ― a natural, seasonal shedding process that happens when plants don’t get enough sunlight to support their current leaves.” ― Marino“Try not to obsess over every little thing, because an overbearing plant parent often becomes a plant killer. Trust us ― most of your plants are perfectly fine without you. Tending to them once a week is usually enough to keep them happy.” ― Santiago“If you kill a plant, it isn’t the end of the world. That is how you learn. Don’t be too hard on yourself. I’ve led many plants to their death. The key is paying attention to your plants and meeting their needs. No one is born with a green thumb, but with experience and some research, you can develop one.” ― Eldred-SteinkopfQuotes have been edited and condensed for clarity."}, {"title": "Western States Face First Colorado River Water Cuts As Megadrought Drains Reservoirs", "text": "Arizona, Nevada and two Mexican states that rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and irrigation will face cuts to their supply next year as a prolonged megadrought parches the American West, leaves reservoirs depleted and casts doubt over the future of vital freshwater reserves as climate change worsens.On Monday, the federal Bureau of Reclamation declared a water shortage at Lake Mead as water levels fell below the 1,075-foot threshold that triggers mandatory reductions in the amount of water the nation’s largest reservoir dispenses to millions in the lower Colorado River Basin.The cutbacks mark the first time in Lake Mead’s 86-year history that demand for water has eclipsed what federal authorities can safely supply, even in a system where reservoirs store four times more water than what flows annually down the river. The tier-one shortage — the worst designation, based on the lake’s record-low water levels — paints a troubling picture of the hardships to come as the Southwest’s growing population competes for dwindling resources while temperatures rise and precipitation falls due to soaring fossil fuel emissions. The region’s stored water capacity dropped to 40% last month, down from 49% a year earlier.The shortage is a sign that the reservoir’s “bathtub ring” — the area of previously submerged rock that appears white due to mineral deposits — will remain to mark a high-water era unlikely to return.Three U.S. states share the river’s lower basin, but California will avoid cutbacks next year thanks to legal rights dating back more than a century that privilege the most populous state in the nation’s claim to Colorado River water. Farmers in Arizona and Nevada, as well as in Mexico’s Baja California and Sonora states, will face shortages starting in 2022.“The Colorado River is absolutely in crisis with this 20-year drought persisting, but we’ve gotten through it and effectively mitigated it so far by relying on reservoir storage,” said Jennifer Pitt, the Colorado River program director at the National Audubon Society. “We’ve been sipping our way through this to get through this, but as reservoirs drop and drop and drop, that’s not sustainable.”Cities in the affected area, including Phoenix and Tucson, won’t see any major changes, meaning it’s mostly agricultural communities that eke alfalfa, corn and other crops out of the red desert that will be forced to do more with less.The shortage in Nevada will affect the smallest area by far.The Colorado River Indian Tribes ― a federally recognized confederation of Mohave, Chemehuevi, Hopi and Navajo people ― volunteered to stop farming crops in the Arizona portion of their reservation to eliminate water use in exchange for payments from the state. Mostly white farmers across Pinal County, by contrast, are expected to receive some additional drilled water and reservoir water next year to make up for lost Colorado River water.Unlike in the United States, where the laws governing water rights date back to 19th-century mining claims that give older stakes first dibs, Mexico has no system of seniority and will implement 5% supply cuts across the board to irrigators in the Mexicali Valley.While the cuts will reduce risk of further shortages, Bureau of Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Touton said “we have not eliminated the potential for continued decline of these critically important reservoirs” and warned that “additional actions will likely be necessary in the very near future.”“At the turn of the millennium, our major reservoirs in the basin ― Lake Mead, and Lake Powell ― were nearly full. I remember being on a tour at Hoover Dam and standing at the top of the dam, leaning over and thinking I could touch the water because the water level was so high,” Touton said, noting her hometown was in the river basin. “Little did we know then that 2000 would be the start of what is now a 22-year drought.”Two months ago, the Bureau of Reclamation cut off water to farmers and tribes in a lush but increasingly dry valley on the border between California and Oregon. The decision stoked tensions between the mostly white farmers and Indigenous tribes, who lobbied for reductions in water distributed for irrigation in hopes of preserving water levels for endangered fish.In response to the federal cutbacks, farmers joined anti-government groups and threatened violence unless authorities restored water deliveries. To some, the incident amounted to “a new water war,” while others warned of “another Dust Bowl” looming, a repeat of the poverty and mass migration triggered by crop failures in the 1930s.Water rationing has become far more routine, and has gone far less remarked upon, in the more peripheral places where the U.S. flag flies. Native Americans, particularly those on reservations in the Southwest, comprise a huge portion of the 2 million people in the U.S. who still don’t have running water, making the country’s Indigenous minority 19 times more likely to lack indoor plumbing than members of the white majority, according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Water Alliance.In Puerto Rico, the largest remaining U.S. territorial possession, residents have routinely faced months of water rationing in recent years, with ratepayers going up to two days a week without being able to use their sinks, toilets or showers. As in the U.S. mainland, the shortages are largely driven by droughts, agribusiness giants that use as much water as they want, leaking pipes and saltwater intrusion as rising seas penetrate underground aquifers.The Senate’s recently passed bipartisan infrastructure deal includes billions in funding for water infrastructure, especially to tribes, and the restoration of forests and wetlands deemed crucial to natural water tables. Experts say those investments are a good start but are long overdue as problems from droughts compound.Among the consequences that could add up next year are water shortages bringing more hydroelectric dams across the West to a halt. To boot, most drought models consider the effect of reduced snowmelt in the mountains that feed the Colorado River. However, scientists also fear that temperatures could get so hot that the water evaporates, significantly amplifying droughts.“The biggest message we take from this is that the Colorado River Basin is ground zero for climate change in the U.S.,” said Kevin Moran, the senior director of the Environmental Defense Fund’s Colorado River program. “This should be a blaring wake-up call.”"}, {"title": "Wisconsin Doubles Wolf Hunt Quota Even After Biologists Warn Of Serious Risk To Population", "text": "After biologists warned that a planned second hunt this year of 130 wolves in Wisconsin could endanger the species in the state, wildlife officials more than doubled the kill quota to 300 animals.The move follows a botched slaughter in February, when hunters killed 216 wolves — more than 82% over the quota allowed. The decision last week by the board of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources completely ignored a recommendation by the agency’s own scientists to keep the hunt to 130 animals.“What is being called wolf management in this state is a revenge-driven assault perpetrated by legal dog-fighters, trophy killers, disingenuous special interests and their anti-wolf allies in the state legislature,” Paul Collins, the state director of the advocacy group Animal Wellness Action, said at a tense and emotional public hearing on Aug. 11 before the board vote.Some hunters, farmers and ranchers called for boosting the number to 500 animals.A July study from biologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison estimated that a third of all wolves in Wisconsin were decimated in that first hunt and by poaching, which usually increases in the wake of hunting.A second hunt after the last excessive kill raises serious “questions about sustainability” of the animals in the state, the study warned.Wisconsin’s Chippewa tribes are entitled to claim a portion of a wolf-kill quota under treaty rights. But the Chippewa, who consider the wolf sacred, won’t hunt them, fearing that further bloodlust in the fall hunt will massacre far too many wolves. Wisconsin hunters are allowed to trap the animals and run them down with snowmobiles and dog packs.“The hatred toward this being is based on myth,” John Johnson Jr., president of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, testified at the hearing. “You’ve had the functional equivalent of two seasons already this year. [But] nothing will dissuade the desire for more blood from our brother.”″[What] will be in short supply today is respect. Respect for science, respect for the tribal community, respect for the ma’iingan,” Johnson added, using the Chippewa term for “wolf.”It’s been a killing season on wolves in states such as Wisconsin and Idaho ever since the animals were delisted as an endangered species in October 2020 by the Trump administration.Adrian Treves, co-author of the wolf study and an environmental studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, called the plans for a second hunt “unwise,” particularly since the full impact of the February killings — which took place during breeding season — won’t likely be known for some time.The kill numbers appear to contradict the Department of Natural Resources’ “explicit objectives of no change in the wolf population,” Treves’ study noted. Wisconsin’s stated goal is to maintain a stable population of wolves, a top predator that helps sustain ecosystem health."}, {"title": "Coyote Attacks Child On Cape Cod Beach As Officials Warn Of Dangerous Encounters", "text": "A young child was attacked by a coyote on a Cape Cod beach in Massachusetts , but suffered no critical injuries.The child was bitten around the face, neck and shoulder Wednesday evening on North Herring Cove Beach within the Cape Cod National Seashore, and was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to the National Park Service. The child’s age was not provided.The coyote was killed by rangers, and it tested negative for rabies, according to officials.Rangers have reported several incidents of coyotes boldly approaching humans in the area this summer. That’s because coyotes become habituated to humans and are drawn to picnics and edible trash left behind, NPS officials warned.“This behavior starts with people feeding the coyotes intentionally by leaving food out, or inadvertently by not removing food scraps and packaging from the beach,” said an NPS statement.“This leads to the animals becoming habituated and bold in attempts to obtain food. When wild animals lose their fear of people, they behave unpredictably and aggressively, resulting in injuries to people and a sad ending for the habituated animal,” it added.Last month, two men on a boat came to the aid of a women, Marcy Sterlis, who was using a stick to fend off a “relentless” coyote on a Provincetown beach.In a video shot by one of the men, fisherman Andrew DeCarton, Sterlis can be heard crying “help me” while the coyote follows her. The animal was eventually frightened off when DeCarton hit a paddle against the side of his boat, The Cape Cod Times reported.Sterlis wrote later on Facebook: “Major props to these guys for hearing my screams and responding ― this coyote was relentless, and I don’t know what I would have done without them.”Officials in San Francisco, meanwhile, are seeking the identity of a woman who was videotaped feeding raw meat to wild coyotes on Bernal Hill in the city. It’s illegal to feed wild animals.“Feeding coyotes and any wildlife, makes the wildlife lose their natural wariness. They begin to see people as a source of food,” Virginia Donohue, executive director at San Francisco Animal Care and Control, told Fox News 2.A coyote habituated to humans was euthanized last month after repeatedly approaching toddlers at San Francisco Botanical Garden.“We were certainly very alarmed to see them approaching children. That’s not natural behavior,” said Donohue."}, {"title": "It's Been So Hot In Sicily That Snails Cooked Alive In Their Shells", "text": "A brutal heat wave across Italy has been so severe that snails in the Sicilian town of Floridia have been found dead after sizzling inside their shells.“See, this one is cooked inside,” Giusy Pappalardo, a farmer of snails used in the region’s cuisine, told The New York Times in a story published Friday. She was holding one shell amid a field of the dead creatures.The heat caused the snails’ feet to burn as they moved across the ground, Pappalardo said. Some snails managed to burrow into the soil, but she wasn’t optimistic about their chances, either.A local temperature reading in the town this week rose to nearly 124 degrees Fahrenheit, which, if officially confirmed, would be the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe.The highest official temperature ever recorded in Europe was 48 degrees Celsius ― 118.4 degrees Fahrenheit ― in Athens, Greece, in 1977, according to The Associated Press.Randy Cerveny of the World Meteorological Organization spoke to the AP earlier this week after a local temperature reading in Sicily hit 119.84, which would also be a record if confirmed. Cerveny cast some doubt on the accuracy of that temperature, but said the WMO was “not going to dismiss it” and would be examining the reading.By any measure, though, temperatures in the region have been punishingly hot. In Floridia, dead snails were just one consequence of the blistering heat, along with lemons rotting on the tree and blackouts caused by high air conditioning use.Elsewhere in Sicily and in other parts of Italy, wildfires worsened by hot and dry conditions have devastated communities. Fires have similarly torched parts of Greece and Turkey this summer.On Monday, a landmark United Nations report concluded it is “unequivocal” that human greenhouse gas emission “has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land” and has already caused “widespread and rapid changes” to the planet.Some future changes, the report found, are already locked in, though massive, drastic action could still prevent the absolute worst-case scenarios."}, {"title": "Rescuers Racing In Haiti As Storm Threatens To Follow Earthquake", "text": "LES CAYES, Haiti (AP) — The death toll from a magnitude 7.2 earthquake in Haiti soared on Sunday as rescuers raced to find survivors amid the rubble ahead of a potential deluge from an approaching tropical storm.Saturday’s earthquake left at least 724 dead and 2,800 injured in the Caribbean island nation, with thousands more displaced from their destroyed or damaged homes. Survivors in some areas were forced to shelter in streets or soccer fields with their few salvaged belongings while overloaded hospitals scrambled to help those who were injured.Yet the devastation could soon worsen with the coming of Tropical Storm Grace, which was predicted to reach Haiti late Monday or early Tuesday, bringing the potential for torrential rain, flooding and landslides. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with up to 15 inches in some southern parts of the island they share.The earthquake struck the southwestern part of the hemisphere’s poorest nation, almost razing some towns and triggering landslides that hampered rescue efforts in a country already grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, a presidential assassination and a wave of gang violence.The epicenter was about 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of the capital of Port-au-Prince, the U.S. Geological Survey said, and aftershocks continued to jolt the area Sunday.In the badly damaged coastal town of Les Cayes, some families salvaged their few belongings and spent the night at an open-air football pitch. On Sunday morning, people lined up to buy what little was available: bananas, avocados and water at a local street market.Some in the town praised God for surviving the earthquake, and many went to the city’s cathedral, which appeared outwardly undamaged even if the priests’ residence was destroyed.“We only have Jesus now,” said Johanne Dorcely, 58, whose house was destroyed. “If it wasn’t for Jesus, I wouldn’t be able to be here today.”Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a one-month state of emergency for the whole country and said he was rushing aid to areas where towns were destroyed and hospitals overwhelmed. A former senator rented a private airplane to move injured people from Les Cayes to Port-au-Prince for medical assistance.“The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,” said Henry. “We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people.”Sunday’s count from Haiti’s Office of Civil Protection raised the previous death toll from 304 dead. The agency said more than 7,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 5,000 damaged. Hospitals, schools, offices and churches were also affected.Hospitals were overwhelmed at a moment when Haiti has been struggling with the pandemic and a lack of resources to deal with it. The country of 11 million people received its first batch of U.S.-donated coronavirus vaccines only last month via a United Nations program for low-income countries.Medical workers from across the region were scrambling to help as hospitals in Les Cayes started running out of space to perform surgeries.“Basically, they need everything,” said Dr. Inobert Pierre, a pediatrician with the nonprofit Health Equity International, which oversees the St. Boniface Hospital, about two hours from Les Cayes.“Many of the patients have open wounds and they have been exposed to not-so-clean elements,” added Pierre, who visited two hospitals in Les Cayes — one with some 200 patients, the other with around 90. “We anticipate a lot of infections.”Pierre’s medical team was taking some patients to St. Boniface Hospital to undergo surgery, but with just two ambulances, they could transport just four patients at a time.The earthquake also struck just over a month after President Jovenel Moïse was shot to death in his home, sending the country into political chaos. His widow, Martine Moïse, who was seriously wounded in the attack, posted a message on Twitter calling for unity among Haitians: “Let’s put our shoulders together to bring solidarity.”As he boarded a plane bound for Les Cayes, Henry said he wanted “structured solidarity” to ensure the response was coordinated to avoid the confusion that followed the devastating 2010 earthquake, when aid was slow to reach residents after.U.S. President Joe Biden authorized an immediate response and named USAID Administrator Samantha Power to oversee the U.S effort to help Haiti.Power announced Sunday that USAID was sending a search and rescue team from Virginia at the request of Haiti’s government. The 65-person team will bring specialized tools and medical supplies to assist with the disaster response, Power said on Twitter.Working with USAID, the U.S. Coast Guard said a helicopter was transporting medical personnel from the Haitian capital to the quake zone and evacuating the injured back to Port-au-Prince. Lt. Commander Jason Nieman, a spokesman, said another helicopter was being sent from the Bahamas, along with other aircraft and ships.Already on the scene were several members of Cuba’s 253-member health care mission to Haiti, and the socialist nation’s state media showed photos of them giving first aid to victims injured by the quake.The North Carolina-based aid group Samaritan’s Purse announced Sunday it would airlift 13 disaster response specialists and 31 tons of emergency supplies to Haiti. Those include shelter materials and water filtration units.Humanitarian workers said gang activity in the seaside district of Martissant, just west of the Haitian capital, also was complicating relief efforts.“Nobody can travel through the area,” Ndiaga Seck, a UNICEF spokesman in Port-au-Prince, said by phone. “We can only fly over or take another route.”Seck said information about deaths and damage was slow coming to Port-au-Prince because of spotty internet service, but UNICEF planned to send medical supplies to two hospitals in the south, in Les Cayes and Jeremie.Haiti, where many live in tenuous circumstances, is vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake in 2018 killed more than a dozen people.The magnitude 7.0 quake of 2010 hit closer to densely populated Port-au-Prince and caused widespread destruction. Haiti’s government put the death toll at more than 300,000, while a report commissioned by the U.S. government placed it between 46,000 and 85,000.Collin Binkley reported from Boston. AP writer Trenton Daniel contributed from New York."}, {"title": "Activists Call It A ‘False Solution.’ But UN Scientists Say We Need To Suck Up CO2.", "text": "A United Nations-led panel of scientists delivered a grim prognosis this week: The planet is, on average, 2 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it was in the last century, and even if we magically halted all emissions tomorrow, humanity has spewed enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to lock in dangerous climate effects for the next 30 years.Avoiding climate catastrophe at this point would require removing carbon from the atmosphere. The Earth naturally absorbs carbon when plants and algae photosynthesize. But the long-awaited report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a consortium of scientists representing virtually every country, makes clear that averting catastrophe now will require us to develop measurable, surefire ways to suck CO2 from the air and return it to the ground.Many of the tools scientists say we’ll most likely need, however, are nascent. And this approach has been controversial among environmentalists, who fear that fossil fuel interests would have policymakers focus on draining atmospheric CO2 so the pumping and burning of oil and gas can continue.But carbon removal experts say the new U.N. report should put to rest the idea that cutting emissions alone will be sufficient to forestall disaster.“We will fail to hit 1.5 degrees without CO2 removal,” said Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, referring to the threshold beyond which climate change is forecast to be devastating. “That’s it. That’s just math.”The IPCC isn’t scheduled to release its projections showing what policy pathways countries can take to rapidly cut emissions until next March.But the various approaches to cleaning up centuries’ worth of accumulated carbon will likely rely on a suite of options, ranging from mixing rocks into soil to help capture carbon to two technologies best known by their acronyms: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, and direct air capture, or DAC.An example of BECCS would be a facility that grows trees, which suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via photosynthesis before they are harvested and burned to produce energy. Instead of venting that smoke back into the atmosphere, technology captures the CO2 from smokestacks and pumps it underground. DAC technology, on the other hand, mostly looks like giant fans that vacuum carbon from the sky, attach it to calcium particles via a chemical reaction, and inject the captured substance back into the Earth.Both technologies work, at least on a small scale. But they carry serious drawbacks. To remove significant sums of carbon at scale with BECCS would require huge areas of land and vast amounts of water, competing for space with food crops, natural habitats and human homes ― all of which are expected to face added stress as the world continues to heat up.And DAC, at least in its present form, is expensive. The Swiss startup Climeworks, one of the world’s most advanced DAC companies, pegs the costs per metric ton of carbon it removes at between $500 and $600. That’s largely because the technology requires loads of energy. A 2019 study in the journal Nature Communications found that DAC, at scale, would consume a full quarter of global energy supplies by 2100. At a moment when the world is struggling to replace fossil fuels with zero-carbon alternatives, the very concept of DAC seems to skeptics like taking out a loan to pay down a debt.The land-use issues facing BECCS may remain challenging. Given current constraints on land use and infrastructure to carry captured carbon from the source to storage areas, the United States could remove only 100 metric tons of CO2 per year using BECCS, a 2018 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimated. That’s equal to just one year’s worth of emissions reductions from converting coal plants to natural gas.Studies into what’s called “enhanced weathering,” where mixing certain types of crushed rock dust into soil pulls carbon into the ground, remain relatively few. The Department of Energy issued a call for more research last October. One paper, published last summer by the University of Sheffield, suggested the technique could pull 2 gigatons of carbon per year at scale, equal to more than 500 coal plants’ annual emissions.But DAC deployed at scale around the world could remove up to 5 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year, a 2018 study in Environmental Research Letters found. That’s equal to the annual emissions of all the coal-fired power plants in China and India combined.The cavernous geology under much of the U.S., particularly in regions most ravaged by centuries of fossil fuel extraction such as Appalachia, means the country has enormous potential to store captured carbon. The U.S. Geological Survey’s first comprehensive assessment of the country’s storage potential pegged the mean figure at about 3,000 gigatons.The cost remains a big hurdle. But early pilot-scale projects indicate the price per metric ton of carbon removed could drop to somewhere between $94 and $232. By 2040, that number could fall below $60 per ton, a 2019 paper in the journal Joule estimated. Those price decreases, however, depend on subsidies and other policies making a DAC supply chain profitable enough to be worth building.The Biden administration gave out $12 million in funding to research DAC in June. The infrastructure package currently making its way through Congress would earmark another $3.5 billion to set up regional DAC hubs, mirroring a policy recently pioneered by the British government.The primary federal policy creating a market for DAC, at this point, is the 45Q tax credit, which allows companies using carbon capture technology to write off captured CO2 to the tune of between $12 and $32 per metric ton, depending on what happens with the captured gas. The tax credit pays about $20 per metric ton for CO2 used in oil drilling, which means some of the earliest U.S. investments in DAC are by oil giants like Occidental Petroleum.Proposals to raise the payout for carbon that’s captured and stored underground to somewhere closer to $120 per ton are likely to make it into one of the final federal bills to fund infrastructure.State and regional policies could also be a boon. As yet, California’s low-fuel standard remains the world’s only major carbon-trading market that explicitly values DAC projects. Expanding others, such Canada’s carbon-trading market, could provide the technology another boost.Opposition to carbon removal technologies has grown as policies to support them gain momentum. Last month, more than 500 community groups and environmental advocates signed on to a letter to Biden and congressional leaders urging them against enacting new policies to promote carbon capture technology, including DAC.The criticism echoed long-standing concerns among environmentalists that carbon removal technology is mostly a means for polluters who oppose eliminating emissions altogether to make it hard or impossible to design policies to do so.“Artificial carbon removal is largely a sideshow when it comes to climate change,” Jonathan Foley, the climate scientist who runs the advocacy group Project Drawdown, wrote in a recent blog post. “At best, it may eventually grow into a minor solution. At worst, it’s a distraction from reducing emissions — and plays right into the fossil fuel industry’s hands.”But the latest IPCC report shows “that is wrong,” said Michael Thompson, a research fellow at American University’s Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy.“Carbon removal has to be part of the real work ahead, and I sincerely hope this report will help bring closure to that debate,” he said, adding that the political stigma has prevented progressive advocates from even engaging in discussions about how best to design policies to govern these technologies.“I hope this will be a wake-up call to climate justice groups that they need to come to the table and be part of this process, if not dominate the process on what carbon removal will be,” Thompson said.The vast majority of American voters reported having heard “very little” or “nothing at all” about carbon removal technologies in a May survey by the progressive pollster and think tank Data for Progress. About 44% of respondents admitted they didn’t know enough about the tools to say whether they held favorable or unfavorable opinions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the preferred carbon removal solution of environmentalists ― planting new trees and protecting existing forests ― enjoyed the most popularity, with over 70% of people in support.Trees and so-called nature-based solutions should be part of any mix of carbon removal policies. But Celina Scott-Buechler, the fellow at Data for Progress who wrote a paper for the think tank on what a progressive carbon removal policy could look like, pointed to recent wildfires in Oregon that torched woodlands set aside to store carbon.“As forest fires continue to rage and as other natural disasters continue to become stronger and less predictable, there needs to be a broad enough portfolio of carbon removal options such that we are not relying on plots of land that just end up burning,” she said. “The progressive environmental movement has decided that, with renewable energy, these technologies are good and we should be pushing for as much deployment as possible. But these other areas of newer technological advancement are still mistrusted.”Making it more profitable to suck carbon from the air and store it underground than to use it for oil drilling is likely key to building trust in the technology, and tax credit increases like those proposed for 45Q could be a promising first step, Thompson said.Noah Deich, president of the carbon removal advocacy group Carbon180, compared the current state of the technology to that of solar and wind when the first major IPCC assessment of climate science came out 31 years ago.“Back in 1990, the report was telling us that, of course, solar and wind are not ready to displace the fossil economy, but if we had started really really investing in those technologies then and started to limit the expansion of fossil fuels, we could have scaled those solutions much more quickly and we’d be in a much less dire situation today,” Deich said. “That’s the same story we’re hearing today for carbon removal. Fortunately we have time ― we just don’t have that much time.”Friedmann, the Columbia research scholar, compared carbon concentrations in the atmosphere to a ship taking on water, meaning carbon removal technology offers a way to escape to safety. The big IPCC report due out in March, he said, will tell us “whether we need 10 lifeboats or 50 lifeboats.”“What we know now is we need lifeboats,” Friedmann said."}, {"title": "July 2021 Was Officially The Hottest Month On Record", "text": "Between the wildfires, the floods, the droughts and the hurricane, it was hard to ignore climate change in July, which now has the unfortunate distinction of being the hottest month on record.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Friday that last month saw the highest temperatures since record keeping began 142 years ago.“In this case, first place is the worst place to be,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. “July is typically the world’s warmest month of the year, but July 2021 outdid itself as the hottest July and month ever recorded. This new record adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.”The combined land and ocean surface temperature was 1.67 degrees Fahrenheit (or 0.93 degree Celsius) above the 20th-century average of 60.4 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15.8 degrees Celsius). The hottest month on record had previously been tied between July 2016, July 2019 and July 2020, according to the NOAA.The picture is particularly bleak for the Northern Hemisphere, where the land temperature was 2.77 degrees Fahrenheit (or 1.54 degrees Celsius) above the 20th-century average.Earlier this week, a new 4,000-page report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put the global crisis in simple terms.“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” the report read.Scientists do not make such conclusive statements lightly. The report ― which resulted from the work of 234 scientists from 66 countries ― confirmed what the broader scientific community already knew: Humans are causing global warming, which is in turn amplifying extreme weather.And it’s going to get worse. The report stated that “every region” of the globe is projected to increasingly experience “concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers,” meaning effects like sweltering heat and flooding.The worst consequences can be avoided only with massive changes in human behavior led by governments in order to slow the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of land for agriculture, among other factors. Leaders from some 200 nations, plus Pope Francis, will address the issue in November at the U.N. Climate Change Conference, to be held in Glasgow, Scotland."}, {"title": "Major Wildfires Threatening Towns In Montana, California", "text": "LAME DEER, Mont. (AP) — Wildfires in Montana threatened rural towns and ranchland, and victims of a California blaze returned to their incinerated town even as the region faced another round of dangerous weather.Firefighters and residents scrambled to save hundreds of homes as flames continued to advance on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana.Since Sunday, the fire has carved its way through some 260 square miles (673 square kilometers) and prompted evacuation orders for thousands of people.As the fire raged across rugged hills and narrow ravines, tribal member Darlene Small helped her grandson move about 100 head of cattle to a new pasture, only to relocate them twice more as the flames from the Richard Spring fire bore down, she said Thursday. An extreme drought that’s blanketing the West has made matters worse by stunting vegetation untouched by fire.“They’ve got to have pasture where there’s water. If there’s no water, there’s no good pasture,” Small said. Particularly hard hit were some ranchers already depending on surplus grass after a fire burned them off their normal pasture last year, she said.Gusts and low humidity were creating extreme fire behavior as flames devoured brush, short grass and timber, fire officials said.The same conditions turned California’s Dixie Fire into a furious blaze that last week burned down much of the small town of Greenville in the northern Sierra Nevada. The fire that began a month ago has destroyed some 550 homes.On Thursday, residents were trying to cope with the magnitude of the losses.“Everything that I own is now ashes or twisted metal. That’s just all it is,” said Greenville resident Ken Donnell, who escaped with just the clothes on his back.Donnell said he was heart-broken but “by God, I’m gonna smile. Because you know, it just makes things a little bit better and a little bit better right now is a lot.”Sam Prentice, a firefighter for the USDA Forest Service battled the flames in Greenville on Aug. 5, when the town was leveled. He was not optimistic on Greenville’s ability to rebuild.“Essentially it starts to become an archeology site — kind of a testament to the fire era that we’re in right now,” said Prentice. “It’s daunting.”The fire had ravaged more than 800 square miles (well over 2,000 square kilometers) and continued to threaten more than a dozen rural and forest communities.Despite firefighting progress, it was 31% contained and fire officials warned that hot weather would continue and Northern California would see a red flag warning of critical fire weather beginning Friday afternoon. The weather would bring a chance of dry lightning that could spark new blazes even as crews continue trying to surround a number of other forest fires that were ignited by lightning last month.Hot, dry and weather with strong afternoon winds also propelled several fires in Washington state and similar weather was expected into the weekend, fire officials said.Unstable weather was forecast throughout the drought-stricken West, where more than 100 large fires were burning in more than a dozen states.In Montana, days of swirling winds spread flames in all directions, torching trees and blowing embers that flew across a dry landscape.The fire had crept within about a mile (3.2 kilometers) of the eastern edge of the evacuated town of Lame Deer, home to about 2,000 people, the tribal headquarters and several subdivisions.With 40-foot (12-meter) flames visible from parts of Lame Deer, firefighters worked into early Thursday morning to keep the blaze from destroying houses. None were reported lost, but officials continued assessing the damage.Climate change has made the Western United States warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more destructive, according to scientists.___Eugene Garcia in Greenville, California, contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Republican Claims About Biden’s Oil Leasing ‘Ban’ Fall Flat", "text": "For months, fossil fuel industry-allied Republicans have been up in arms about the Biden administration’s pause — which they’ve falsely dubbed a “ban” — on new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters.President Joe Biden’s “illegal ban has hurt workers and deprived Wyoming and other states of a principal source of revenue that they use for public education,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) declared in a June tweet.In reality, oil and gas production in Wyoming and across the West is recovering after the major hit it took during the coronavirus pandemic. Permits to drill for oil and gas on federal lands have increased under Biden’s watch and, according to an Associated Press review, are on pace to reach their highest level since the George W. Bush administration.Over Biden’s first five months in office, the number of rotary rigs drilling for oil and gas both on land and offshore jumped from 374 to 464, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data, and the number of active wells also climbed, from 835 in January to 950 in May.In Utah, drilling activity rivals the busiest days of the Trump administration, which boasted of achieving “energy dominance,” the Salt Lake Tribune reported last week. In Barrasso’s home state of Wyoming, the number of operating drill rigs has tripled since Biden implemented a leasing pause, WyoFile reported Wednesday— activity that the independent news outlet aptly noted “erodes fearful statements exclaimed by the energy industry, its supporters and communities reliant on extraction.”Biden announced the “pause” in January, shortly after taking office, pending the outcome of a review of the federal oil and gas leasing program. A federal judge struck down that pause in June and ordered the administration to resume leasing. The administration has said it is complying with the judge’s order and will soon release a preliminary report detailing the findings of its program review.But even the temporary pause had a “minimal” impact on Western economies, according to a new analysis from the Conservation Economics Institute, an Idaho-based think tank. The report found that the oil and gas industry has stockpiled enough federal leases in the five largest oil-producing states — New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Montana – to sustain drilling for decades, and that federal extraction accounts for just 6% of domestic oil production and 8% of natural gas.“Polluters cried economic duress when the Administration set about reforming a broken system, and this shows just how misleading those claims are,” Josh Axelrod, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which commissioned the report, said in a statement. “The pause on leasing federal lands is not an economic threat — industry is already sitting on a stockpile of leases that could yield drilling for well over half a century.”None of this, of course, has kept Republicans from continuing to parrot the talking points of an industry that’s helped finance their campaigns and get them elected to office.Biden’s leasing moratorium is “stifling Wyoming and America’s own domestic production of oil and gas” and “empowering OPEC,” the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) wrote in a post to Twitter this week after Democrats voted down her amendment to Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget resolution. The amendment sought to “protect American energy independence.”One Biden administration action that likely will negatively impact Wyoming, however, is the Interior Department’s decision to reduce royalty rates for one of America’s largest coal companies. In May, the Bureau of Land Management quietly approved Arch Resource’s request for royalty relief at two of its coal mines, West Elk in Colorado and Coal Creek in Wyoming. Royalties are fees that drilling and mining companies pay to extract fossil fuels from federal lands, and the money is split between the federal government and states.A lower royalty rate at Coal Creek will mean less money in Wyoming’s coffers.Biden asked OPEC this week to boost oil production in an attempt to halt rising domestic gas prices — a move that outraged progressives and conservatives alike. The request came just two days after a United Nations report reaffirmed the urgent threat of global climate change.Rather than pressuring OPEC, “Biden needs to focus on ending fossil fuel subsidies and stopping oil and gas expansion at home,” Collin Rees, a senior campaigner at the climate advocacy group Oil Change International, told HuffPost in an email."}, {"title": "Biden Asked OPEC To Pump More Oil. Is That Climate Denial?", "text": "On Wednesday, the White House asked the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to pump more oil in hopes of stemming the rise in gas prices in the United States.President Joe Biden administration’s request to increase production of a major source of planet-heating pollution came just days after the United Nations issued a dire new report on climate change, which begs the question: Is the president denying the reality of the global emissions crisis?Biden’s seven-month tenure abounds with climate contradictions. On the one hand, the Democrat has blocked a major pipeline project, revived U.S. carbon diplomacy, and requested unprecedented levels of climate spending from Congress. On the other, he’s charged ahead with other pipelines, approved more than 2,000 permits to drill for oil and gas on public lands, cut a coal company’s royalty payments, and asked Congress for significantly less money than experts say is needed to rapidly cut emissions. In short, he’s doing more than ever before on climate, and still very far from enough.While asking OPEC for more oil may look like a softer version of climate change denial than the last four years of U.S. leadership, what it really demonstrates is two far more pernicious forces preventing policymakers from taking rational steps to avoid disaster: inertia and inequality.In a country where a surprise $500 expense would thrust 57% of adults into debt, major fluctuations in commodities like gas prices pinch the most vulnerable first. The national average for gas prices has climbed over the past year, crossing the $3-per-gallon mark in May for the first time since 2014. The price for regular blend fuel hit $3.185 this week, up from $3.144 a month ago, according to AAA.Those cents add up for the vast majority of Americans who rely on a gas-powered automobile to get around. The price flux can also affect the cost of various household goods, which become more expensive to ship as fuel prices increase.They also make it difficult for the average person to think about the long-term potential advantages of short-term suffering, like paying more for gas to avoid disastrous climate effects in the future, especially when the policy causing that pain isn’t even designed specifically to deliver those benefits. In an economy where the price of basic needs like health care and housing is subject to investor speculation, it’s easier for most people to see a choice between real, immediate expenses and modest potential climate benefits in the long term, and decide that, on the latter, it’s better to roll the dice.In an email sent after this article was initially published, a White House official said the administration needs “to do two things at once: Achieve our climate goals while ensuring the energy transition is one that takes into account the interests of the middle class, who experience changes in energy prices very directly, and meet global energy needs as the economy recovers from the pandemic.”Inflated prices — which are starting to level off in some sectors of the economy, but remain worst in energy — pose a political threat to the president as his party tries to use its razor-thin majorities in Congress to fund new investments in electric vehicles and clean energy, mandate zero-carbon electricity, and inject billions into scientific research. And, while allowing prices to remain high may force some in the U.S. to lower their emissions by driving and consuming less, that burden will fall on the poorest people who, over the course of their lives, are responsible for far less greenhouse gas pollution than the wealthy, who can simply pay more without changing their behavior.That’s the definition of a regressive tax ― except that it wouldn’t even deliver the benefits of actual tax.France tried that in 2018. It imposed a new tax on diesel, aiming to raise money for its transition away from fossil fuels and incentivize French drivers to use less and opt for cleaner transportation. In response, the Yellow Vest protest movement ― named for the safety garb drivers keep in their vehicles to wear if they face trouble on the road ― erupted. Within weeks, and with polls showing more than two-thirds of the country supporting the protesters, the French government backtracked.The incident demonstrated the delicacy with which governments in democracies must implement policies to curb emissions, and the attention that must be paid to whose lives face the greatest disruption in the short term from efforts to scale down fossil fuels. It also sparked the then-nascent movement for a Green New Deal, a climate policy framework that prioritizes social safety nets and government-led industrial planning over pricing mechanisms that impose a cost on polluters.Sarah Hunt, CEO of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy, said in a series of tweets that Biden’s request of OPEC highlights how “we are not going to choose a habitable planet tomorrow over quality of life today.”“People want cheap energy more than they want clean energy. People don’t want cheap energy produced in their backyard,” she wrote.The “only answer,” she added, “is to innovate for better energy with fewer externalities.”Biden’s ask of OPEC unsurprisingly drew fire from conservatives, who argued the administration is destroying energy jobs at home and making the nation more reliant on fossil fuels produced overseas, and progressive climate advocates who questioned his commitment to rapidly confronting greenhouse gas emissions.Lorne Stockman, a senior research analyst at the climate advocacy group Oil Change International, said the move this week showed why the Biden administration should be taking every possible step to reduce demand for oil and increase production of zero-carbon alternatives.“Energy independence and energy dominance were myths spun by the American Petroleum Institute and its lackeys in Washington,” Stockman told HuffPost in an email. “The United States will only ever be free from manipulation of the international oil market when it ends fossil fuel subsidies, supports a just transition to clean energy, and ends the pernicious influence of the oil lobby.”"}, {"title": "Man Hand-Feeds Mako Shark, Still Has Hand", "text": "Keith Poe hand-feeds a mako shark like it’s a Yorkie nibbling on biscuits in a video he posted this week on YouTube.

(AP) — People in the Pacific Northwest braced for another major, multiday heat wave starting Wednesday, just over a month after record-shattering hot weather killed hundreds of the region’s most vulnerable when temperatures soared to 116 degrees Fahrenheit (47 Celsius).In a “worst-case scenario,” the temperature could reach as high as 111 F (44 C) in some parts of western Oregon by Friday before a weekend cooldown, the National Weather Service in Portland, Oregon, warned this week. It’s more likely temperatures will rise above 100 F (38 C) for three consecutive days, peaking around 105 F (40.5 C) on Thursday.Those are eye-popping numbers in a usually temperate region and would have come close to — or broken — all-time records if it weren’t for the late June heat wave, meteorologist Tyler Kranz said. Seattle will be cooler than Portland, with temperatures in the mid-90s, but it still has a chance to break records, and many people there, like in Oregon, don’t have air conditioning.“We’ll often hear people say, ‘Who cares if it’s 106 or 108? It gets this hot in Arizona all the time.’ Well, people in Arizona have air conditioning, and here in the Pacific Northwest, a lot of people don’t,” Kranz said. “You can’t really compare us to the desert Southwest.”Gov. Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency over the heat and activated an emergency operations center, citing the potential for disruptions to the power grid and transportation. City and county governments are opening cooling centers and misting stations in public buildings, extending the hours of public libraries and waiving bus fare for those headed to cooling centers. A statewide help line will direct callers to the nearest cooling shelter and offer tips on how to stay safe.The back-to-back heat waves, coupled with a summer that’s been exceptionally warm and dry overall, are pummeling a region where summer highs usually drift into the 70s or 80s. The heat comes amid a historic drought across the American West, both of which are tied to climate change.The June heat in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia killed hundreds of people and was a wake-up call as climate change makes weather more extreme in the historically temperate region. The heat wave was virtually impossible without human-caused climate change, a scientific analysis found.In Oregon, officials say at least 83 people died of heat-related illness, and the hot weather is being investigated as a possible cause in 33 more deaths. Washington state reported at least 91 heat deaths, and officials in British Columbia say hundreds of “sudden and unexpected deaths” were likely due to the soaring temperatures.The toll exposed huge blind spots in emergency planning in a region unaccustomed to dealing with such high temperatures, said Vivek Shandas, a professor of climate adaptation at Portland State University.Most of those who died in Oregon were older, homebound and socially isolated, and many were unable, or unwilling, to get to cooling centers.The call center designed to provide information about cooling centers was unstaffed during part of the peak heat, and hundreds of callers got stuck in a voicemail menu that didn’t include a prompt for heat-related help. Portland’s famed light-rail train also shut down to reduce strain on the power grid, eliminating a transportation option for low-income residents seeking relief.“We knew a week in advance. What would happen if we knew an earthquake was going to hit us a week in advance?” Shandas said. “That’s the kind of thinking we need to be aligned with. We know something disastrous is coming, and we need to get all hands on deck and focus on the most vulnerable.”Yet even younger residents struggled with the heat in June and dreaded this week’s sweltering temperatures.Katherine Morgan, 27, has no air conditioning in her third-floor apartment and can’t afford a window unit on the money she makes working at a bookstore and as a hostess at a brewery.She estimated that it hit 112 F (44 C) in her apartment in June. She tried to keep cool by taking cold showers, dousing her hair with water, eating Popsicles and sitting immobile in front of a fan for hours.Morgan, who doesn’t have a car, got ill from the heat after walking 20 minutes to work when it was 106 F (41 C). She took the following two days off rather than risk it again. The heat from the sidewalk, she said, felt like it was “cooking my ankles.”This week, she’ll have to walk to work Thursday, the day when temperatures could again soar just as high.“All my friends and I knew that climate change was real, but it’s getting really scary because it was gradually getting hot — and it suddenly got really hot, really fast,” Morgan said. “It’s eye-opening.”___Follow Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus."}, {"title": "Wildfires Ravage Greece, Turkey, Hot On The Heels Of U.N.

The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of hundreds in the past week across Greece, gobbling up pristine pine forests as well as homes and businesses and forcing hundreds to quickly evacuate by sea to save their lives.Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) and turned its prized pine forests into bone-dry tinderboxes.In a televised nationwide address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the destruction in Evia and elsewhere “blackens everyone’s hearts” and pledged compensation for all affected, as well as a huge reforestation and regeneration effort. He also apologized for “any weaknesses” shown in addressing the emergency, a nod to criticism from some residents and officials who said Greece’s firefighting efforts and equipment were woefully inadequate.“These last few days have been among the hardest for our country in decades,” Mitsotakis said. “We are dealing with a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.”With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia’s beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats.“We were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!” David Angelou, who had been in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving by ferry to the mainland.“You could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,” he said.Mitsotakis said Monday he “fully understands” the pain of those who lost homes or property, and the anger of those seeking airborne assistance “without knowing whether the firefighting aircraft were operating elsewhere or whether conditions made it impossible for them to fly.”But he urged Greeks to reflect “not only on what was lost but also on what was saved in such an unprecedented natural disaster.”Other big wildfires were still burning Monday in Greece’s southern Peloponnese region. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 40,000 hectares (nearly 100,000 acres) have been burned. Power cuts on Monday affected at least 17,000 households.The causes of the blazes are as yet undetermined, though several people have been arrested for alleged arson. Greece’s top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to criminal activity.More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to Greece’s call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.On Monday, Greece’s Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey — Greece’s historic regional rival — will be sending two firefighting planes because a top envoy said Turkey’s wildfires “are now under control.” The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters.Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and Aug. 8.Some residents ignored the orders to try to save their villages, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini firebreaks.“The villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,” said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria.“If they had evacuated their villages, as the civil protection told them to, everything would have been burnt down – perhaps even two days sooner,” he said. “Of course, they never saw any water-dropping aircraft. And of course now the conditions are wrong for them to fly, due to the smoke.”On Monday, the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages even as 600 firefighters struggled to tame the inferno, aided by emergency teams from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, 5 helicopters and 5 water-dropping planes.One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week while four more were in the hospital Monday, two in critical condition with extensive burns.Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica was coming close to houses on Monday.In Italy, authorities urged the public to be careful with fire amid a heat wave forecast for this week, when many Italians take summer vacations. Firefighters for weeks have been battling blazes in Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria, and two have died.“We have faced very difficult and dramatic days fighting fires, and the temperatures that are forecast require the utmost attention,’’ said Fabrizio Curcio, head of Italy’s Civil Protection agency. “We are asking the maximum collaboration and caution from citizens ... to avoid any behavior that can set off a fire and report immediately the smallest blaze.”In North Macedonia, dozens of wildfires followed the worst heat wave in decades. At least eight were still burning Monday, mostly in remote areas where only helicopters and planes could be deployed. Thousands of acres of forest have been destroyed and authorities have arrested five suspected arsonists.___Becatoros reported from Athens, Greece.

Hot, dry air sparked fast-growing wildfires in the western United States, as well as in Australia, Brazil and the Arctic. In California alone, fires scorched over 4 million acres of land.This wildfire season is on track to surpass the damage recorded in 2020. In Oregon, for example, there have been double the number of fires and 60 times more burned land compared to this time last year.Wildfires aren’t just dangerous for the people and wildlife living directly around the flames, but also for those nearby who are exposed to heavy smoke. And because smoke can travel long distances, even people thousands of miles away from the fires can feel their effects.Scientists are actively learning about the harms linked to wildfire smoke, but early findings suggest that wildfire smoke can have a seriously detrimental effect on our short and long-term health.Wildfire smoke contains a mixture of gases, liquids and solid particles. What concerns scientists the most about wildfire smoke is the fine particulate matter (called PM 2.5), or small pieces of liquid and gas that can stay suspended in the air.The smallest particles are the ones that can get deepest into the lungs and cause annoying symptoms — like a cough or shortness of breath — in the short term and more concerning health problems down the road, explained Colleen Reid, an environmental epidemiologist and health geographer with the University of Colorado Boulder.According to Reid, no level of PM 2.5 is considered safe — but at higher levels, the health effects are clearly worse.These tiny particles can get deep into our lungs and enter the bloodstream, at which point they can travel to other organs and cause widespread inflammation, Reid explained. One report found that teens living near wildfires have higher levels of inflammatory markers in their blood. Wildfire smoke can cause sore throats, a cough, watery eyes, congestion, headaches and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Smoke particles can also reach the brain and trigger cognitive issues.According to Rosana Aguilera Becker, an environmental health scientist with the University of California, San Diego, people who have asthma, respiratory illnesses or COPD are most at risk and have higher rates of hospital admissions due to smoke during wildfires. In areas close to wildfires, researchers have found a spike in inhaler refills among people who have asthma.Increases in visits to the emergency room for cardiovascular events and heart attacks have also been recorded in communities experiencing wildfires.The effects don’t go away once the smoke clears. A study from Montana found that seasons with record-high smoke were followed by more severe flu seasons, adding to the growing body of evidence that wildfire smoke can make people more susceptible to viruses and infections.The long-term health consequences linked to wildfire smoke exposure are understudied, largely because this hasn’t been a big issue until recently. In the past, there would be a wildfire, smoke would shoot into the sky for a short period of time, then the clogged air would clear out. It wasn’t until the past few fire seasons that the air quality has been really bad over really large geographic areas for really long periods of time, Reid said.But there are some clues. Wildfire smoke is thought to be a risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. And through her research, Reid has found that when pregnant people are exposed to wildfire smoke, there’s a greater risk of the baby being born early or at low birth weight.A study conducted on monkeys found that primates exposed to wildfires as infants had worse pulmonary functioning and immune functioning later on in life. This brings up the question of “what happens to children when they’re exposed to wildfire smoke when they’re still developing,” Becker said.Evidence looking at the long-term health effects of other types of air pollution suggests that harmful air can impact our respiratory health, cardiovascular health and neurological health. One study found that kids who grew up in areas with polluted air, like Los Angeles, go on to experience worse lung function as adults.“We could assume, based on what we know, that there are similar things with wildfire smoke,” Reid said, noting that we really need more research on wildfire smoke specifically.Scientists know the most about smoke exposure in communities that are close to wildfires. But what happens when that air travels thousands of miles, as it did this summer when the jet stream brought Oregon’s wildfire smoke to the East Coast? According to Reid, there can definitely be health consequences in these places, too.In the past, air pollution that traveled long distances was minuscule, but the fires in Oregon and Canada showed us that wildfire smoke can travel far and at really high concentrations. This is an area scientists will need to look into in the coming years. There may be differences in how fresh smoke and older smoke affects our health — but, again, no level of PM 2.5 is safe.Our behaviors also play a role. When a fire erupts in the West, people are aware of the fire and know to stay in. You can smell it and you can see plumes of smoke spilling into the air. On the East Coast, where there are no plumes or traces of a campfire scent, some people may not take the necessary steps to protect themselves from inhaling bad air, Reid said.You can gauge the quality of the air around you by checking your local air quality index (AQI). Reid recommends the app Smoke Sense, which provides an air quality map and recommendations for what you should or shouldn’t do. Air NOW is another tool that sends local alerts about AQIs.If PM 2.5 levels are high, the best thing to do is stay inside and limit your outdoor activities, Becker said. It’s OK for most people to exercise at lower PM 2.5 levels, as the benefits of exercise are thought to outweigh the risks.If you can afford an air purifier — they can be pricey! — get one with a HEPA filter. Keep your doors and windows closed. Older homes and rental properties tend to be leakier and allow more air pollution in. You can also purchase a MERV-13 filter and put it in a box fan or your AC unit. Make sure you’re regularly cleaning your car filters as they can collect a lot of particles over time. (You can find a list of filtering products certified by the Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America here.)If you do venture outside when the PM 2.5 levels are high, bring a mask. N95 masks are the gold standard because they filter all of the air that you breathe in. Though surgical masks are less effective, they’re ultimately better than having no barrier between you and the harmful particles in wildfire smoke."}, {"title": "Harrowing New UN Report Finds Humans Are The ‘Unequivocal’ Cause Of Climate Change", "text": "A new United Nations report reaffirms what world governments have known and failed to deal with for decades: that climate change is our fault, is already causing devastation around the globe and will continue to get worse.How much worse is entirely up to us.The assessment from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an up-to-date scientific understanding of planetary warming, as well as its current and future impacts. The international consortium of researchers left no room for debate over the cause of the global crisis.“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” reads a summary for policymakers. “Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.”U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called the findings “a code red for humanity.”“The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk,” he said in a statement.The lengthy document — authored by 234 scientists from 66 countries and which cites more than 14,000 scientific papers — is the first major update since 2013, when the world’s leading climate science body determined that humans were the “dominant cause” of global warming.The findings may come as little surprise to anyone closely following the science explaining visible shifts in weather patterns over the past two decades as seemingly biblical catastrophes have become increasingly deadly and commonplace around the world.But the IPCC’s review illustrates the mountain of evidence showing that, without a herculean effort to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, the world is headed toward even greater calamity. Past and future emissions have already locked in changes that will prove “irreversible” over centuries to millennia, from rising sea levels and ocean acidification to melting ice sheets, it states.IPCC authors also clearly lay out the differences between each degree of future temperature rise, stressing that every bit of warming avoided will go a long way toward limiting the frequency and severity of extreme heat, drought and weather events.“We know that there is no going back from some changes in the climate system — however, some of these changes could be slowed and others could be stopped by limiting warming,” Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and the senior adviser for climate at NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, said during a call with reporters.In the United States, President Joe Biden is advancing a number of policies to confront a threat that his predecessor, President Donald Trump, not only ignored but dismissed as a hoax. Ballooning emissions and decades of inaction by wealthy nations and polluting industries have rung in an era of extremes. The deadly heat wave that gripped the Pacific Northwest and Canada last month, for example, would have been ”virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, a recent study concluded.The crisis is currently affecting weather in “every region across the globe,” from grueling heat waves and historic drought to more intense tropical cyclones and precipitation events, the IPCC said, a reality underscored by the deadly wildfires currently torching broad swaths of Turkey, Greece and the rest of southern Europe.“These events are already causing great suffering and making our society less wealthy,” Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, said in an email. “But it will be a MUCH BIGGER future problem. The impacts we’re seeing today are occurring with only 1°C (1.8°F) of warming. By the end of the century, when many of the people alive today will still be alive, we could experience 3°C (5.4°F) of warming, which will be accompanied by impacts so severe that we’ll refer to Hurricane Harvey, the [Pacific Northwest] heatwave, and the California fires as ‘the good ‘ol days.’”Human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, has already driven the average global temperature approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and concentrations of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere are the highest they’ve been at any point in at least 2 million years. The IPCC and the scientific community at large have warned that limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius ― the goal of the landmark Paris climate agreement ― is crucial to staving off potentially catastrophic climate impacts.But that target may already be out of reach.The IPCC considered five future emissions scenarios. Under all of them, global temperatures will continue to rise through at least 2050. “Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades,” the summary states.Alex Ruane, a NASA scientist and a lead author of the report’s 12th chapter on regional impacts, told HuffPost in an interview Monday that one of the assessment’s key takeaways is that the world is facing a multifaceted problem, with multiple climate impacts often affecting whole regions and economic sectors.“The changes that are being seen are not easy to separate and deal with one at a time. It really gets to interactive changes,” he said.“It’s certainly a cautionary tale. Higher emissions lead to more challenges, and they have to be faced through some combination of mitigation or adaptation or risk management.”Melting permafrost in the Arctic in particular could hasten warming as carbon from dead plants and animals, built up and frozen over thousands of years, thaws and decomposes, releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere. The report warned that greenhouse gases from permafrost could generate 14 to 175 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per 1 degree Celsius of global warming ― a potentially dramatic increase considering humans alone produced about 40 billion metric tons of CO2 in 2019 alone.Scientific models, the report said, “project that emissions would continuously increase with warming, and that this trend could last for hundreds of years.”This means just cutting emissions won’t be enough to balance the carbon books and avert runaway warming. Since 1958, the atmosphere has only held onto about half the carbon humans have spewed as vegetation on land and the ocean has absorbed huge portions of the pollution from fossil fuels and deforestation. Those carbon “sinks” have grown in proportion to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Between 2010 and 2019, carbon sinks on land have taken up 31% of pollution while the oceans sucked up 23%, the report found.But if humans fail to keep warming in check, the forests and peat bogs on land and algae in the ocean that sucks up carbon will suffer and prove far less effective at absorbing CO2.“Under future high-warming scenarios, it is expected that the global ocean and land sinks will stop growing in the second half of the century as climate change increasingly affects them,” the report said. “Thus, both the total amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere and the responses of the natural CO2 sinks will determine what efforts are required to limit global warming to a certain level.”In what appears to be a sign of this phenomenon already taking place, a study published last month in the journal Nature found that the Amazon rainforest, widely seen as one of the world’s most important carbon sinks, had already begun emitting more CO2 than it absorbs as historic levels of deforestation and fire devour the South American jungle.Humans are developing ways to suck CO2 out of the sky. The concepts range in technological complexity. For example, applying crushed rock dust to croplands could pull 2 billion metric tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually, a University of Sheffield study found last year. Machines that vacuum carbon from the atmosphere and chemically transform it into a substance that can be stored in underground caverns ― a technology known as direct air capture ― are also under development.But the IPCC warned that such “approaches capable of large-scale removal of CO2 are still in the state of research and development or unproven at the scales of deployment necessary to achieve a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels.”The reality is that we humans are playing with fire, and there is growing concern that we are fast-approaching climate “tipping points” beyond which changes become widespread and unstoppable.“The more we push the climate system from the state that it’s been in for the last several thousand years, the greater the odds that we cross thresholds that we can only poorly project,” Bob Kopp, a report author and climate scientist at Rutgers’ Institute of Earth, Ocean & Atmospheric Sciences, told reporters."}, {"title": "Colorado Hiker Captures Terrifying Moose Charge On Video", "text": "A Colorado hiker heading to a lake was thrilled to spot a gigantic moose munching on leaves, and decided to capture the moment on cellphone video.But the nature lover was suddenly in a race for survival when the thousand-pound-plus beast looked up and abruptly charged.“Thankfully no injuries occurred,” Colorado Parks and Wildlife noted in a tweet Sunday. “This person managed to get behind a tree — and the moose hit that.”The near-miss occurred in Clear Creek County, about 20 miles west of downtown Denver.The CPW tweet warned that the video is an “example of being too close to a bull moose and how quickly they can decide to charge.”Moose are the largest and “one of most dangerous and unpredictable” wild animals in Colorado, noted a CPW instructional video on “how not to get stomped.” More people are attacked in the state by moose each year than by any other species of wildlife — and encounters are ticking up.“They are now appearing in many of our busy mountain towns, rural neighborhoods, tourist destinations and ski areas,” said CPW Director Elissa Sleza. “While this creates exciting opportunities to view these fascinating animals, dangerous conflicts between moose and people have become increasingly common in recent years.”Colorado has some 2,500 moose, which are generally unafraid of humans. They’ll stand their ground if approached, then will often charge if they feel threatened. They are equipped with massive antlers and can run up to 35 mph.Humans should stay far back from any moose (at least 25 yards away), and be on the alert for any signs of pending aggression like laid-back ears, warn wildlife officials. Moose often attack dogs, who remind them of wolves, their No. 1 predator, and owners can sometimes get in the way.Check out more tips — and attacks — below:"}, {"title": "Fire-friendly Weather To Return To Northern California", "text": "Thick smoke that held down winds and temperatures began to clear Sunday from the scenic forestlands of Northern California as firefighters battling the largest single wildfire in state history braced for a return of fire-friendly weather.The winds weren’t expected to reach the ferocious speeds that helped the Dixie Fire explode in size last week. But they were nonetheless concerning for firefighters working in unprecedented conditions to protect thousands of threatened homes.“The live trees that are out there now have a lower fuel moisture than you would find when you go to a hardware store or a lumber yard and get that piece of lumber that’s kiln dried,” Mark Brunton, operations section chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said in an online briefing Sunday morning. “It’s that dry, so it doesn’t take much for any sort of embers, sparks or small flaming front to get that going.”Fueled by strong winds and bone-dry vegetation, the fire incinerated much of Greenville on Wednesday and Thursday, destroying 370 homes and structures and threatening nearly 14,000 buildings in the northern Sierra Nevada.The Dixie Fire, named for the road where it started nearly four weeks ago, grew overnight to an area of 725 square miles (1,875 square kilometers) Sunday morning and was just 21% contained, according to CalFire. It had scorched an area more than twice the size of New York City.With smoke clearing out on eastern portions of the fire, crews that had been directly attacking the front lines would be forced to retreat and build containment lines farther back, said Dan McKeague, a fire information officer from the U.S. Forest Service. On the plus side, better visibility should allow planes and helicopters to return to the firefight and make it safer for ground crews to maneuver.“As soon as that air clears, we can fly again,” McKeague said.Crews have constructed 465 miles (748 km) of line around the massive blaze, Deputy Incident Commander Chris Waters said. That’s about the distance from the central California city of Chico to Los Angeles. But officials are only confident that about 20% of the line is secure, he said.“Every bit of that line needs to be constructed, staffed, mopped up and actually put to bed before we can call this fire fully contained,” Waters said during Saturday evening’s incident briefing.Erratic winds were predicted again Sunday afternoon. But the weather was expected to settle a bit starting Monday.Damage reports are preliminary because assessment teams can’t get into many areas, officials said.The blaze became the largest single fire in California’s recorded history, surpassing last year’s Creek Fire in the Central Valley. It’s about half the size of the August Complex, a series of lightning-caused 2020 fires across seven counties that were fought together and that state officials consider California’s largest wildfire overall.The fire’s cause was under investigation. The Pacific Gas & Electric utility has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details by Aug. 16 about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started.Cooler temperatures and higher humidity slowed the spread of the fire, and temperatures topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) instead of the triple-digit highs recorded earlier in the week.But the blaze and its neighboring fires, within several hundred miles of each other, posed an ongoing threat.Gov. Gavin Newsom surveyed the damage in Greenville Saturday, writing on Twitter that “our hearts ache for this town.”“These are climate-induced wildfires and we have to acknowledge that we have the capacity in not just the state but in this country to solve this,” Newsom said on CNN.Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.Northwest of the Dixie Fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, hundreds of homes remained threatened by the McFarland and Monument fires, which continued growing. About a fifth of the McFarland Fire was contained and none of the Monument Fire.South of the Dixie Fire, firefighters prevented further growth of the River Fire, which broke out Wednesday near Colfax and destroyed 68 homes.Smoke from wildfires burning in the U.S. West continues to flow into parts of Colorado and Utah, where the air quality in many areas was rated as unhealthy. Denver’s air quality Sunday was relatively better than Saturday, but the smoke has made the air there and in Salt Lake City among the worst in the world.California’s fire season is on track to surpass last year’s season, which was the worst fire season in recent recorded state history.Since the start of the year, more than 6,000 blazes have destroyed more than 1,260 square miles (3,260 square kilometers) of land — more than triple the losses for the same period in 2020, according to state fire figures.California’s raging wildfires were among 107 large fires burning across 14 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.___Associated Press writer Daisy Nguyen contributed."}, {"title": "Fear Grips Californians As Wildfires Roar Through Communities", "text": "GREENVILLE, Calif.

With cruises largely being a no-go during the pandemic, overall marine traffic in the state’s Glacier Bay dropped by about 40%, the BBC reported in a comprehensive piece about the whales in southern Alaska.Humpback whales previously stuck close by each other and communicated in less complex ways, similar to people in a loud bar, National Park Service wildlife biologist Christine Gabriele told the BBC. But with fewer ships, whales spread out across greater distances and their whale songs became more varied. Mothers were observed giving their calves more freedom and even sometimes taking naps, she said.The first large cruise ship in 21 months ― a test voyage aimed at gauging how well COVID-19 precautions would work ― returned to Alaska last month, according to the Anchorage Daily News.Gabriele and other researchers spoke to NPR last summer about how the halt on cruises, along with international shipping slowing down, provided a unique opportunity to observe the impact of decreased sound on Glacier Bay’s whales.“Whales use sound in almost every aspect of their daily life,” she said.Scientists hoped that finding out more about how underwater sound affects whales would be helpful in crafting conservation policy.“More needs to be done,” Jason Gedamke of NOAA fisheries’ ocean acoustics program told NPR. “When you have animals that for millions of years have been able to communicate over vast distances in the ocean, and then once we introduce noise and have increased sound levels and they can’t communicate over those distances, clearly there’s going to be some impact there.”Whales are far from the only wild animals that saw at least temporary benefit from decreased human interference when COVID-19 struck. In the early months of the pandemic, a plunge in travel led to a significant drop in wild animals being hit by cars, according to research from the University of California, Davis.And when U.S. national parks were closed to visitors in 2020, wildlife thrived and animals were seen boldly ranging over areas they previously avoided due to human presence."}, {"title": "'A Biblical Catastrophe': Wildfires Rampage Through Greece", "text": "THRAKOMAKEDONES, Greece (AP) — Wildfires rampaged through Greek forests for yet another day Saturday, threatening homes and triggering more evacuations a day after hundreds of people were plucked off beaches by ferries in a dramatic overnight rescue.One volunteer firefighter has died and at least 20 people have been treated in hospitals. Dozens of fires were burning across the country Saturday, blazes that one official described as “a biblical catastrophe.”Scores of homes, businesses and farms have been burnt over the last week in fires that broke out during Greece’s most protracted and intense heat wave in three decades.One massive fire advanced up the slopes of Mount Parnitha, a national park north of Athens that features some of the last substantial forests near the Greek capital. The blaze sent choking smoke across Athens, where authorities set up a hotline for residents with breathing problems. Overnight and throughout the day, fire crews struggled to contain constant flare-ups.In apocalyptic scenes that went into the night, small ferries and other boats evacuated 1,400 people from a seaside village and beaches on Evia, an island of rugged, forested mountains popular with tourists and campers, after approaching flames cut off other means of escape.

Most were quickly tamed, but several rapidly burned out of control, consuming homes and causing untold ecological damage.A local official in the Mani region of the Peloponnese estimated the wildfire there had destroyed around 70% of her area.“It’s a biblical catastrophe. We’re talking about three-quarters of the municipality,” East Mani Deputy Mayor Drakoulakou told state broadcaster ERT, pleading for more water-dropping aircraft.Other local officials and residents in southern Greece, near Athens and on Evia, phoned in to television programs, appealing live on air for more firefighting help.Civil Protection chief Nikos Hardalias said firefighters were battling 55 active fires by Saturday afternoon.“We’re continuing to fight a very big battle. All night our forces worked hard,” Hardalias said, adding that he expected the fire north of Athens to be contained, barring any unexpected developments, within the day.More than 850 firefighters, 40 ground teams, three aircraft, six helicopters and 215 vehicles were working to extinguish the flames north of Athens, Hardalias said, with Greek forces reinforced by French, Cypriot and Israeli firefighters.In Evia, where 39 villages had been evacuated, six aircraft, four helicopters, 475 firefighters and 35 ground teams were operating, including Romanian and Ukrainian firefighters. The army sent 84 special forces personnel, while the navy was providing a torpedo boat, two landing craft and 15 smaller boats to assist in sea evacuations if necessary, Hardalias said.Greece requested help through the European Union’s emergency support system. Firefighters and aircraft were sent from France, Ukraine, Cyprus, Croatia, Sweden, Israel, Romania and Switzerland. Egypt said Saturday it was sending two helicopters, while 36 Czech firefighters with 15 vehicles left for Greece, and Greek authorities said Spain was also sending a plane.Fires described as the worst in decades have also swept through stretches of neighboring Turkey’s southern coast for the past 10 days, killing eight people. The top Turkish forestry official said 217 fires had been brought under control since July 28 in over half of the country’s provinces, but firefighters still worked Saturday to tame six fires in two Turkish provinces.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited the fire department’s headquarters in Athens Saturday and expressed his “deep sadness for what has happened.”Securing aid for everyone affected by the wildfires would be “my first political priority,” he said, promising that all burnt areas would be declared reforestation zones.“When this nightmarish summer has passed, we will turn all our attention to repairing the damage as fast as possible, and in restoring our natural environment again,” Mitsotakis said.Greece has been baked by its most protracted heat wave in 30 years, with temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Temperatures eased Friday but the winds picked up, further exacerbating the situation.Evacuation orders for villages and neighborhoods have been constant, sent by push alerts to mobile phones in affected areas, while some police and firefighters have gone door-to-door urging people to leave.The causes of the fires are under investigation. Hardalias said three people were arrested Friday — in the greater Athens area, central and southern Greece — on suspicion of starting blazes, in two cases intentionally. Police said the suspect detained north of Athens had allegedly lit fires at three separate spots in the area ravaged by the large blaze, which first broke out Tuesday.Greek and European officials also have blamed climate change for the large number of fires burning through southern Europe, from southern Italy to the Balkans, Greece and Turkey.In Turkey’s seaside province of Mugla, a popular region for tourists, some fires appeared to be under control Saturday and cooling efforts were ongoing. The forestry minister said blazes continued in the Milas area. Environmental groups urged authorities to protect the forests of Sandras Mountain from nearby fires.Further north, at least six neighborhoods were evacuated due to a wildfire in western Aydin province, where shifty winds were making containment efforts difficult, Turkish media reported.Municipal officials in Antalya, on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, said a wildfire was still burning around the Eynif plain, where wild horses live.Massive fires also have been burning across Siberia in northern Russia for weeks, forcing the evacuation Saturday of a dozen villages. In all, wildfires have burned nearly 15 million acres this year in Russia.In the United States, hot, bone-dry, gusty weather has also fueled devastating wildfires in California.Becatoros reported from Argostoli, Greece.

Scientists attribute the decade-long drought to human-caused climate change.A study published in June predicted that droughts and other extreme weather events will become even worse throughout South America if greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked.“South America and Brazil in particular are already showing signs of climate change, including a rise in surface temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, melting of glaciers in the Andes, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events,” Lincoln Muniz Alves, a researcher at Brazil’s National Space Research Institute, said in a news release. “These variations in the characteristics of the climate are forerunners of what will happen in the decades ahead if the unprecedented rise in greenhouse gas emissions continues.”A historic drought is simultaneously slamming the western U.S., which is seeing a dwindling water supply and escalating threat of wildfires worsened by exceptionally hot and dry conditions."}, {"title": "Beloved Central Park Owl Barry Killed In Crash", "text": "A year-old barred owl in Manhattan’s Central Park, a favorite of park strollers and birders, has died after apparently crashing into a park vehicle during a hunt for food.The owl, named Barry by her fans, appeared to enjoy all the attention she got and almost seemed to hold poses for people snapping her photo.“It is with a heavy heart we share that a barred owl, a beloved Central Park resident, passed away early this morning,” said a statement from the Central Park Conservancy. “Flying low, likely in search of a meal, the barred owl made contact with a Conservancy maintenance vehicle at approximately 2:30 am.” Friday morning.Barry’s “presence in Central Park brought so much joy, reminding all of us that the Park is a vital greenspace for all New Yorkers, including the wildlife that call it home.”Tributes to Barry poured in on Twitter.

That’s 2.8 times larger than the goal set by a federal task force to reduce the five-year average to 1,900 square miles (4,921 square kilometers) or smaller by 2035.Because year-to-year measurements can vary widely — this year’s zone is about three times the size of 2020’s — NOAA says a multiyear average “captures the true dynamic nature of the zone.”This summer’s measurement was larger than the average-sized area that the agency predicted in June based on Mississippi River nitrogen and phosphorous runoff data.River discharge that drained into the Gulf of Mexico was above normal for the three weeks before the weeklong survey started on July 25. It was conducted by scientists from Louisiana State University and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.“The distribution of the low dissolved oxygen was unusual this summer,” Nancy Rabalais, the lead investigator, said. “The low oxygen conditions were very close to shore with many observations showing an almost complete lack of oxygen.”Human activities in urban and agricultural areas throughout the Mississippi River watershed primarily cause the annual “dead zone.” Excess nutrients flow into the Gulf of Mexico and stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which die and decompose. The algae deplete oxygen as they sink to the bottom.NOAA highlighted efforts to reduce fertilizer runoff and other pollution from contributing to the hypoxic area. Radhika Fox, the Environmental Protection Agency’s assistant administrator for water, said climate change also needs to be considered to make progress.“This year, we have seen again and again the profound effect that climate change has on our communities — from historic drought in the west to flooding events,” Fox said. “Climate is directly linked to water, including the flow of nutrient pollution into the Gulf of Mexico.”"}, {"title": "Dixie Fire Explodes To Third-Largest In California History", "text": "GREENVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A wildfire raging in Northern California exploded in size overnight, becoming the third-largest wildfire in state history amid high temperatures and strong winds. Better weather conditions were expected to aid the firefight on Friday.The Dixie Fire grew by 110 square miles (285 square kilometers) between Thursday night and Friday morning, making the blaze the largest wildfire currently raging in the nation.“This is going to be a long firefight,” said Capt. Mitch Matlow, spokesperson of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The fire was 35% contained Friday morning but was largely expanding within the perimeter firefighters previously established. It now spans an area of 676 square miles (1,751 square kilometers.On Wednesday, the fire tore through the little California mountain town of Greenville, which resident Eva Gorman said was a place of community and strong character, where neighbors volunteered to move furniture, colorful baskets of flowers brightened Main Street, and writers, musicians, mechanics and chicken farmers mingled.Now, it’s ashes.As hot, bone-dry, gusty weather hit California, the fire raged through the Gold Rush-era Sierra Nevada community of about 1,000, incinerating much of the downtown that included wooden buildings more than a century old.The winds were expected to calm and change direction heading into the weekend but that good news came too late for Gorman.“It’s just completely devastating. We’ve lost our home, my business, our whole downtown area is gone,” said Gorman, who heeded evacuation warnings and left town with her husband a week and-a-half ago as the Dixie Fire approached.She managed to grab some photos off the wall, her favorite jewelry and important documents but couldn’t help but think of the family treasures left behind.“My grandmother’s dining room chairs, my great-aunt’s bed from Italy. There is a photo I keep visualizing in my mind of my son when he was 2. He’s 37 now,” she said. “At first you think, ‘It’s OK, I have the negatives.’ And then you realize, ‘Oh. No. I don’t.’”Officials had not yet assessed the number of destroyed buildings, but Plumas County Sheriff Todd Johns estimated on Thursday that “well over” 100 homes had burned in and near the town.“My heart is crushed by what has occurred there,” said Johns, a lifelong Greenville resident.About a two-hour drive south, officials said some 100 homes and other buildings burned in the fast-moving River Fire that broke out Wednesday near Colfax, a town of about 2,000. There was no containment and about 6,000 people were ordered to evacuate in Placer and Nevada counties, state fire officials said.The three-week-old Dixie Fire was one of 100 active, large fires burning in 14 states, most in the West where historic drought has left lands parched and ripe for ignition.The Dixie Fire had consumed about 432,813 acres, according to an estimate released Friday morning. That’s 676 square miles (1,751 square kilometers) — moving the blaze from the state’s sixth-largest wildfire ever to its third-largest overnight.The fire’s cause was under investigation, but Pacific Gas & Electric has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of the utility’s power lines. No injuries or deaths have been reported.The blaze exploded on Wednesday and Thursday through timber, grass and brush so dry that one fire official described it as “basically near combustion.” Dozens of homes had already burned before the flames made new runs.No deaths or injuries were reported but the fire continued to threaten more than 10,000 homes.On Thursday, the weather and towering smoke clouds produced by the fire’s intense, erratic winds kept firefighters struggling to put firefighters at shifting hot spots.“It’s wreaking havoc. The winds are kind of changing direction on us every few hours,” said Capt. Sergio Arellano, a fire spokesman.“We’re seeing truly frightening fire behavior,” said Chris Carlton, supervisor for Plumas National Forest. “We really are in uncharted territory.”Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires  harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.The blaze hit Greenville from two angles and firefighters already were in the town trying to save it but first they had to risk their lives to save people who had refused to evacuate by loading people into cars to get them out, fire officials said.“We have firefighters that are getting guns pulled out on them, because people don’t want to evacuate,” said Jake Cagle, an incident management operations section chief.The flames also reached the town of Chester, northwest of Greenville, but crews managed to protect homes and businesses there, with only minor damage to one or two structures, officials said.The fire was not far from the town of Paradise, which was largely destroyed in a 2018 wildfire sparked by PG&E equipment that killed 85 people, making it the nation’s deadliest in at least a century.California’s blazes are not the only wildfires scorching vast areas in the world. Thousands of people fled wildfires burning out of control in Greece and Turkey on Friday, including a major blaze just north of the Greek capital of Athens that left one person dead, as a protracted heat wave turned forests into tinderboxes and flames threatened populated areas, electricity installations and historic sites.___Weber reported from Los Angeles.

The wolves were killed during breeding season (wolves mate for life) by hunters allowed to use dogs, traps and snowmobiles.State Department of Natural Resources officials believe culling an additional 130 wolves is a “conservative” approach. The department’s board will consider the recommendation next week.The Center for Biological Diversity called the February hunt a “reckless slaughter.”Adrian Wydeven, a retired state wolf biologist and a member of the conservation group Wisconsin’s Green Fire, said the 130 number is “too high, given the unknowns” of the impact from February’s hunt. Neither Michigan nor Minnesota, which also have wolf populations, will allow hunts this year.University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers warned in a new study that Wisconsin’s plans for another hunt “raise questions about sustainability.”A third of the state’s wolves were killed during February’s hunt and in poaching that followed, according to the researchers. That leaves the Wisconsin’s total wolf population at 695 to 751.The population decline appears to contradict the state Department of Natural Resources’ “explicit objectives of no change in the wolf population,” the study noted.The state’s stated goal is maintaining a stable population of wolves, a top predator that helps sustain ecosystem health, study co-author and Madison environmental studies professor Adrian Treves told The National Geographic.Treves called plans for a November hunt unwise, particularly since officials have no clear understanding of the impact of the February killings. Hunters often seek out the largest animals, for example, which are frequently pack leaders whose loss could leave entire groups to starve to death. The killing of fertile females would further reduce the population.In addition, the study warned that February’s killing of more wolves than allowed “raises serious questions about the adequacy of regulatory mechanisms to prevent wolves becoming endangered again.”“We caution that science may play little role in wolf politics where the animal has become a symbol for political rhetoric and a symbol of cultural divisions,” the study added."}, {"title": "5 Jaw-Dropping Photos Showing Climate Change Effects And The Stories Behind Them", "text": "Extreme heatwaves and raging wildfires have been overtaking cities around the world this week, bringing the effects of climate change to the doorsteps of thousands of people.

A 2019 United Nations report concluded that while the current is “very likely” to weaken this century, a total breakdown was unlikely.But the new study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Climate Change, indicates the situation could be far direr than previously thought. The current changes may be tied to “an almost complete loss of stability of the AMOC over the course of the last century,” the analysis states.“The findings support the assessment that the AMOC decline is not just a fluctuation or a linear response to increasing temperatures but likely means the approaching of a critical threshold beyond which the circulation system could collapse,” Niklas Boers, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and the study’s author, said in a statement.A crippled Atlantic current system could trigger catastrophic, potentially irreversible changes, from rising seas in North America to major disruptions to seasonal monsoon rains in Asia and South America.“The mere possibility that the AMOC tipping point is close should be motivation enough for us to take countermeasures,” Levke Caesar, a climate physicist at Ireland’s Maynooth University, told The Washington Post. “The consequences of a collapse would likely be far-reaching.”But Andreas Schmittner, a climate scientist at Oregon State University, is skeptical of the study’s conclusion.“The method used in the paper has been developed and tested in very simple models of dynamical systems, but then it is applied to observations of sea surface temperatures and salinities,” he told HuffPost in an email. “I think their method is brand new and needs to be tested by different investigators and explored more in complex climate models to see if it works with the data they used. I think it is premature to conclude that the AMOC is on the brink of collapse.”The study comes ahead of a major report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, the leading consortium of researchers studying human-caused temperature rise. The assessment, due out Aug. 9 and authored by more than 200 scientists, will provide an up-to-date understanding of the crisis and its current and future effects around the globe.There’s no way to pinpoint the level of greenhouse gas emissions that would lock in a total collapse of the AMOC, Boers told The Guardian. “The only thing to do,” he said, “is keep emissions as low as possible. The likelihood of this extremely high-impact event happening increases with every gram of CO2 that we put into the atmosphere.”"}, {"title": "Republicans Resurrect Bill To Give States The Keys To Federal Lands", "text": "A group of Republican senators has reintroduced legislation to strip the federal government of its authority over leasing, permitting and regulating energy development on federally controlled acres.The so-called Federal Land Freedom Act would “give states the right to develop all of the energy resources on the federal lands located within the state’s borders,” reads a press release from co-sponsor Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). It would also exempt energy activity from requirements of landmark environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as reverse the flow of royalties, with companies paying those fees directly to states instead of the federal government.In a statement accompanying the release, Cramer said the Biden administration has “worked to hamstring American energy production” and that the bill “would give North Dakota greater control over how to best utilize Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands within our borders.”The change would not impact tribal, national park, national refuge or wilderness-designated lands.It is a dream bill for America’s oil and gas sector, as states are often much more friendly to extraction than the federal government. In fact, in his press release, Cramer noted just two organizations that support the bill: the North Dakota Petroleum Council and the Lignite Energy Council, a coal industry group.The bill’s primary sponsor is Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a longtime climate change denier who famously brought a snowball to the Senate floor in 2015 in a sad attempt to demonstrate that global warming was a hoax.

In a post to Twitter, Greg Zimmerman, director at Project 30x30, called it “a retread of the insanely unpopular attempts by [Republican] lawmakers during the Obama years to seize American-owned public lands, give them to states, and swing the doors open to extraction.”Its resurrection comes as the Biden administration works to finalize a sweeping review of the federal oil and gas leasing program.

These past storms are included in the total number of storms forecast for the season.“After a record-setting start, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season does not show any signs of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,” said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator.NOAA’s latest forecast is a slight jump from the previous forecast it made in late May, when it predicted 13 to 20 named storms and six to 10 hurricanes. The number of major hurricanes predicted has not changed.“Now is the time to be vigilant about your preparedness plans and potential actions,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said at a news conference. “As we have seen in recent years, threats from hurricanes are not limited to damaging winds but also dangerous storm surge and torrential rain and wind flooding.”Overall, the likelihood of an above-normal 2021 season is now 65% ― up from a 60% projection in May. If the prediction is accurate, 2021 would be the sixth consecutive year to feature above-average storm activity in the Atlantic.Fortunately, due to sea surface temperatures being closer to average across the Atlantic region where storms typically develop, this year is not expected to be as active as last year, said Rosencrans.NOAA last month also issued a La Niña Watch, with a 55% chance of it emerging during the September-November period and lasting through winter.This climate pattern tends to lead to drought in the southern U.S. and heavy rains and flooding in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. While it tends to suppress hurricane activity along the Pacific, it can lead to more and stronger Atlantic storms, particularly in the latter half of the year, according to NOAA.The chance of La Niña was factored into NOAA’s hurricane outlook for this year, said Rosencrans.NOAA’s upgraded forecast comes as the National Hurricane Center monitors two disturbances brewing in the Atlantic. One of the disturbances is said to have the potential to turn into a tropical depression by early next week."}, {"title": "Fire Engulfs Northern California Town That Dates Back To The Gold Rush Era", "text": "GREENVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A wind-driven wildfire tore through a Northern California mountain town, leaving much of the downtown in ashes and crews braced for another explosive run of flames in the midst of dangerous weather.The Dixie Fire, swollen by bone-dry vegetation and 40-mph gusts, raged through the northern Sierra Nevada town of Greenville Wednesday evening. Fire officials confirmed that some buildings were destroyed but had no details.However, a photographer on assignment for The Associated Press described seeing a gas station, hotel and bar burned to the ground.The town, which dates to California’s Gold Rush era, has some buildings more than a century old.As the fire’s north and eastern sides exploded, the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office issued a Facebook posting warning the town’s approximately 800 residents: “You are in imminent danger and you MUST leave now!”The three-week-old blaze was the state’s largest wildfire and had blackened well over 435 square miles and had already burned dozens of homes before making its new run.Early in the week, some 5,000 firefighters had made progress on the blaze, saving some threatened homes, bulldozing pockets of unburned vegetation and managing to surround a third of the perimeter.“We did everything we could,” fire spokesman Mitch Matlow said. “Sometimes it’s just not enough.”More fire engines and bulldozers were being ordered to bolster the fight, he said. On Wednesday, the fire grew by thousands of acres and an additional 4,000 people were ordered to evacuate, bringing nearly 26,500 people in several counties under evacuation orders, he said.Red flag weather conditions of high heat, low humidity and gusty afternoon and evening winds erupted Wednesday and were expected to be a continued threat through Thursday evening.The trees, grass and brush were so dry that “if an ember lands, you’re virtually guaranteed to start a new fire,” Matlow said.“The fire behavior analyst said every single fire hazard is maxed out,” he added.The blaze was also running parallel to a canyon area that served as a chimney, so hot that it created enormous pyrocumulus columns of smoke that bring chaotic winds, making it “critically erratic” and hard to predict the direction of growth, he added.Dawn Garofalo watched the soaring cloud grow from the west side of Lake Almanor, where she fled with a dog and two horses, from a friend’s property near Greenville.“There’s only one way in and one way out,” she said. “I didn’t want to be stuck up there if the fire came through.”From her campsite on the lake bed, she watched the fire glowing on the horizon before dawn.About 150 miles to the west, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The fire was only 5% contained after burning through nearly 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) of drought-stricken vegetation.Similar risky weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week.Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in America’s West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 U.S. states, the National Interagency Fire Center said."}, {"title": "Emperor Penguin Colonies Face Extinction Due To Climate Change, U.S. Officials Say", "text": "U.S. officials are seeking to list emperor penguins as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act due to climate change, with the request coming as an independent study warns that nearly all of the seabird’s colonies could be nearly wiped out by 2100.“Climate change, a priority challenge for this Administration, impacts a variety of species throughout the world,” Martha Williams, principal deputy director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, said in a statement. “The decisions made by policymakers today and during the next few decades will determine the fate of the emperor penguin.”Melting sea ice is primarily jeopardizing the emperor penguin’s ability to form breeding colonies, forage for food and avoid predators due to their habitat’s destruction along Antarctica’s coastline, officials said.“As carbon dioxide emissions rise, the Earth’s temperature will continue to increase, causing large patches of sea ice to melt. The melting ice could affect a variety of species, including emperor penguins, who rely on sea ice for survival,” the FWS said in release.The federal agency estimates that though the penguins’ populations are currently robust, their global size will likely decrease by 26 to 47% by 2050. That’s under low and high carbon emissions scenarios, respectively.This puts them “in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future in a significant portion of its range,” the FWS said.Another study published Tuesday in the journal Global Change Biology painted a more dire picture, however, with it concluding that around 70% of emperor penguin colonies will be endangered by 2050. By 2100, 98% could be on the brink of extinction, the study found.The study determined that rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, specifically limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit under the international Paris Agreement, would be “by far the most important action for preventing catastrophic species losses.” Protecting natural habitat, increasing habitat connectivity and reducing non-climate stressors would also increase the species’ resilience to climate stress.This study’s findings were considered by the FWS with its proposal on Tuesday, The New York Times reported.The U.S. officially left the Paris Agreement in late 2020 under the leadership of then President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden signed an executive order to rejoin it immediately after taking office in January. By joining the pact, nations agree to limit their greenhouse gas emissions to help prevent global warming.The FWS said that not all emperor penguin colonies are expected to be affected equally by climate change, with populations in the Ross and Weddell Seas likely to remain stable for the species during its projected timeline. Other colonies ― specifically the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea sectors ― are meanwhile projected to decline by over 90% due to melting sea.Though this estimated decline is concerning, the FWS said “there is still time to prevent the species from becoming endangered throughout a significant portion of its range.”Listing emperor penguins under the Endangered Species Act would make it unlawful to harass, harm, or capture the animal without a permit. It would also be illegal to significantly modify or degrade its habitat in ways that kill or injure the animal, including by impairing its essential behavior patterns, such as breeding, feeding or sheltering.Though the species is not found within the U.S., this new threatened status could have an impact on fishing regulations. Environmentalists hope it will impact fossil fuel use as well, as the Times reported.“The hope is that, with these added protections, approvals of U.S. fossil fuel projects will have to weigh harms to penguins and their Antarctic habitat, ultimately reducing heat-trapping pollution worldwide,” Sarah Uhlemann, international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told the Times.A 60-day public comment period now follows the FWS’s recommendation."}, {"title": "U.S. Expands Wild Horse Roundups Amid Severe Western Drought", "text": "RENO, Nev. (AP) — U.S. land managers have begun efforts to capture about 50% more wild horses than originally planned this year because of severe drought across the U.S. West — about 6,000 additional animals primarily in Nevada, Oregon and Colorado.The Bureau of Land Management said the emergency roundups that began Sunday in Oregon and Monday in Nevada concentrate on places where “chronic overpopulation” of the herds “already has stretched the available food and water to its limits.”“As one of the agencies charged with the responsibility to protect and manage America’s wild horses and burros, the BLM is prepared to take emergency action where we can in order to save the lives of these cherished animals,” said Nada Wolff Culver, the bureau’s deputy director for policy and programs.The agency is committed to “continuing our efforts to reduce overpopulation across the West and achieve healthy, sustainable herd sizes that are more capable of withstanding severe conditions, including prolonged drought, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change,” she said in announcing the effort Monday.Horse advocates say the emergency roundups that will continue into September are being driven by pressure from ranchers who don’t want the mustangs competing with their livestock for limited forage and water.One advocate said she’s especially disappointed the Biden administration is continuing the policies of former President Donald Trump and previous administrations that prioritized removal of horses that are federally protected without reining in the number of cattle and sheep grazing on the same land.“Profit-driven interests ravage the landscape, and we blame the horse,” said Laura Leigh, president of the nonprofit group Wild Horse Education.“Absolutely nothing has changed under the Biden administration except we are being spoon-fed a dose of greenwash that they ‘care’ about the environment and wild things,” she said.The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said ranchers already have made voluntary changes to reduce and rotate grazing on federal lands during a drought “more pervasive and dramatic than we have seen in years,” said Kaitlynn Glover, the association’s executive director of resources.“These removals are critical for the horses as well as the health of the rangelands,” she said in an email to The Associated Press. “Even in times where resources are plentiful, these overpopulated herds cause serious damage to the landscape.”The bureau already has gathered 1,200 animals this year and originally intended to round up about 12,000. The new effort would push the total to about 18,000 across 10 Western states from Montana to California.The bureau says the estimated 86,000 free-roaming mustangs and burros on federal lands is three times what the ecosystem can sustain, something that animal advocates dispute.About 1,400 that are rounded up would be returned to the range after they receive contraceptive drugs. But the total rounded up would be more than double the 9,181 gathered last year.The previous peak over the past decade was 9,749 in 2018. Fewer than 4,100 were gathered annually from 2013 through 2017.Culver noted that the land agency announced last week that it was taking additional steps to ensure that captured horses made available for public adoption do not end up in the hands of secondhand buyers who ship them to slaughterhouses.That move drew mixed reactions from horse advocates, who welcomed efforts to tighten regulations but said the reforms don’t go far enough and that horses will still end up being slaughtered as long as the government offers $1,000 cash incentives to adopt the animals.Neda DeMayo, president of Return to Freedom Wild Horse Conservation, said the crisis on the range is the result of the Bureau of Land Management’s “failure to implement solutions that have been available for over 20 years,” including accelerated use of fertility control programs.U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat, agreed.“This situation further illustrates that the status quo does not work,” Titus said. “That is why I led an effort to provide funding in this year’s Interior appropriations bill for safe and humane birth control.”"}, {"title": "Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal Wouldn’t Remove All Lead Pipes", "text": "President Joe Biden has repeatedly bragged that the bipartisan infrastructure bill germinating in the U.S. Senate will spur the removal of America’s toxic drinking water pipes made of lead.“It will put plumbers and pipe fitters to work replacing all of the nation’s lead water pipes, so every child and every American can turn on the faucet at home or school and drink clean water,” Biden said last week, “including in low-income communities and communities of color that have been disproportionally affected by dangerous lead pipes.”But the bill does not require water utilities to replace lead pipes. Rather, it provides $15 billion to a revolving fund that utilities can use to replace lead pipes if they want ― something that’s only happened in a handful of cities to date.“Unless the utilities are required to do it, we’re concerned that a lot of utilities won’t,” Erik Olson, a water policy expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, told HuffPost.Biden originally proposed $45 billion for removing lead pipes as part of what the White House called the American Jobs Plan, an early outline of the infrastructure bill. That sum reflected the expert consensus about how much it would cost to remove the roughly 10 million lead service lines connecting water mains to buildings around the country.Replacing a single service line can cost thousands of dollars, because it typically requires digging up the ground in front of the building to get at the pipe. Water utilities have insisted they’re not responsible for the portions of pipe that lie within someone’s property line, making removal a huge collective action problem.The infrastructure bill, as drafted, would plow just $15 billion earmarked for pipe replacement into the Environmental Protection Agency’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. The bill would not amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require utilities to replace the pipes.“Is it going to be enough to deal with every lead pipe in the country? Probably not, but we’ll make great progress,” Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, told HuffPost.Fifteen billion dollars is certainly more than Congress has ever allocated for lead pipe removal. Lawmakers in 2016 allocated $100 million for lead pipe replacement in Flint, Michigan, after the city suffered an egregious spike in water lead ― which state and federal officials initially dismissed, even though the city’s corroded lead pipes were spewing brown water into Flint homes.But $15 billion is probably not enough to get all the pipes. The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated there are somewhere between 9.7 million and 12.8 million lead service lines in the 50 states, and the EPA puts the average pipe replacement cost at $4,700 ― meaning $45 billion would be almost enough to get them all.Biden, however, has said almost every day that the bill will get the whole job done with $15 billion.“It’s going to eliminate all lead pipes in America, so people have decent drinking water,” Biden said Monday during a Democratic fundraiser. A White House fact sheet on Tuesday said the bill will replace “all of the nation’s lead pipes.”The White House insisted to HuffPost on Tuesday that even with less money than Biden himself originally proposed, the bill will eradicate lead pipes from the U.S.“The bipartisan agreement will eliminate all lead drinking water pipes and service lines in the United States with this unprecedented funding ― full stop,” spokesman Andrew Bates said, noting that the bill would give states an additional $11 billion for general drinking water funding that they could put toward lead pipe replacement.Lead is a deadly neurotoxin, and drinking water that’s flowed through lead pipes can lower young children’s IQs and increase the risk of pregnant women suffering miscarriages. Lead has been known to be unhealthy since Roman times, but it’s a soft metal that’s good for making pipes, and in the 20th century the lead industry encouraged cities to use it for water lines.The Safe Drinking Water Act requires utilities to test water samples from people’s homes and treat the water to make it less corrosive to lead pipes. Utilities only have to replace the pipes if the home water samples show excessive amounts of lead, creating a strong incentive for them to avoid testing in homes known to have lead service lines.Under Biden, the EPA suspended the Trump administration’s pending revision to its drinking water lead regulation, which has been in limbo for years.“These lead lines will last forever unless you take ’em out,” Harold Harrington, a master plumber in Flint, Michigan, said Tuesday during a conference call with the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters and the green business group E2.The groups called attention to an economic impact analysis of Biden’s original lead pipe proposal, which found that it would create and support 56,080 good-paying jobs annually for a decade. The proposal in the bipartisan infrastructure bill would do less.“Fifteen billion will not get the job done,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.Y.) ― the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, one of the few U.S. cities to replace all its lead service lines ― said the Senate is squandering its opportunity to replace pipes nationwide.“This is the moment for America to do it,” Booker told HuffPost. “It actually saves us money in the long run, because children with lead poisoning are far less productive and have far higher medical costs.”Booker lamented “the moral obscenity of having our best talent poisoned” in such a preventable way.“I live in a community that’s seen and ravages of lead poisoning for decades now with lead paint, lead water,” he said. “We have a moral obligation to do this.”"}, {"title": "The Biden Administration Won’t Explain Its Handout To Big Coal", "text": "One week after being sworn in, President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order aimed at “tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad.” It included seemingly clear language about ending subsidies for the industry most responsible for planetary warming.“The heads of agencies shall identify for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the National Climate Advisor any fossil fuel subsidies provided by their respective agencies, and then take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, Federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels,” the order reads.The order also directed the secretary of the interior to “consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs.”No one anticipated that would mean reducing the fees drilling and mining companies pay to extract fossil fuels from federal lands.Yet Biden’s Interior Department did just that, quietly approving Arch Resource’s request for royalty relief at two of its coal mines, West Elk in Colorado and Coal Creek in Wyoming, as E&E News first reported last week.The St. Louis, Missouri-based company made its request for relief last year when the Trump administration was in office, and the Bureau of Land Management approved it in May. Arch Resources, formerly Arch Coal, is the second largest coal supplier in the country. It is also a former client of Interior Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau, though the rate reduction was approved before Beaudreau’s confirmation.Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado Boulder, called the approval “outrageous” and said he’d like to believe it was some kind of mistake.“A royalty reduction like this is essentially a subsidy,” he said. “Somebody’s asleep at the switch here.”Squillace noted that Arch reported a net income of $27.9 million in the second quarter of this year, when the cuts were approved.“They clearly do not need this relief,” he said.At the open-pit Coal Creek mine, which Arch is planning to shut down in fall 2022, the administration agreed to lower the royalty rate from 12.5% to 2% for two years, according to E&E News. At West Elk, an underground mine, the rate dropped from 12.5% to 5% for three years.The administration has promised aggressive action to rein in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Its explanation of the Arch royalty cuts is as perplexing as the decision itself.“The royalty relief process allows the BLM to provide temporary relief for mines to determine if they may remain viable,” a spokesperson for Interior’s Bureau of Land Management told HuffPost by email. The breaks for Arch mines allow “for time to see if potential technological advances, such as methane capture, will work,” the spokesperson said. “Additionally, the reduced rate allows for the recovery of ore that would not otherwise be economic, and thus encourages the greatest ultimate recovery.”BLM did not respond to several of HuffPost’s specific questions, including how the decision squares with the administration’s climate goals. The White House, which this week told The New York Times that the administration “has been very clear about marshaling an all-of-government approach that makes climate change a critical piece of our domestic, national security and foreign policy,” did not answer questions and referred HuffPost to the Interior Department.Arch Resources did not respond to a request for comment.The Interior Department has no obligation to grant companies’ requests for royalty relief. As for promoting the “greatest economic recovery,” Squillace noted that “this argument could be used to justify eliminating royalty payments entirely.”“How is this reduction going to impact state and federal revenues and how does this decision impact the Administration’s climate policies?” he asked. “Just as the Secretary has the discretion to reduce royalties she has the discretion to refuse to reduce these royalties and I have little doubt that denying this request would have been a better decision both from the perspective of economics and the environment.”In a March letter, the Sierra Club and several other environmental groups urged the director of BLM’s Colorado office to deny Arch’s request for royalty relief at the West Elk mine.“Subsidizing coal mines through ongoing royalty relief directly contributes to the climate crisis, contradicting this administration’s policy,” the organizations wrote at the time.Biden has come under fire from some of the same climate and environmental groups that largely applauded his early efforts. His administration has worked to uphold a number of Trump-era energy projects, including the previous administration’s decision to approve ConocoPhillips’ massive Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve last year. The $6 billion project, which is slated to produce 590 million barrels of oil over 30 years, has been a major priority of Alaska’s Republican delegation.On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to “transition away from the oil industry.” And the Interior Department is in the process of reviewing the federal oil and gas leasing program. Yet permits to drill for oil and gas on public lands have increased under Biden’s watch."}, {"title": "Hundreds Of Sharks Swarm Florida Canal To Escape Red Tide", "text": "Hundreds of coastal sharks have flocked to a Florida canal in what experts said is an effort to take refuge from a catastrophic algal bloom that has wreaked havoc on ocean life in the region.In recent weeks, canals in Buttonwood Harbor, near Sarasota, have been teeming with sharks, including bonnethead, black tip, nurse and lemon sharks, leaving area residents stunned.“You literally could have walked across the canal on the backs of sharks — that’s how many there were,” Longboat Key resident Janelle Branower told WFLA-TV.Red tide outbreaks, which are caused by the Karenia brevis algae, have been an issue on Florida’s west coast for several years. The organism occurs naturally in ocean water, but runoff from human activities can provide excess nutrients for the algae. That pollution, coupled with warming waters tied to climate change, can lead to uncontrollable algal blooms that kill marine organisms.According to conservation groups, this year’s outbreak has been particularly devastating. Dolphins, manatees, turtles and hundreds of tons of dead fish have piled up on shorelines.The sharks are likely seeking sanctuary in the canals away from the polluted ocean water, experts said.“We don’t know what the trigger might be for those sharks going to those areas, but the changes in the chemistry of the water, the oxygen being pulled out of the water, the toxins, combined with the amount of dead fish around, any of those could cause these big concentrations,” Mike Heithaus, a shark expert and biological sciences professor at Florida International University, told The Guardian.Scientists are concerned that the heavily-packed waterways will be depleted of resources for the sharks before the red tide subsides.“If there’s not enough oxygen, they will overexert themselves trying to get fresh water over their gills so they can exchange their CO2 for oxygen. But with all those animals packed in that space, oxygen is limiting,” Mote Marine Laboratory senior biologist Jack Morris told FOX13 Tampa Bay.If the red tide lasts for long enough, Morris said, the sharks could “run out of food and energy and unfortunately some of them, if not all of them, will die.”The area is several miles from the defunct Piney Point fertilizer plant, which experienced a significant spill in April that saw hundreds of millions of gallons of wastewater pumped into Tampa Bay. It’s not yet clear whether the breach exacerbated the algae outbreak.In 2019, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) started the Red Tide Task Force as part of his administration’s efforts to mitigate the blooms in the state. Local communities and conservation groups have called on DeSantis to do more to combat the ecological crisis, including declaring a state of emergency."}, {"title": "Bee Swarm Attack In Arizona Kills Man, Injures Several Others", "text": "A horrifying attack by a swarm of bees in an Arizona neighborhood killed a man and injured a number of other people.At least six area residents were stung “multiple times“ in the attack Thursday in the Tucson suburb of Marana, according to fire officials.Three victims, believed to have been stung “hundreds of times,” were transported for medical evaluation. One of them, a man who was not identified by authorities, later died.Three firefighters responding to the emergency were also stung several times.A large bee hive, weighing about 100 pounds, was located in a tree in the neighborhood and removed.“Bee handlers have killed most of the bees and have removed the hive,” according to a statement from the Marana Police Department. “Although the area is much safer, there are still some lingering bees. Please continue to use caution while in the area.”Most Arizona swarms involve Africanized honey bees, a cross between African and European bees, but they are not “killer bees,” according to the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson.“Africanized honey bees do not fly out in angry swarms to randomly attack unlucky victims,” according to the center.Swarms of bees, which are leaving their parent colony to start a new hive, are “generally docile regardless of type” because they have nothing to protect, the center noted. But the bees can become “highly defensive” when protecting their hives.A good “safety precaution” is to stay the “width of a four-lane highway” from any African honey bee hive, the center advises.Just days before the Arizona attack, two dogs were killed in a backyard in Los Angeles by an angry swarm of “thousands” of bees, said the homeowner, who was stung multiple times as he tried to save the animals.From 2000 through 2017, an average of 62 people died each year from bee, wasp and hornet stings, according to a 2019 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."}, {"title": "Oregon Investing $220 Million To Handle Growing Wildfire Problem", "text": "As the country’s largest wildfire so far this year burns across Oregon, the state’s Gov. Kate Brown (D) signed a bill Friday that invests another $220 million in the wildfire prevention, preparedness and response needed for “fires of this new age,” she said.As Brown signed the bill, the Bootleg fire in southern Oregon had burned more than 413,000 acres and threatened to grow even bigger in the coming days. It’s just one of many large blazes to have spread across the drought-stricken state this year.“This year alone, we’ve already had nine major fires burned across Oregon ― twice as many as we had this time last year,” Brown said Friday. “Those on the front line will tell you that the Bootleg fire has behaved like no fire they have ever seen before, doubling in size each of the first several days and creating its own weather pattern.”The $220 million investment builds on an effort Brown started in 2019 when she launched the Wildfire Council to investigate the challenges and solutions to the state’s growing wildfire problem. But the 2019 legislative session ended before lawmakers could pass any of the council’s recommendations for improving wildfire response, fire adaptability in communities and resiliency in Oregon’s landscapes. The bill investing in and implementing those strategies was reintroduced at the start of 2021, and Brown signed it into law Friday.Oregon needs to modernize its approach to wildfires, which have grown bigger and more frequent across the western U.S. as climate change exacerbates heat and drought in the region.“As we responded to these fires over the past couple of years ... it was really clear that we were battling with tools used in the last century,” Brown reflected Friday. “We were simply not equipped to fight the fires of this new age, which are faster and more fierce and fueled by the impacts of climate change.”Brown was one of several governors to meet virtually with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday to discuss ways the federal government can better assist with wildfire response.“We can’t ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors ― extreme heat, prolonged drought and supercharged wildfire conditions ― are affecting the country,” Biden said. “And so this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action.”It’s a sharp pivot from former President Donald Trump, who frequently dismissed the role climate change played in wildfires and told Californians they merely needed to “rake” their forest floors better, even though many of the state’s biggest fires have happened on federally managed land. Last year, he turned down California’s request for wildfire disaster assistance. A former official in his administration also revealed that Trump didn’t want to give California any wildfire aid because it was a blue state.Other governors present were Gavin Newsom (D) of California, Brad Little( R) of Idaho, Tim Walz (D) of Minnesota, Greg Gianforte (R) of Montana, Jay Inslee (D) of Washington and Mark Gordon (R) of Wyoming."}, {"title": "'Real Life' SpongeBob SquarePants And Patrick Star Spotted In Atlantic Ocean", "text": "Who got caught on camera deep under the sea?SpongeBob SquarePants, or at least, the cartoon character’s real-life doppelgänger, along with a dead ringer for his sidekick, Patrick.“I normally avoid these refs..but WOW.

It’s the same mine his father worked at, raising Argo on good union wages and excellent health care coverage. When Argo followed in his father’s footsteps, he believed the job would get better with time and seniority. Instead, he said the job has only gotten worse.“I’m working more than I ever have, and I’m making less money,” said Argo, a 33-year-old longwall miner who logs 10- to 12-hour days, 20 miles deep in the mine.Argo estimates that he now earns $20,000 less per year than he did six years ago, before the mine emerged from bankruptcy under the ownership of a new company called Warrior Met Coal.In 2016, Argo and other members of the United Mine Workers of America agreed to a series of concessions to put Warrior Met on sound financial footing. They lost premium pay for Sundays and long shifts. They went from 11 paid company holidays per year to three: Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas. And they consented to a significantly higher share of health care costs than under previous contracts.According to Argo and other miners, those sacrifices were meant to be temporary. But they said the company has insisted on keeping lower standards in a new five-year contract, leading them into a 1,100-worker strike that began April 1 and has lasted four months. It is a massive work stoppage that harkens back to the days of a more robust coal industry.Large-scale strikes like the one at Warrior Met are rare in the United States, and not just in the coal industry. Only eight work stoppages involving a thousand workers or more took place last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though that figure may have been unusually low due to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, there were 25 work stoppages of that size. Most strikes, however, last a matter of days or weeks, not months.Many of the striking workers bussed from Alabama to Manhattan this week to hold a rally Wednesday outside the offices of the investment firm BlackRock. It was an attempt to pressure Warrior Met’s largest shareholder into supporting a contract proposal that would put an end to the strike and get the miners back to work. BlackRock has said it believes in “sustainable investing,” which the firm defines as “investing in progress.”UMWA President Cecil Roberts said in a statement that the miners were “simply following the money, and demanding that those who created that wealth, the miners, get their fair share of it.”Unlike the thermal coal used for power, Warrior Met produces coking or metallurgical coal (sometimes just called met coal), which is used to make steel. The company calls itself “the leading producer and exporter of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry,” sending coal to Europe, Asia and South America.Among those who made the journey north was Argo’s friend Chris Burke, who’d never been to New York City before. He started working at Warrior Met four years ago. He said the contract that came out of bankruptcy is “one of the worst ones around” for mines in the area. The company’s new offer was so subpar, he said, that the decision to strike was an easy one.“They’re taking advantage of us,” said Burke, who has two kids. “It’s the same coal as the neighbor mine up the road. … It’s all met coal. But it’s the lowest paid. We just want to make it equal.”A Warrior Met spokesperson said the company was “committed” to reaching a deal with the union and had offered some increases in pay and benefits during negotiations.“We have and will continue to work with the UMWA to reach a fair and reasonable contract that provides our employees with a competitive package while protecting jobs and ensuring the longevity of the Company,” the spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost.Phil Smith, a spokesperson for the union, said the company and union officials were back at the bargaining table this week but remained far apart on most of the key issues. Union members overwhelmingly voted down a contract offer made in April.Union members said they used to pay almost nothing for health care coverage, but after the bankruptcy they started paying a $1,500 deductible and a 20% copay. The low insurance costs they enjoyed under previous contracts may seem unusually generous, but not for unionized coal mines. Mining comes with so many safety hazards and long-term health risks that members have poured much of their leverage into negotiating low health costs.Many workers said the loss of premium pay has been a greater financial hit. Under the law, they are still eligible for time-and-a-half pay after working 40 hours in a week, but the extra pay used to kick in after eight hours each day under the old contract, Smith said.Emanuel Barnfield, a 13-year veteran at the mine and father of three, said many workers could previously top $100,000 a year by working long hours. They may still work the same bruising schedules, he said, but now they bring home $20,000 or $30,000 less. While the pay might still seem high to outsiders, Barnfield said the job takes a harsh toll on one’s body and family life.“We’re nothing but money to these guys,” he said of the company and its shareholders.Warrior Met said its offer to the union includes a 10% to 12% pay bump for workers, along with additional time off and a “relaxed” attendance policy, although the company did not provide details. Several workers in interviews criticized what they called the company’s “four strikes” attendance policy that could lead to termination, saying it didn’t allow leniency for absences due to health problems or emergencies.Tefere Gebre, executive vice president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said he sees the Warrior Met strike as a continuation of the walkouts that began with West Virginia teachers in 2018.“Billionaires are shooting themselves into space while mine workers are saying, ‘How am I going to feed my kids?’” Gebre said. “These are people who can least afford to be out on strike for more than 100 days.”The strike affects two separate mines as well as a preparation plant and a mechanical shop at Warrior Met. The union said roughly 60 members of the bargaining unit have crossed the picket line to continue working, while the company has also brought in outside contractors as replacements.The union has maintained picket lines at a series of sites outside mine property. Warrior Met obtained an injunction limiting how many strikers and supporters can be at each site, so that workers can still easily get on company property. The picket lines can be tense and downright dangerous. The union said it’s counted at least four instances in which drivers heading onto mine property struck picketers. It has released video showing two of those incidents, calling them “company-inspired violence.”Amy Pilkteron, whose husband, Greg, works at the mine, said she was struck by a car and spun around while on a picket line July 8, leaving her right side bruised. She said her back is still “out of whack” and she’s been visiting a chiropractor.“I’m just thankful I wasn’t a couple of steps back, because then he would have hit me full force,” Pilkteron said.The company spokesperson said that ​​“Warrior Met Coal does not condone any acts of violence.”Strikers have been receiving $700 every two weeks from the union’s strike fund. The drop in income has left many people relying on an auxiliary powered by miners’ wives. They’ve been bringing in donations and putting together free grocery bags and back-to-school supplies for families.Haeden Wright, a schoolteacher serving as the auxiliary’s president, said it takes an enormous amount of effort to sustain a strike for four months. Her husband, Braxton, is a Warrior Met miner, and her father worked at the mine under its previous ownership.“What people don’t understand is to have a successful strike that can last this long, it’s a whole lot more than just picket lines,” Wright said. “You have to have people who support you. It’s mutual aid.”A lot of strikers have taken on second jobs to support their families during the strike, working on days they aren’t picketing. Barnfield has been driving a tow truck for one of his friends to make ends meet. Argo has been cutting grass on the side.Burke said he assumed the strike would last a couple of months, not as long as it has. Still, he hasn’t taken on any new work.“I live on the picket line,” he said."}, {"title": "NYC Is More Addicted To Fossil Fuels Than Ever. Now It May Make Solar Harder To Build.", "text": "Still traumatized by 2012’s deadly Superstorm Sandy, New York City has in recent years sued oil giants, divested its pension funds of coal stocks, and outlined lofty plans to protect the coastal metropolis from rising seas and extreme weather.Yet this year the nation’s largest city became more dependent on fossil fuels for its electricity as the nuclear plant that provided most of its zero-carbon electricity shut down and a plan to build a transmission line to carry hydropower down to the Hudson River from dams in Canada, first proposed in 2008, continued to flounder.With limited space to build renewables and political power over its own infrastructure, glazing rooftops across the five boroughs with solar panels is widely seen as the easiest and most affordable way to generate renewable power within city limits ― and a source of jobs and training for an industry set for exponential growth if the U.S. fulfills its climate goals.But two looming policy changes threaten to make rooftop solar harder and more expensive to build.The state program that financed solar projects on the roofs of some of the poorest and most pollution-plagued New Yorkers is poised to run out of money as early as the end of summer, in part because a loophole allowed fossil fuel infrastructure to use up a giant chunk of the funding.And the city’s fire department advanced new codes that could significantly shrink the amount of roof space available for solar equipment and create costly new requirements for building owners looking to add panels.“There’s no pot at the end of the rainbow for people building and installing solar in New York City,” said Shyam Mehta, the executive director of the New York Solar Energy Industries Association. “It’s very difficult already. These policy issues make it more so.”New York state created its community solar program in 2015 to subsidize the construction of panels to which renters, barred from building atop roofs they don’t own, could subscribe and lower their bills. It took a few years to get off the ground in New York City and its northern suburb of Westchester County, the area served by the private utility monopoly Consolidated Edison. In 2018, the program produced 3 megawatts of panels within the ConEd service area.A year later, that number swelled more than sevenfold to 22 megawatts.In 2020, however, that number soared to 89 megawatts, making community solar by far the fastest-growing segment of the city’s solar sector.For residents of New York City’s sprawling public housing complexes, the program brought hope to places that most often offer examples of what happens when a super-rich metropolis fails to protect its poorest residents: Mold and pest infestations, lead-poisoned babies, grandparents left to freeze in winter without heat and roast in summer without air conditioning.In the meantime, the program has created nearly two dozen temporary jobs, with the majority of workers finding work in solar after installations were completed.Lugging cinder blocks across the roof of a public housing development in south Brooklyn in March, Sarah Bellow, a New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) resident who lost her job during the pandemic, said getting hired to install solar panels offered reprieve from the “mental effect of not working.”“I love it,” Bellow told NY1 of the job. “I love every aspect of it.”Kelvin Casimiro, a 22-year-old NYCHA resident, similarly struggled to find work after he was laid off last year until a nonprofit working with the community solar program recruited him to build panels atop the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing complex in North America.“I have applied for solar jobs before but have not received any positive answers because I had no prior experience in solar installations,” Casimiro said in an official NYCHA newsletter last month. “It is a great opportunity, because solar jobs are on the rise. Everyone is interested.”Yet as the solar projects ramped up, a loophole allowed natural gas-fired fuel cells to eat up more than 160 megawatts’ worth of funding in the community solar program. By the time state regulators closed the loophole in 2019, the fossil fuel equipment used up about half the funding available for the New York City service area.In March, the city government, NYCHA, and a handful of solar nonprofits filed a petition with the state Public Service Commission requesting the state extend the program, which was set to run out of funding. At the very least, they asked that the state replace the funding the fossil fuel projects used up so they could go to solar projects instead. Roughly 40 megawatts of funding remain in the program, said Mehta, who estimated those will run out in, at most, three months.Without an extension, Mehta said “most solar projects will become uneconomically viable overnight.”The commission said it was “reviewing all options given the concerns raised by the industry, and we are carefully considering the comments submitted in the community solar program.” The body meets once per month, meaning it likely has no more than two sessions to address the issue before the program suffers a funding shortfall.In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office said it was urging the commission to expand the program “given the acute need to transition away from fossil fuels.”While advocates and solar installers wait nervously, analysts say the state is likely to keep the program going.“Speculatively, I would not be surprised if they extend it because it’s clearly been clearly effective,” said Pol Lezcano, a solar analyst at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF.The New York City Fire Department’s proposed new codes could affect virtually all new rooftop solar projects in the city.The department called on the city to revise the fire code to leave six-feet-wide openings around roof drains and on the perimeters of smaller buildings, and make expensive upgrades to parapet walls.The most challenging measure proposed in the codes was a requirement for building owners to keep 30% of the rooftop facing the rear or any side of the building with windows completely clear of any panels so firefighters can easily traverse the space. Doing so, the Solar Energy Industries Association calculated, would reduce the available area for panels by roughly 40%, and in some cases more.The proposed revisions also include mandates to reinforce parapets on buildings, a requirement solar installers said could make rooftop panels even more expensive.“It’s well understood that New York City’s fire code, as it exists right now, already places more restrictions on rooftop solar construction than any other fire code in the nation,” Mehta said. “Without demonstrating the necessity of these restrictions for firefighters or public safety, it’s a really hard pill to swallow.”In an email to HuffPost, the fire department said it planned to withdraw the 30% proposal and limit “its perimeter access proposal to newly-constructed buildings” over the solar industry’s concerns.“The Department will continue to work with the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Sustainability to address any concerns expressed by clean energy stakeholders,” deputy commissioner Frank Dwyer, the spokesman, said.Lezcano said the existing fire code has “prevented a lot of installers from even looking at the city as a potential new market.”“Unless you’re a city installer and you’re able to afford the time to navigate the bureaucracy and administrative permitting, there’s very little reason for you to be in the city,” he said. “I know of multiple installers who have decided not to expand to New York City because of all the additional work it would require in terms of having people with boots on the ground just to deal with the regulatory aspects.”New York City’s efforts to curb its greenhouse gas emissions have long been dogged by the state’s unwillingness or inability to deliver on them.The city could not, for example, enact new congestion pricing tolls to limit vehicle traffic into Manhattan without legislation passed by the state. Any changes and investments in the subway and system most New Yorkers rely on must also run through Albany, since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is under state control.Even the city’s landmark 2019 climate law ― a mandate for big buildings, the largest energy users in the five boroughs, to install energy efficiency retrofits ― has faced pushback from the state, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) proposed new carve-outs for landlords that critics say would defang the legislation.New York state officials say they want the state to rapidly eliminate carbon from its electricity grid. But as the state charges ahead with implementing its 100% by 2040 clean power law, some fear its eponymous city could become an afterthought. That’s because the state can largely hit some of its early renewable electricity targets with big solar farms in the state’s sparsely populated northern regions, where open space and looser regulations make energy development cheaper.Two projects in or near the city could balance that regional disparity. The first, a proposal to close the notorious jail on Rikers Island and replace it with solar panels and batteries, could create a central hub for some clean electricity production, conveniently near the 500-acre electrical utility complex in northwest Queens. The second, already underway, is an array of offshore wind turbines expected to come online off the coast of Long Island and New Jersey sometime in the next three to four years.In the meantime, however, a different proposal has consumed the attention of pro-renewable lawmakers and environmentalists in the city: a plan to build new gas-fired generators in Queens and Brooklyn.“The city has to come up with a plan to help us mitigate the situation,” said Charles Callaway, the director of organizing at We Act for Environmental Justice, a Harlem-based advocacy group. “We can help our community put solar on top of buildings in a way that we can reduce the amount of emissions and continue to protect firemen.”"}, {"title": "Seeing A Make-or-Break Moment, Climate Groups Plan Blitz Over Congressional Recess", "text": "A coalition of climate-focused groups is readying a multimillion-dollar blitz of advertising, organizing and public events over Congress’s recess in August, seeing it as their best and last opportunity to influence members before Democrats start crafting crucial climate legislation this fall.The coalition will host more than 500 events nationally, aiming to engage more than 1 million Americans, with a focus on states represented by moderate Democrats in the House and Senate who could make or break a deal. In total, the groups appear set to spend more than $20 million over the six-week period when members of the House and Senate leave Washington and head home to hear from their constituents.“This is the moment where we have an opportunity to move forward with bold climate policy, to meet the moment, to meet what science calls for and demands,” said Pete Maysmith, the senior vice president for campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters. “And we know that there is deep and strong support for it around the country. And so really what August is about is mobilizing that support.”After bipartisan negotiations whittled down many of the key climate proposals in President Joe Biden’s infrastructure package, climate groups and Democrats now see a separate piece of legislation ― set to be passed using a process called reconciliation that allows Democrats to bypass the filibuster’s 60 vote requirement ― as key to Biden’s pledge to combat the climate crisis.That legislation is set to be shaped over the course of months, with environmental groups and progressives aiming to include a clean-electricity standard and a civilian climate corps, among other climate-focused goals. But some of those provisions could face resistance from moderate Democrats, including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.In the past, interactions between voters and their members of Congress during the lengthy August recess ― this year’s break is set to run well into September ― have shaped the political mood in Washington, most famously when the so-called tea party Republicans ratcheted up opposition to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The coalition’s goal is to make climate action the dominant and defining issue of this recess.“We know how popular these investments are,” said Felice Stadler, the vice president of campaigns at the Environmental Defense Fund Action. “But if we take our foot off the pedal and just assume that members know that this is important, we’re going to miss our opportunity.”The coalition is made up of more than 100 groups, including BlueGreen Alliance, Climate Action Campaign, Climate Power, Climate Reality, EDF Action, Environment America, the Green New Deal Network, the League of Conservation Voters, the Moms Clean Air Force and the Sierra Club.The events will include everything from roundtables with small-business owners to town halls with members of Congress to an electric bus tour and rallies organized by faith groups.The League of Conservation Voters is hiring 100 canvassers operating out of 15 offices in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia; and the Climate Action Campaign plans to spend $10 million on local organizing campaigns across 12 states and 19 competitive House districts.Climate Power plans to spend $10 million on digital, television and newspaper ads in 29 House districts and five states that are expected to have competitive Senate races. And the Green New Deal network is planning to host 60 events across the country on a single day in August."}, {"title": "Video Shows Salmon With Lesions, Fungus As Rivers Hit Lethal Temperatures", "text": "A disturbing new video is highlighting the devastating effect of recent heat waves on Pacific Northwest salmon, which are suffering from lesions and fungus due to rising water temperatures, according to a nonprofit organization working to protect the waterways.The underwater video shared by Columbia Riverkeeper on Tuesday shows multiple sockeye salmon with large welts and open sores swimming in Washington state’s Little White Salmon River near the Columbia River Gorge on July 16.“Sockeye are dying right now because the Columbia and Snake rivers are too hot,” Brett VandenHeuvel, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement that blamed thermal stress for the condition of the fish. “I’m hopeful this tragedy will inspire our elected leaders to take action to restore our rivers before it is too late.”Temperatures in the Columbia River, which originates in Canada and forms part of the Washington-Oregon border, have well exceeded 68 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature at which salmon face an increased risk of stress, disease and mortality, according to Columbia Riverkeeper.“This is a decades-long issue for Oregon, Washington and the Columbia River tribes,” Michelle Dennehy of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife told HuffPost in response to the video. “We do have some mortality every year, but we’re expecting it to be worse this year because we have the record drought and the heat.”Sockeye salmon are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and Oregon, among other states, has been working to improve the fishes’ migratory passage and to identify and protect cool-water fish refuges. The state also recently imposed emergency fishing restrictions for certain river areas after 2 p.m. when high temperatures make the fish particularly vulnerable to stress, said Dennehy.Oregon, Washington and the Nez Perce Tribe also recently requested that a reservoir in northern Idaho release cold water to help lower temperatures in the Snake River, which runs through Idaho and along the border with Oregon before flowing into Washington. Cold water was released in June to help salmon and steelhead trout ― several weeks ahead of schedule due to extreme heat ― but the federal government declined to do it again, reasoning that it would lead to unsafe boating conditions, Idaho’s Moscow-Pullman Daily News reported.“The state of Oregon has long said that the federal government is failing fish by not providing adequate fish protections in the federally managed river, and that includes adequate water and cool water,” Dennehy said, warning that it’s not just today’s fish at risk, but future generations.That’s because sockeye salmon already face numerous risks while attempting to spawn in freshwater streams, rivers and lakes after migrating inland from the ocean.Adult salmon lay their eggs in these waterways, and one to three years later, the young fish, called smolt, attempt to migrate out to the ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“Smolt may never make it to the ocean due to high temperatures and poor habitat conditions along the way,” said Dennehy. “Poor migratory conditions associated with temperature can also cause returning salmon and steelhead to die before they can reach spawning areas, which will impact the next generation of salmon.”The fish in the video were in an area where they do not spawn, according to Columbia Riverkeeper, suggesting that they had yet to reach the destination where they lay their eggs.“They can’t even make it to their home, to spawn, to reproduce,” Don Sampson of the Northwest Tribal Salmon Alliance said in a separate video shared by the Columbia Riverkeeper. “They’re suffocating. They’re weakened.”Sampson criticized local dams for slowing the flow of water and creating stagnant reservoirs that can overheat. The larger surface area of the water that’s exposed to the sun raises water temperatures as much as 5.7 degrees, according to a 2020 report by the Environmental Protection Agency, which examined the effects of dams on the Snake and Columbia river systems in the Washington state area.“Regulating water temperature is a huge issue,” said Dennehy. “Unfortunately, with climate change, we are expecting these droughts and heat waves to become more frequent and deadly to fish.”Unusually warm temperatures have already been blamed for mass salmon deaths and illness.Earlier this month, salmon in Northern California were reportedly dying from rising water temperatures that threatened the entire local population. In 2015, about 90% of sockeye salmon that entered the Columbia River died from a combination of low water and extended extreme heat that hadn’t been seen since at least the 1950s, The Associated Press reported.This year’s heat waves have also been particularly brutal, with one marine biologist estimating that 1 billion sea creatures recently cooked to death off Canada’s coast."}, {"title": "Deadly Caribbean Coral Disease Linked To Ship Wastewater", "text": "In the latest heartbreaking wounding of the environment, researchers have linked a deadly coral disease in the Caribbean to ship wastewater.The rampaging blight that first hit Florida’s reefs in 2014 has now swept through the Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Maarten and Mexico, reports The Guardian. It’s also been found in 18 other countries.The infection, known as stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), spreads more quickly than other known coral diseases and can travel up to 55 yards in a single day.It also has an exceptionally high mortality rate among the most vulnerable species — and it may be the most lethal disease to ever infect coral. More than 30 species of coral are susceptible to SCTLD.Scientists haven’t yet been able to determine whether the disease is caused by a virus, bacterium, chemical or some other infectious agent.But a new study of SCTLD in the Bahamas — where it was first seen in 2019 — found that the coral disease was more prevalent in reefs that were closer to the main commercial ports in Nassau and Grand Bahama, suggesting that ship wastewater may be to blame for the disease.“Spatial patterns of mortality and infection rates for the most vulnerable species were greatest close to international commercial shipping ports on both islands, suggesting SCTLD has been present in those locations for a longer time, and the proportion of healthy colonies increased with distance from the port,” noted the research by scientists from the Perry Institute for Marine Science in the Bahamas, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science.Researchers noted that the “greatest declines” in coral populations in the Bahamas over the past decade may be “attributed to the recent introduction of stony coral tissue loss disease.”SCTLD has infected coral off Grand Bahama Island along a 46-mile stretch. “That is a large structure of reef,” said Krista Sherman, senior scientist for the Perry Institute and co-author of the study. “We’re talking about mostly covering the entire southern coastline of the island.”The International Maritime Organization implemented the Ballast Water Management Convention in 2017 in response to the spread of deadly pathogens by ships when they discharge ballast water.Under the convention, any ballast water released by ships must be at least 200 nautical miles from shore in water at least 200 meters (656 feet) deep before entering port to ensure the ships do not bring in pathogens.The Bahamian government has established a national task force to address the issue in a nation where pristine water and beautiful coral reefs are a huge draw in the mighty tourist industry.Currently, the most effective treatment for the disease is the antibiotic amoxicillin, applied directly to the corals."}, {"title": "Last Victim ID'd In Florida Condo Building Collapse, Says Family", "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The final victim of the condo building collapse in Florida has been identified, a relative said Monday, more than a month after the middle-of-the-night catastrophe that ultimately claimed 98 lives and became the largest non-hurricane related emergency response in state history.Estelle Hedaya, an outgoing 54-year-old with a love of travel, was the last to be identified, ending what her relatives described as a torturous four-week wait. Her younger brother, Ikey Hedaya, confirmed the news to The Associated Press. A funeral was scheduled for Tuesday.It comes just days after rescuers officially concluded the painstaking and emotionally heavy task of removing layers of dangerous debris and pulling out dozens of bodies.“She always mentioned God anytime she was struggling with anything,” he said, adding he was drawing strength from God, just as he’d seen his sister do in troubling times.The site of the June 24 collapse at the oceanside Champlain Towers South has been mostly swept flat, the rubble moved to a Miami warehouse. Although forensic scientists and rabbis are still at work, including examining the debris at the warehouse, seeking to recover any additional remains and personal items.In the end, crews found no evidence that anyone who was found dead had survived the initial collapse, Fire Chief Alan Cominsky has said.Search teams spent weeks battling the hazards of the rubble, including an unstable portion of the building that teetered above, a recurring fire and Florida’s stifling summer heat and thunderstorms. They went through more than 14,000 tons (13,000 metric tonnes) of broken concrete and rebar before finally declaring the mission complete.“For the past 33 days they have searched the rubble as if they were searching for one of their own,” Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a news conference Monday.Miami-Dade Fire Rescue’s urban search-and-rescue team pulled away from the site Friday in a convoy of firetrucks and other vehicles. Officials saluted their bravery, saying they had worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site and also dealing with the heavy emotional burden.The tragedy that befell the tiny town of Surfside prompted an outpouring of love from far and wide where locals donated their homes and apartments to victims, children colored cards for rescuers, piles and piles of food were donated and tens of millions of dollars raised for the victims.The mayor expressed hope that those kindnesses would be “a powerful and lasting reminder of how deeply connected we truly are in the best of times and in the worst of times.”The dead included members of the area’s large Orthodox Jewish community, the sister of Paraguay’s first lady, her family and their nanny, along with an entire family of four that included a local salesman, his wife and their two young daughters, 4 and 11, who were buried in the same coffin.Linda March, a 58 year-old attorney and fellow former New Yorker, was close friends with Hedaya. Oddly the two were the last three victims to be identified, along with 24-year-old Anastasia Gromova of Canada.Leah Sutton, who knew Hedaya since birth and considered herself a second mother to her, said she and March were both “forces to be reckoned with.”“My two beautiful amazing fearless friends saved for last, have to believe there was a reason for them to be last,” she said Monday. “Estelle’s love of God was unbelievable and unwavering.”Meanwhile, it’s unclear what will happen at the collapse site. A judge presiding over several lawsuits filed in the collapse aftermath wants the property sold at market rates, which would bring in an estimated $100 million or more.

Bill Gates, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are just a few members of the Yellowstone Club, where condos start at around $4 million and mansions fetch upward of $25 million.But in the near future, the club’s “private powder” — yes, it trademarked that phrase — will be generated in part from treated wastewater. The club and the broader community of Big Sky already use effluent to water four area golf courses, and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality has granted the private resort a permit to use more than 25 million gallons of wastewater for early-season snowmaking. The club’s environmental manager, Rich Chandler, has said the move “will help conserve our limited water supply and protect the watershed” by increasing snowpack and helping sustain river flows late in the season.A number of other ski resorts, including Snowbowl in Arizona, have also adopted waste-to-snow reuse, and several environmental and wildlife advocacy groups supported the Yellowstone Club’s effort. But there is something comically dystopian about America’s wealthiest spending a fortune to ski atop each other’s sewage. More seriously, it reflects long-standing water issues in the ritzy, unincorporated resort community of Big Sky, and the environmental costs of the area’s rapid growth.The community has been home to Big Sky Resort, a public ski mountain, since the early 1970s, but the population has doubled in a little more than a decade, from around 1,500 in 2010 to 3,000 today. The 1992 film “A River Runs Through It” helped put this area on the map; many of the fly fishing scenes were filmed on the Gallatin River, a headwaters tributary of the Missouri River and a renowned “blue-ribbon” trout fishery that flows out of the northwest corner of Yellowstone National Park. The pandemic has only added to the boom, with people fleeing large cities to establish permanent residency in Big Sky.Conservationists fear all this is fueling a crisis on the river.Since summer 2005, neon green algae — a telltale sign of an unhealthy river — has plagued the West Fork Gallatin, which flows directly through the resort town, leaving a “green trail” extending downstream of where the tributary dumps into the Gallatin.More recently, the problem has exploded on the river’s main stem. For the last three summers, the noxious algae has choked a large stretch of water around Big Sky, fouling one of the very resources that’s drawn wealthy Americans to gobble up property there. (See top video of drone footage shot by the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper in August 2020, showing a bloom of green algae along the Gallatin River, several miles downstream from the resort community of Big Sky.) An unprecedented bloom in 2018 stretched along more than 20 miles of the river and its tributaries, covering as much as 75% of the river bottom in some locations.Experts are working to pinpoint exactly what’s driving recent blooms, but chronic algae around Big Sky has been largely attributed to nutrient pollution from the area’s ballooning development. Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous occur naturally, but humans contribute even more from our septic tanks and other wastewater treatment systems, fertilizers, and clearing land for development. Pollution from America’s most prosperous is sullying a pristine watershed, with help from climate change-driven increases in air and water temperatures and reduced snowpack and river water levels.This algae is nontoxic, but experts warn it can affect overall river health, reducing oxygen levels in the water and potentially harming fish and the bugs they feed on — never mind its ability to sully an angler’s experience.This summer isn’t expected to be much better on the Gallatin. Montana is experiencing blistering, abnormal heat and drought conditions, and the green gunk is already in bloom.“We have some of the best natural-state streams, and algae blooms are showing they are out of whack,” said Guy Alsentzer, executive director and founder of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, an environmental group based in Bozeman. “Nutrients load the gun. Temperature and heat pulls the trigger.”Three main streams — the West, Middle and South forks of the Gallatin — flow through Big Sky before draining into the river’s main stem a few miles below the resort town. All three have been designated “impaired” waterways for more than a decade due to nutrient loads that exceed state water standards.Kristin Gardner is executive director of the Gallatin River Task Force, a community-based organization that monitors water quality and leads river restoration work. She said nutrient pollution remains a major issue in greater Big Sky, but that worsening climate impacts appear to have spurred the flare ups of algae on the main stem of the Gallatin in the last few years. The blooms were primarily concentrated in waters below the resort community; however, algae also appeared on a tributary upstream of Big Sky where there is little development.“The big change is not an increase in nutrients necessarily, but an increase in temperature and a decrease in stream flows,” she said.Whatever the primary driver, stretches of water this clean and cold shouldn’t be clogged with algae.“If you’d have told me that 20 years ago, I’d have said, ‘That’s silly. That can’t happen,’” said Toby Swank, president of Fins and Feathers, a Bozeman fly shop and guiding outfit. “What’s going on, it’s scary.”Environmentalists worry the river could soon reach a tipping point, when nutrient pollution and global warming unleash unstoppable changes. In light of the situation, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper is calling for the state to designate the main stem Gallatin as “impaired,” which would free up resources, and for a halt in new development until current sources of pollution are identified and addressed. Alsentzer said it is time for a science-based “pollution diet” in Big Sky: for proactive state policies to be implemented before it’s too late.“We shouldn’t be piecemeal approaching what’s happening in the greater community of Big Sky,” he said. “We need to take a holistic approach and the best thing to do right now is to hit pause. We need to hit pause on everything to let the science catch up and direct how we can grow without growth becoming a zero-sum game where the river is the loser.”Instead, the state has continued to greenlight new development that conservationists warn is likely to further degrade water quality on the Gallatin.Two projects in Big Sky Canyon Village, located along the Gallatin River several miles east of the Yellowstone Club and Big Sky proper, have come under intense scrutiny.Lazy J South, a 200-acre residential and commercial development, first received a state groundwater discharge permit in 2006, but there’s been no construction. A new owner purchased the property last year and subsequently got approval from the state environmental quality department — or DEQ — to construct a septic system under the 14-year-old wastewater discharge permit.Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and Montana Environmental Information Center filed a lawsuit this month arguing that the DEQ failed to consider the cumulative effects that the development would have on water resources. The groups note in their legal filing that Lazy J South, which will sit less than half a mile from the Gallatin, could result in up to a 20% increase in total discharged septic pollution into area ground and surface water.“The Montana DEQ is asleep at the switch when it comes to protecting our water from irresponsible subdivisions and poorly planned development,” Derf Johnson, an attorney with the Montana Environmental Quality Information Center, said in a statement.A second development, known as Big Sky Quarry, is being marketed as a solution to the area’s shortage of workforce and affordable housing, although it’s not yet clear how much the units will cost. Big Sky Rock LLC is behind the 265-unit condo and family home development, which will be located just 800 feet from the Gallatin River.Project engineers initially had plans for a single, centralized water treatment system at the Quarry, but suddenly switched gears in 2018 for a series of septic systems that each fall below the gallon-per-day threshold that would require obtaining a discharge permit subject to a more stringent environmental review, according to documents Waterkeeper obtained via state public records requests and shared with HuffPost.The emails indicate the developers changed course only after conversations with state regulators.“I was recently contacted by one of the project consultant engineers and told that they may no longer be seeking a discharge permit due to their recent conversation with [DEQ Subdivision Section Supervisor] Rachel Clark,” Chris Boe of the DEQ ’s Water Protection Bureau wrote in an August 2018 email to colleagues. Boe noted that his bureau had been working with Big Sky Rock LLC for more than two years on its abandoned centralized system, an effort that included “discussing discharge permitting options, and their need to analyze for cumulative effects and potential impacts to surface water.”The DEQ insisted that Quarry engineers were considering multiple septic systems long before agency staff sat down with project engineers for a pre-application meeting in November 2018. In response to HuffPost’s inquiry, the department produced an April 2017 memo in which one Quarry engineer notes that systems discharging more than 5,000 gallons per day require permits that “tend to take 12-18 months of review and are subject to public notice,” and that a phased system with each unit falling below that threshold “is an option to consider.”“The engineer came to the pre-application meeting with a proposal for multiple Level 2 septic systems,” DEQ spokesperson Moira Davin said in an email, adding that the planned system treats wastewater better than a standard septic system.Water and Environmental Technologies, an environmental consulting firm based in Butte, Montana, was brought on to assist with the Quarry project in 2018. Michael Nicklin, a senior consultant at the company, told HuffPost he recommended the developer consider using SepticNet, a modular septic system patented in 2006 that reduces nitrogen levels in wastewater to below the drinking water standard. Scott Altman, owner of Big Sky Rock LLC, the company behind the Quarry project, said the decision to use SepticNet was “based on the length of build out and getting the best treatment possible at every stage.”The Quarry will be the first development in Big Sky to use the technology, according to David Erickson, a co-owner of SepticNet and the founder of Water and Environmental Technologies.Erickson said the problem in Big Sky isn’t the Quarry, which he applauded for its “state of the art treatment proposal,” but rather current development with antiquated septic systems.“You’ve got all these grandfathered systems going in that we know are causing water quality problems, but there’s no way to stop them at this point,” he said.For Alsentzer, the bottom line is that the DEQ has the ability to require more of new developers given the existing problems on the Gallatin, but has instead chosen to grant categorical exclusions and ignore cumulative environmental effects. The river and landscape are suffering “a nefarious death by a thousand cuts,” he said.“We have an entire system of government that is corporate captured,” Alsentzer said. “If there’s ever a theme in Montana, it’s that our agencies aren’t looking out for the public anymore. They’re not looking out for the intrinsic value of our rivers or how to protect them from harm. They’re looking at how to incentivize and streamline business. They’re looking at how to make more money.”Among the documents Waterkeeper unearthed via its public records request is a state engineer’s response to Boe’s email about the Quarry’s change of plans. In it, John McDunn flagged a Montana administrative rule that gives the DEQ broad authority to “impose specific requirements for sewage treatment and disposal as are necessary and appropriate to” to protect water quality.Davin, the DEQ spokesperson, said the agency shares concerns about nutrients and algae in the Gallatin River and is supporting the Gallatin River Task Force’s monitoring and river restoration efforts with both state funding and technical assistance. As for DEQ’s authority to implement new safeguards, Davin said that “additional monitoring is needed before we can determine whether any additional requirements or limitations would be part of next steps.”When HuffPost reached John Meyer, executive director of Cottonwood Environmental Law Center, by phone last week, he was at the sewer district watching a hydrologist put fluorescent tracer dye into the wastewater holding ponds.Last summer, his firm and two conservation groups filed a lawsuit against the sewer district alleging that polluted water is leaching from the facility into the West Fork, in violation of the Clean Water Act, and that the district is irrigating a Big Sky golf course with treated wastewater with elevated levels of nitrogen. The dye will determine if wastewater is in fact making its way from the ponds to the West Fork.Meyer’s firm filed a motion in February asking a federal judge to bar the district from adding new sewer hookups, which would essentially impose a de facto moratorium on new development until the sewer district decreases nitrogen levels in its wastewater. The court is scheduled to hold a hearing next month for arguments in the case.Big Sky’s water problems have almost certainly been exacerbated by the fact that the community is unincorporated, located in two separate counties and without the kind of central, municipal government that might, for example, enforce building codes.Developers, real estate agents, and resort and land managers sit on the boards of the local resort tax organization, the Big Sky community and recreation nonprofit, the sewer and water district, and the Gallatin River Task Force.People HuffPost interviewed for this story described it, among other things, as the “Wild West,” a sort of “fiefdom,” and a “company town” with little oversight and where residents’ incomes and livelihoods are directly tied to the lucrative development boom.And this isn’t just any boom. From February 2020 to February 2021, the median price of a single family home in greater Big Sky jumped an astonishing 65%, from $1.72 million to $2.85 million.“If anyone could do better, in terms of using technology, investments and science to figure out a way to control its impact on the waterway, [Big Sky] could do it,” Alsentzer said.The biggest hurdle to future growth and development is treating and disposing of wastewater. With its nearly 20-year-old sewage treatment facility nearing capacity, Big Sky has had its back against the wall. The Yellowstone Club’s waste-to-snow effort will help alleviate some of the pressure, but not nearly enough.Late last year, the Gallatin County Commission signed off on the formation of a new sewer and water district in Gallatin Canyon ― a first step toward a more centralized system in greater Big Sky. Additionally, the Big Sky County Water and Sewer District is set to begin construction this summer on a nearly $50 million upgrade to its existing water treatment facility. Phase one of the project, slated to be complete in 2023, will increase the plant’s capacity by roughly 50% and significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loads in treated water. A second phase will connect homes and subdivisions in Big Sky Canyon Valley, including the Quarry project, to the upgraded wastewater facility. Sewage from the canyon will be piped to Big Sky and treated, and the district is currently exploring different options for disposal, including groundwater discharge and reuse, according to Ron Edwards, general manager of the Big Sky Water and Sewer District and a member of the Gallatin River Task Force board.“Towns of 3,000 people don’t build $50 million treatment plants,” Edwards said. For Big Sky to take on such a project is “a statement of what we believe in” as a headwaters community, he added.Montana state Sen. Pat Flowers (D-Belgrade), who represents Big Sky, called the planned infrastructure upgrades a “glimmer of hope on the horizon” but voiced concern about what will happen to water quality on the Gallatin in the years before the project is complete.“It’s the natural resource legacy that we’ve all been able to enjoy,” he said. “That includes clean and cold water. If we don’t have that, it really does cascade negatively to affect our enjoyment of this place, but also the economy.”Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) wants to see these resources forever safeguarded from pollution and special interests. He’s introduced legislation to designate 377 miles of rivers, including a 39-mile stretch of the upper Gallatin, as “wild and scenic,” the highest level of federal protection for waterways.Montana politicians love to recite the old adage that in Big Sky Country “whiskey is for drinking — water is for fighting.” And they’re quick to tout the clean rivers and wild trout that draw so many outdoor enthusiasts to the state each year.“The fishery has never been stronger,” Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) said of the upper Missouri River in a May video about businesses in small towns like Craig gearing up for a busy summer season after a tough year during the coronavirus pandemic.That same week, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper alerted the DEQ to decomposing biological “gunk” extending along several miles of the Missouri River just above Craig. In a May 20 email response, which Waterkeeper shared with HuffPost, DEQ water quality supervisor ​​Darrin Kron wrote that “this condition does seem out of the ordinary for this time of year,” that the substance “could be a combo of last fall’s algae that is dead, and new growth,” but that his section is “very low on technical staffing resources at this time and can’t get out for monitoring or investigation.”Montana’s water woes aren’t limited to Big Sky or even the upper Missouri River. It’s in the middle of a statewide drought emergency declaration; more than one-third of its river miles are impaired by nutrient pollution; scientists have documented a severe decline in brown trout populations across the southwest part of the state; and each summer brings new harmful algal blooms and fish kills. Last week, a coalition of fly fishing businesses and conservation groups sent a letter to Gianforte warning that “Montana’s world-class cold water fisheries are dwindling away.”These mounting threats come as Gianforte plows ahead with a regressive environmental agenda. He has largely dismissed and ignored the threat of climate change, which threatens to devastate cold-water trout fisheries. Two weeks before his video along the Missouri River, the governor signed into law a bill that scrapped the numeric nutrient standards the state adopted just six years ago to better protect its water resources and prevent the kind of nutrient pollution that drives algal blooms, fish kills and other environmental threats. More recently, he withdrew Montana from a bipartisan coalition of more than two dozen states committed to upholding the goals of the Paris climate agreement, then turned around two days later and pleaded for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare a drought emergency across his state.“We’re dismantling our water quality laws in Montana. How do you think that’s going to play out for our trout fisheries?” Pat Byorth, a former state fisheries biologist who now works for Trout Unlimited and serves on the state Fish and Wildlife Commission, said on the fly fishing company Orvis’ podcast this week.“You’ve got to protect habitat if you want healthy fish,” he added.Meanwhile, Gianforte is appealing to anglers and outdoor enthusiasts, inviting them to come enjoy “the last best place.”“Whether you imagine yourself knee deep in a crystal clear mountain stream, or soaking in the splendor of a Montana sunset on a quiet evening,” he wrote for the state’s tourism website, “Montana-made moments await you.”"}, {"title": "Oregon Gov. Warns Of 'Harsh Reality' Amid Mammoth Bootleg Fire", "text": "Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) warned Sunday the state would likely see more devastating wildfires linked to climate change as firefighters continue to battle the mammoth Bootleg Fire, the largest blaze in the United States this year that is still burning near the state’s border with California.Brown made the comments on CNN’s “State of the Union,” telling host Jake Tapper that an increase in extreme weather, including heat waves and drought, linked to climate change made it urgently important for wildlife officials to prepare for future blazes.“The harsh reality is that we’re going to see more of these wildfires,” Brown told Tapper. “They’re hotter, they’re more fierce, and obviously much more challenging to tackle. And they are a sign of the changing climate impacts.”She continued: “Climate change is here, it’s real, and it’s like a hammer hitting us in the head. And we have to take action.”Oregon has already suffered from several natural disasters in recent months, including the unprecedented “heat dome” that settled over the Pacific Northwest in June. Around 100 people died in the state due to phenomenal temperatures that reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas, a figure Brown said at the time was only a “harbinger of things to come.”The Bootleg Fire, which began July 6, is the third-largest fire in Oregon since 1900 and is just 46% contained, prompting fire officials to warn Sunday that it could grow due to ongoing hot, dry conditions. It’s already scorched more than 401,000 acres of forest and grassland, and as The New York Times notes, has grown so large it’s creating its own weather patterns.Officials said the fire spawned a tornado earlier this month.Brown added that the federal government had helped support the state as it battled the blaze, but said it would remain a multibillion-dollar issue not just for Oregon, but for adjoining states.“It’s incredibly important with climate change that we get into these forests and start doing the fitting and harvest and prescriptive burning, so that we can create healthier landscapes that are more resilient, for wildfire,” the governor said Sunday. She later added: “We’re going to need to partner throughout the West to tackle these issues. As you well know, wildfire knows no jurisdictional boundaries.”"}, {"title": "Dramatic Footage Captures Landslide That Collapsed Bridge, Killed 9 In India", "text": "A cellphone video caught the dramatic moment Sunday when rocks began to fall from a mountain slope in India’s Sangla Valley, triggering a deadly slide that killed at least eight tourists.The tourists, from Delhi, and their driver died when a boulder crashed into their minibus in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, The Indian Express reported.

(AP) — Flames racing through rugged terrain in Northern California destroyed multiple homes Saturday as the state’s largest wildfire intensified and numerous other blazes battered the U.S. West.The Dixie fire, which started July 14, had already leveled over a dozen houses and other structures when it tore through the tiny community of Indian Falls after dark.An updated damage estimate was not immediately available, though fire officials said the blaze has charred more than 181,000 acres (73,200 hectares) in Plumas and Butte counties and was 20% contained.The fire was burning in a remote area with limited access, hampering firefighters’ efforts as it charged eastward, fire officials said. It has prompted evacuation orders in several small communities and along the west shore of Lake Almanor, a popular area getaway.Meanwhile, the nation’s largest wildfire, southern Oregon’s Bootleg fire, was nearly halfway surrounded Saturday as more than 2,200 crew members worked to corral it in the heat and wind, fire officials said. The growth of the sprawling blaze had slowed, but thousands of homes remained threatened on its eastern side, authorities said.“This fire is resistant to stopping at dozer lines,” Jim Hanson, fire behavior analyst, said in a news release from the Oregon Department of Forestry. “With the critically dry weather and fuels we are experiencing, firefighters are having to constantly reevaluate their control lines and look for contingency options.”In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency for four northern counties because of wildfires that he said were causing “conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property.” The proclamation opened the way for more state support.Such conditions are often from a combination of unusual random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change. Global warming has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years.On Saturday, fire crews from California and Utah headed to Montana, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced. Five firefighters were injured Thursday when swirling winds blew flames back on them as they worked on the Devil’s Creek fire burning in rough, steep terrain near the rural town of Jordan, in the northeast part of the state.They remained hospitalized Friday. Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Mark Jacobsen declined to release the extent of their injuries, and attempts to learn their conditions Saturday were unsuccessful. Three of the firefighters are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crew members from North Dakota, and the other two are U.S. Forest Service firefighters from New Mexico.Another high-priority blaze, the Alder Creek fire in southwest Montana, had charred over 6,800 acres (2,750 hectares) and was 10% contained Saturday night. It was threatening nearly 240 homes.Elsewhere in California, the Tamarack fire south of Lake Tahoe continued to burn through timber and chaparral and threatened communities on both sides of the California-Nevada state line. The fire, sparked by lightning July 4 in Alpine County, has destroyed at least 10 buildings.Heavy smoke from that blaze and the Dixie fire lowered visibility and may at times ground aircraft providing support for fire crews. The air quality south of Lake Tahoe and across the state line into Nevada deteriorated to very unhealthy levels.In north-central Washington, firefighters battled two blazes in Okanogan County that threatened hundreds of homes and again caused hazardous air quality conditions Saturday. And in northern Idaho, east of Spokane, Washington, a small fire near the Silverwood Theme Park prompted evacuations Friday evening at the park and in the surrounding area. The theme park was back open on Saturday with the fire half contained.Although hot weather with afternoon winds posed a continued threat of spreading blazes, weekend forecasts also called for a chance of scattered thunderstorms in California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and other states. However, forecasters said some could be dry thunderstorms that produce little rain but a lot of lightning, which can spark new blazes.More than 85 large wildfires were burning around the country, most of them in Western states, and they had burned over 1.4 million acres (2,135 square miles, or more than 553,000 hectares)."}, {"title": "New Technology Propels Fight Against West Coast Wildfires", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — As drought- and wind-driven wildfires have become more dangerous across the American West in recent years, firefighters have tried to become smarter in how they prepare.They’re using new technology and better positioning of resources in a bid to keep small blazes from erupting into mega-fires like the ones that torched a record 4% of California last year, or the nation’s biggest wildfire this year that has charred a section of Oregon half the size of Rhode Island.There have been 730 more wildfires in California so far this year than last, an increase of about 16%. But nearly triple the area has burned — 470 square miles (1,200 square kilometers).Catching fires more quickly gives firefighters a better chance of keeping them small.That includes using new fire behavior computer modeling that can help assess risks before fires start, then project their path and growth.When “critical weather” is predicted — hot, dry winds or lightning storms — the technology, on top of hard-earned experience, allows California planners to pre-position fire engines, bulldozers, aircraft and hand crews armed with shovels and chain saws in areas where they can respond more quickly.With the computer modeling, “they can do a daily risk forecast across the state, so they use that for planning,” said Lynne Tolmachoff, spokeswoman for Cal Fire, California’s firefighting agency.That’s helped Cal Fire hold an average 95% of blazes to 10 acres (4 hectares) or less even in poor conditions driven by drought or climate change, she said. So far this year it’s held 96.5% of fires below 10 acres (4 hectares).Federal firefighters similarly track how dry vegetation has become in certain areas, then station crews and equipment ahead of lightning storms or in areas where people gather during holidays, said Stanton Florea, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.In another effort to catch fires quickly, what once were fire lookout towers staffed by humans have largely been replaced with cameras in remote areas, many of them in high-definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog. There are 800 such cameras scattered across California, Nevada and Oregon, and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time.Fire managers can then “start making tactical decisions based on what they can see,” even before firefighters reach the scene, Tolmachoff said.Fire managers also routinely summon military drones from the National Guard or Air Force to fly over fires at night, using heat imaging to map their boundaries and hot spots. They can use satellite imagery to plot the course of smoke and ash.“Your job is to manage the fire, and these are tools that will help you do so” with a degree of accuracy unheard of even five years ago, said Char Miller, a professor at Pomona College in California and a widely recognized wildfire policy expert.In California, fire managers can overlay all that information on high-quality Light Detection and Ranging topography maps that can aid decisions on forest management, infrastructure planning and preparation for wildfires, floods, tsunamis and landslides. Then they add the fire behavior computer simulation based on weather and other variables.Other mapping software can show active fires, fuel breaks designed to slow their spread, prescribed burns, defensible space cleared around homes, destroyed homes and other wildfire damage.“It’s all still new, but we can see where it’s going to take us in the future when it comes to planning for people building homes on the wildland area, but also wildland firefighting,” Tolmachoff said.Cal Fire and other fire agencies have been early adopters of remote imaging and other technologies that can be key in early wildfire detection, said John Bailey, a former firefighter and now professor at Oregon State University.Some experts argue it’s a losing battle against wildfires worsened by global warming, a century of reflexive wildfire suppression and overgrown forests, and communities creeping into what once were sparsely populated areas. Climate change has made the West hotter and drier in the past 30 years, and scientists have long warned the weather will get more extreme as the world warms.Yet, firefighters’ goal is to replicate the outcome of a fire that started Monday in the canyon community of Topanga, between Los Angeles and Malibu.It had the potential to swiftly spread through dry brush but was held to about 7 acres (3 hectares) after water-dropping aircraft were scrambled within minutes from LA and neighboring Ventura County.What firefighters don’t want is another wildfire like the one that ravaged the Malibu area in 2018. It destroyed more than 1,600 structures, killed three people and forced thousands to flee.In another bid to gain an early advantage, California is buying a dozen new Sikorsky Firehawk helicopters — at $24 million each — that can operate at night, fly faster, drop more water and carry more firefighters than the Vietnam War-era Bell UH-1H “Hueys” they will eventually replace.It will also soon receive seven military surplus C-130 transport aircraft retrofitted to carry 4,000 gallons (15,140 litres) of fire retardant, more than three times as much as Cal Fire’s workhorse S-2 airtankers.For all that, firefighters’ efforts to outsmart and suppress wildfires is counterproductive if all it does is postpone fires in areas that will eventually burn, argued Richard Minnich, a professor in Riverside who studies fire ecology.“No matter how sophisticated the technology may be, the areas they can manage or physically impact things is small,” he said. “We’re in over our heads. You can have all the technology in the world — fire control is impossible.”Working with wildfires is more realistic, he said, by taking advantage of patches that previously burned to channel the spread of new blazes.Timothy Ingalsbee, a former federal firefighter who now heads Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology, also said firefighters need to adopt a new approach when confronting the most dangerous wind-driven wildfires that leapfrog containment lines by showering flaming embers a mile or more ahead of the main inferno.It’s better to build more fire-resistant homes and devote scarce resources to protecting threatened communities while letting the fires burn around them, he said.“We have these amazing tools that allow us to map fire spread in real time and model it better than weather predictions,” Ingalsbee said. “Using that technology, we can start being more strategic and working with fire to keep people safe, keep homes safe, but let fire do the work it needs to do — which is recycle all the dead stuff into soil.”Associated Press writers Keith Ridler in Boise, Idaho, and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this story."}, {"title": "California Could Cut Off Water From Thousands Of Farmers In Historic Drought", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California regulators are planning to stop thousands of farmers from taking water out of the state’s major rivers and streams because of a worsening drought.The Sacramento Bee reported that the State Water Resources Control Board will vote on the “emergency curtailment” order Aug. 3. If approved, it would take effect about two weeks later. There would be exceptions for drinking water and other needs.The order shows the effect the drought is having on California’s water supply, said Eileen Sobeck, the board’s executive director. Sobeck told the newspaper that there “is just not enough to meet all of the legitimate demands.”“We don’t take this action lightly; we know that it’s going to impose hardships on folks,” she said.The western United States is in the midst of an historic drought that is emptying reservoirs and contributing to massive wildfires.Extreme conditions like these are often from a combination of unusual random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change. Scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years. Special calculations are needed to determine how much global warming is to blame, if at all, for a single extreme weather event.During the previous drought in the mid 2010s, state officials imposed restrictions on farmers, but stopped short of issuing a blanket order like this.California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked everyone to voluntarily cut their water use by 15%. He has issued an emergency drought proclamation that covers 50 of the state’s 58 counties, or about 42% of the state’s population. California’s population centers — including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco — are not included.Farmers’ water allocations this year have already been dramatically reduced. This new order will further weaken their ability to produce this year, said Karen Ross, secretary of of the state Department of Food and Agriculture.

Since then, the difficult mission to keep Toa safe and healthy has been marred by bad weather. Last week, a violent storm tore through the region, bringing massive swells, flooding and a sewage spill into the harbor.Toa had been staying in a sea-pen in the harbor but was moved to a 8,400-gallon seawater pool in the carpark of a local boating club for several days to protect him and his carers during the rough weather.He was successfully transferred back into his sea-pen Thursday night in an effort to help with injuries to his fins and an inflamed eye. He had also become more lethargic and stopped vocalizing as much as he had.“As soon as the calf was back in the sea, he started calling and zooming around the pen,” said Ian Angus, marine species manager for the DOC.“We remain focused on trying to find the orca calf’s pod. Our efforts will be focused on the lower half of the North Island and upper half of the South Island.”Toa’s primary caregiver is Ingrid Visser, the only person in the country with a doctorate in New Zealand orcas. She’s been with Toa since the start and has been monitoring him on site day and night while directing volunteers on how to help him, according to The Guardian.The DOC has opened up a tip line for people to report orca sightings anywhere in the country, given orcas can travel up to 100 miles a day.In a Wellington whale watch Facebook group, updates from locals, volunteers and tipsters appear almost hourly as people share images and videos of the little orca and desperately try to locate his family.However, as time drags on, experts have raised concern about his welfare.Karen Stockin, a marine biologist, told the NZ Herald that if Toa’s pod can’t be found, there are only two options: euthanasia or putting him into a purpose-built rehabilitation facility, which New Zealand does not have. Other experts have also raised concerns about his ability to reintegrate with his pod the more time he spends in human care."}, {"title": "Record Heat Fuels 'Unprecedented' Siberian Wildfires, Melting Permafrost", "text": "MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of wildfires engulf broad expanses of Russia each year, destroying forests and shrouding regions in acrid smoke.Northeastern Siberia has had particularly massive fires this summer amid record-setting heat. Many other regions across the vast country also have battled wildfires.Some factors behind Russia’s endemic wildfires and their consequences:In recent years, Russia has recorded high temperatures that many scientists regard as a clear result of climate change. The hot weather has caused permafrost to melt and fueled a growing number of fires.The vast Sakha-Yakutia region of Siberia has had a long spell of extremely hot and dry weather this summer, with temperatures reaching 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) and setting records for several days. The heat wave helped spark hundreds of fires, which so far have scorched more than 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of land, making it the worst-affected region in Russia.The fires have shrouded Yakutia’s cities, towns and villages in thick smoke, forcing authorities to briefly suspend flights at the regional capital’s airport. The Defense Ministry deployed transport planes and helicopters to help douse the flames.Fedot Tumusov, a member of the Russian parliament who represents the region, called the blazes “unprecedented” in their scope.The forests that cover huge areas of Russia make monitoring and quickly spotting new fires a daunting task.In 2007, a federal network to spot fires from aircraft was disbanded and had its assets turned over to regional authorities. The much-criticized change resulted in the program’s rapid deterioration.The government later reversed the move and reestablished the federal agency in charge of monitoring forests from the air. However, its resources remain limited, making it hard to survey the massive forests of Siberia and the Far East.While some wildfires are sparked by lightning, experts estimate that over 70% of them are caused by people, from carelessly discarding cigarettes to abandoned campfires, but there are other causes.Authorities regularly conduct controlled burns, setting a fire to clear the way for new vegetation or to deprive unplanned wildfires of fuel. Observers say such intentional burns often are poorly managed and sometimes trigger bigger blazes instead of containing them.Farmers also use the same technique to burn grass and small trees on agricultural lands. Such burns regularly get out of control.Activists and experts say that fires are often set deliberately to cover up evidence of illegal lumbering or to create new places for timber harvesting under the false pretext of clearing burned areas.Activists in Siberia and the Far East allege such arson is driven by strong demand for timber in the colossal Chinese market, and they have called for a total ban on timber exports to China.Officials have acknowledged the problem and pledged to tighten oversight, but Russia’s far-flung territory and regulatory loopholes make it hard to halt the illegal activity.Critics blame the 2007 forest code that gave control over timberlands to regional authorities and businesses, eroding centralized monitoring, fueling corruption and contributing to illegal tree-cutting practices that help spawn fires.Russian law allows authorities to let wildfires burn in certain areas if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them.Critics have long assailed the provision, arguing it encourages inaction by authorities and slows firefighting efforts so a blaze that could have been extinguished at a relatively small cost is often allowed to burn uncontrolled.“They eventually have to extinguish it anyway, but the damage and the costs are incomparable,” said Mikhail Kreindlin of Greenpeace Russia.In addition to destroying trees, wildfires also kill wildlife and pose a threat to human health by polluting the air."}, {"title": "The Best And Worst Vegetarian Meat Substitutes For The Environment", "text": "In an effort to protect the environment, many of us have started whipping up a tofu stir fry on the regular and chowing down on the popular Impossible Burger in place of a traditional beef hamburger patty.You’re on the right track if you’re doing this. Environmental experts agree that eating any type of meat substitute is, without a doubt, better for the environment than meat.“The single biggest step that will significantly reduce our environmental impact of the food we eat and grow is to ensure that we consume more plant-based proteins within our diets,” Mark Driscoll, a sustainability expert and founder of the consultancy Tasting the Future, told HuffPost. “Our food system contributes up to 34% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions, uses 70% of all freshwater and has been the main driver behind the loss of 60% of our biodiversity over the last 40 years. Conversion of protein from feed crops into animal protein for human consumption is inherently resource-inefficient.”That being said, there are a lot of meat substitutes on the market. There’s tofu, which can be easily ground up and made into a burger patty, and newer, trendier Impossible and Beyond Meats. In other words, we have options. But when it comes to the environment, these options are not all created equal.We had sustainability experts grade the most popular meat alternatives. One thing to keep in mind as you go through the grades: A “C” for a plant-based product is still better for the environment than the best industrially-farmed animal meat, the experts said.Lentils and black beans are commonly used as a base for veggie burgers. If you like the flavor, you’re in luck, because choosing beans as your protein source is a great decision from an environmental standpoint.“Using beans, lentils and other legumes in burgers is about as environmentally friendly as you can get,” Isaac Emery, founder and principal consultant at Informed Sustainability Consulting, said. “Legumes need much less fertilizer than other crops and don’t need to be processed.”Driscoll echoed this, saying that beans are “undoubtedly the stars of the show. This is particularly true if grown organically,” he said. “With high levels of protein and fiber, they are legumes and therefore add nitrogen back to soils and contribute to soil health.”A tropical tree fruit, jackfruit is relatively sustainable as long as pesticides and herbicides are not used, according to Driscoll. “The trees do not require irrigation and it’s a shade crop that can be intergrown with other crops to create a regenerative ecosystem,” he explained. “Trees grown in silvicultural systems mean that carbon is extracted from the atmosphere, so there is some impact from emissions as a result of transportation.”Because seitan is derived from wheat, its sustainability depends on the way it’s grown, Driscoll explained. “A lot of wheat is grown using a mix of agrochemicals and pesticides. which can contaminate watercourses and damage biodiversity and insect pollinators,” he said.Emery is a bigger fan of seitan, saying the fact that farmers can grow winter wheat and spring wheat on the same field in one year makes it a good use of land.Tofu is made from soya, or soy. The demand for soy has been linked with deforestation, according to the World Wildlife Foundation, as it can generate greenhouse gas emissions without the proper practice. Soy production tends to use a significant amount of water and pesticides, according to Driscoll, hence its not-so-stellar grade.While not terrible for the environment, tempeh, a meat substitute made of fermented soybeans, isn’t super sustainable because the fertilizer it’s grown in often contains pesticides. “Transportation adds to the carbon footprint too,” Driscoll said.Popular as they may be, Impossible products rank low on the list of meat substitutes from a sustainability standpoint. “They are undoubtedly better for the environment than beef,” Driscoll noted. “These products use significantly less water, land and fossil fuel emissions than beef.”That being said, soy is a key ingredient of Impossible products, in particular. “Unless soy is produced using organic systems, soy can use significant quantities of pesticides,” Driscoll said.Note: Beyond Meat products, on the other hand, are made with pea protein instead of soy, earning a slightly higher ranking.A reason people love these products so much is that they mimic the texture of animal meat, Emery pointed out. But getting that texture means more processing. “That means their environmental footprint is tied to the environmental footprint of energy, and not just farming,” he said. “As our energy system gets more environmentally friendly, so will these products.”Sure, some of these plant-based meat substitutes are better than others. But the most important thing to keep in mind is that by foregoing meat, you’re doing the environment a big favor."}, {"title": "Gut-Wrenching Photo Shows Mother Bear Standing Over Cub Killed By Car In Yosemite", "text": "Yosemite National Park shared a heartbreaking story from a ranger that illustrates the deadly consequences of driving recklessly or too fast in the park.“We get this call a lot,” begins the now-viral post, shared on the park’s social media accounts on Friday. “Too much, to be honest. ‘Bear hit by vehicle, dead on the side of the road.’ Sadly, it’s become routine.”The bear turned out to be a cub around 6 months old. The ranger, whose name is not given, carries the cub away from the road to a grassy spot. The ranger notes the cub is female, which “immediately triggers thoughts of the life this bear may have lived ― perhaps she would have had cubs of her own.”It’s then that the already emotional post takes a truly gut-wrenching turn. The ranger hears a stick snap and sees another bear nearby. At first, the ranger thinks maybe the bear is scavenging or is possibly also trying to cross the road.“But then I hear it, and it changes my mind completely,” the ranger wrote. “From behind me there’s a deep toned but soft sounding grunt. I immediately know what it is. It’s a vocalization, the kind sows (female bears) make to call to their cubs.”The meaning is clear: “This bear is the mom, and she never left her cub.”“The calls to the cub continue, sounding more pained each time,” the post reads. “I glance back finding myself hoping it would respond to her call too, but of course, nothing.

Just 32% of the fire is contained.The fire is so large that it’s spawning pyrocumulous clouds, super-heated columns of smoke and ash that can reach up to 6 miles high and generate their own lightning and strong winds. Those, in turn, can ignite and spread other fires, creating a destructive cycle.“Normally, the weather predicts what the fire will do,” Oregon Department of Forestry spokesperson Marcus Kauffman told CNN on Tuesday. “In this case, the fire is predicting what the weather will do.”Fire officials said Wednesday that lightning or some other natural cause likely ignited the massive fire on July 6, which expanded aggressively thanks to a combination of gusty winds and critically dry fuel.

We had unprecedented wildfires.”“It’s incredibly important that we ... tackle climate change, from reducing our reliance on fossil fuels to making sure that we transition to clean energy as quickly as possible,” Brown added.Almost 80 large fires are currently burning across the American West.

(AP) — A couple whose gender reveal ceremony sparked a Southern California wildfire that killed a firefighter last year were charged with involuntary manslaughter, authorities announced Tuesday.Refugio Manuel Jimenez Jr. and Angela Renee Jimenez pleaded not guilty Monday to charges involving the El Dorado Fire, San Bernardino County District Attorney Jason Anderson announced at a news conference.The charges included one felony count of involuntary manslaughter, along with other felony and misdemeanor counts related to the fire.The El Dorado Fire erupted on Sept. 5 when the couple and their young children staged a baby gender reveal at El Dorado Ranch Park in Yucaipa, at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains.A smoke-generating pyrotechnic device was set off in a field and quickly ignited dry grass on a scorching day. The couple frantically tried to use bottled water to douse the flames and called 911, authorities said.Strong winds stoked the fire as it ran through wilderness on national forest land, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Los Angeles.Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.On Sept. 17, flames overran a remote area where firefighters were cutting fire breaks, killing Charles Morton, the 39-year-old leader of the elite Big Bear Interagency Hotshot Squad. Morton had worked as a firefighter for 18 years, mostly with the U.S. Forest Service.The blaze injured 13 other people and forced the evacuations of hundreds of residents in small communities in the San Bernardino National Forest area. It destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings.The blaze blackened nearly 36 square miles (92 square kilometers) of land in San Bernardino and Riverside counties before it was contained on Nov. 16.The fire was one of thousands during a record-breaking wildfire season in California that charred more than 4% of the state while destroying nearly 10,500 buildings and killing 33 people.The couple were released on their own recognizance pending a Sept. 15 court date."}, {"title": "Dramatic Videos Show Deadly Flooding In China", "text": "Dramatic videos posted to social media captured people trapped in subways and cars floating down the street as floods tore through China’s Henan province.After heavy rain drenched the city of Zhengzhou in central China on Tuesday, at least a dozen people have been reported dead, according to The Associated Press.Videos showed people standing in chest-high water inside the subway.Other footage captured cars floating down the street, carried by muddy waters.People were filmed rescuing fellow residents trapped by the torrential floods.Over 100,000 people have been evacuated across the region, according to state-affiliated news media CGTN.The local government in Zhengzhou said that the “flood control situation is grim” and that the risk of disaster was “extremely high” in a statement on its website, per NBC News.This was just the latest in a number of natural disasters around the world in recent weeks that illustrate the deadly consequences of climate change: Catastrophic floods in Germany last week killed over 140 people, hundreds died after a heat wave blanketed the Pacific Northwest earlier this month, and the Bootleg wildfire currently burning in Oregon is so large it is creating its own dramatic weather patterns."}, {"title": "California Utility Company Says Its Equipment May Have Caused Fire", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pacific Gas & Electric equipment may have been involved in the start of the big Dixie Fire burning in the Sierra Nevada, the nation’s largest utility reported to California regulators.PG&E said in a report Sunday to the California Public Utilities Commission that a repair man responding to a circuit outage on July 13 spotted blown fuses in a conductor atop a pole, a tree leaning into the conductor and fire at the base of the tree.The Dixie Fire has grown to nearly 47 square miles (122 square kilometers), largely in remote wilderness.

It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said.A notice posted Saturday on the 103-mile (165-kilometer) Death Ride’s website said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all bike riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers and spectators stranded in the small town and racing to get out.Kelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire’s quick spread.“It happened so fast,” Pennington said. “We left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.”About 500 fire personnel were battling the flames Sunday, “focusing on preserving life and property with point protection of structures and putting in containment lines where possible,” the U.S. Forest Service said.Meteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California and southern Oregon.“With the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,” the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter.Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight.

The wildfire, near the 2018 site of the deadliest U.S. blaze in recent memory, was 15% contained and covered 39 square miles. The fire is northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the new blaze burned.Officials in Montana identified a firefighter who was seriously burned when flames overtook a crew fighting a small blaze there. Dan Steffensen was flown to a Salt Lake City hospital after the winds shifted suddenly on Friday, engulfing his fire engine near the Wyoming border.

The catastrophes have brought a mounting death toll and incalculable trauma.But, for the first time in over a decade, the U.S. government may actually do something about the emissions destabilizing the climate.This week, the Biden administration and its allies in Congress announced plans to pack the federal budget with resources and rules that could jolt a country long paralyzed by corporate obstruction and science denial into finally confronting an unprecedented crisis.Democrats plan to use their slim majorities in Congress to pass a $3.5 trillion spending package that includes mandates to cut 80% of planet-heating pollution from the electricity sector by 2030, fund a new green jobs corps, and make it easier for drivers to swap gas guzzlers for electric vehicles.Whether enough funding will make it into the final budget to make the programs significant remains unclear. By tacking the proposals to the budget process, which requires only 51 votes to become law, Democrats can circumvent the 60-vote threshold for passing traditional legislation that grants Republicans filibuster power.But doing so gives Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), widely considered the most conservative Democrat in the caucus, kingmaker status, and already he’s signaled his opposition to anything that disadvantages fossil fuels.There’s pull on the other end of Democrats’ ideological spectrum, too, as 16 senators, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), have vowed to vote against any budget that excludes climate provisions. But, as Mother Jones reported, those in the “No Climate, No Deal” contingent have yet to settle on any uniform demands about what kinds of policy they want to see in the budget.“We cannot address a small sliver of our carbon pollution and call it a victory. We have to tackle this problem at scale,” Leah Stokes, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of ”Short Circuiting Policy,” wrote in The Atlantic this week. “The last chance we had for a federal climate bill was 12 years ago. I’m afraid that Congress will again fail to pass climate legislation that invests at the necessary level. I’m worried that we’ll keep burning time we no longer have.”While negotiators hash out the budget, other lawmakers are proposing standalone legislation that could ultimately appear in the final funding bill.The Senate Energy Committee approved Manchin’s bill directing $95 billion to carbon capture and storage technology in fossil fuel plants on Wednesday.Progressives in the House of Representatives, meanwhile, are pitching their own vision for how to legislate on climate.In March, lawmakers announced the THRIVE Act, a $10 trillion spending plan, their banner policy.The steeper price tags the left-leaning candidates are seeking may seem big. But the numbers are actually more in line with what economists on the left and right ― from the progressive Roosevelt Institute to George W. Bush-era Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ― say is needed to rapidly scale down the U.S. output of planet-heating gases.Yet President Joe Biden and his treasury chief, Janet Yellen, worry that borrowing more money to justify climate spending poses financial risks for the country, despite warnings from economists and forecasters that failing to invest enough now in decarbonization carries even bigger risks as warming worsens. Under those self-imposed restraints, the White House sought to offset all its infrastructure and climate spending with new taxes.Facing ferocious blowback from industries and their allies in Congress, the federal policymakers could only come up with $2.4 trillion in direct revenue to offset the program and managed to muster another $1.1 trillion through accounting techniques with the budget.And while the Biden administration has faced mounting protests from climate activists demanding more action to curb emissions, pleas for something as wonky as “more deficit spending” have yet to materialize or gain popularity.Despite far stricter budget constraints due to its multinational euro currency, the European Union this week took some even more aggressive climate steps, proposing a dozen bills that would, among other things, ban diesel- and gas-powered cars by 2035 and levy new taxes on heating gas.Expanding on those efforts could prove crucial ahead of November’s United Nations climate conference in Scotland. The world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than in pre-industrial times, and even if every country adheres to its pledged emissions cuts, the planet would still be on pace to warm by at least another 2 degrees this century. Changing that trajectory depends not only on rich nations cutting emissions, but on poorer countries doing the same, and in many cases forswearing the development of heavily polluting industries that helped North America and Europe grow so wealthy.If the U.S. and European Union — home to the people most responsible for the accumulated carbon in the atmosphere today — can’t rapidly slash emissions, convincing the majority of humanity in Africa, Asia and Latin America to do the same will be a tough sell."}, {"title": "Scientists Fear For Birds As Utah's Great Salt Lake Nears Record Low Levels", "text": "Utah’s shrinking Great Salt Lake could spell disaster for millions of birds that depend on the briny body of water for food.North America’s largest saltwater lake has been diminishing for years due to people redirecting its water for human use. Climate change-fueled drought ― including the extreme drought currently hammering the western United States ― has made it more severe.The southern part of the lake is “just a couple inches above the historic low measurement taken in 1963,” according to a Friday statement from the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency said it anticipates the water will continue to drop over the next several months.A comprehensive history of the lake from The Deseret News earlier this year noted that while the size of the lake has “always fluctuated,” an 11-foot drop in water levels ― which is a lot for the wide lake’s relatively shallow lake bed ― has occurred mostly over the last 10 years.“Twenty years ago, this was under about 10 feet of water,” Kevin Perry, chairman of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, told CNN. As he said that, he was riding a bike across the dry lake bed.The lake is an important food source for an estimated 10 million migrating birds, according to a statement this week from the Utah Geological Survey. Those birds eat the lake’s brine shrimp and brine flies that, in turn, feed off of underwater reeflike rock mounds, called microbialites, that are created by microbes.Receding water levels can expose the microbialites and threaten the lake’s entire ecosystem, the UGS warned. In the coming months, “a very significant proportion” are expected to be exposed, according to the agency.The brine shrimp also play an important economic role for people, who harvest the creatures and sell them as fish food.The lake is also an essential breeding habitat for pelicans. Dipping water levels have resulted in new land bridges being exposed between the mainland and the island where the birds nest, The Associated Press reported. Larger animals like foxes and coyotes can then cross to the island, which scares pelican parents away. The eggs and young are then vulnerable to being preyed on by seagulls.Human health is also at risk. The lake bed soil is high in arsenic, and when water recedes and the ground dries out, wind blows that dust into the air. While the lake bed has a protective crust that prevents a lot of dust from getting into the area, that crust is getting damaged as people walk and even drive vehicles on it.“The more continued drought we have, the more of the salt crust will be weathered and more dust will become airborne because there’s less of that protective crust layer,” Laura Vernon of Friends of the Great Salt Lake told the AP.Wildlife biologist Jaimi Butler told CNN that thinking about keeping water in the Great Salt Lake is the “biggest thing” that keeps her up at night.“We’re on the doorstep of a catastrophe,” she said."}, {"title": "'Embarrassed' Looking Raccoon Hauled Out Of Home After Failed Snack Quest", "text": "A photo of a raccoon being rescued after breaking into a Georgia home is going viral ― despite the raccoon’s apparent best efforts to hide.“We were called out to help this guy find his way back out of a house in Dalton Monday night,” the City of Dalton Fire Department wrote in a Wednesday Facebook post. “As you can tell, he was pretty embarrassed about it, but it’s really nothing to be ashamed of. We all need a helping hand every now and then.”The photo shows a raccoon covering his eyes with a paw while a firefighter carries him through the kitchen. (The department noted in a comment that the firefighter did not stage the raccoon’s position or manipulate his arms or paws.)The raccoon was more likely scared than actually “embarrassed.” Raccoons tend to cover their eyes when they’re afraid, according to Tennessee wildlife rescue For Fox Sake.Luckily, this raccoon’s frightening ordeal didn’t last for long.

But a vast stretch of the huge cracked and dried lake bed in the central province of Konya is now an animal killing field.Environmental activists have pleaded with the government to do more to protect the lake’s wildlife in the face of the deadly drought. A canal that usually feeds the shallow lake has been redirected instead to farmers, who have been accused of wasting tremendous amounts of water with inefficient irrigation.“This is the irrigation canal that comes from Konya.

Here's How It's Changing How I See The World.", "text": "It’s not the ’60s and I’m not a hippie. Neither am I in my experimental teens or 20s. Yet here I am: a mom on mushrooms. Not the cremini I put in my morning omelette or the dried shiitakes I rehydrate in warm water before adding to fresh ramen, but exactly the kind of mushrooms we all know as “magic.”How, exactly, does a modern mom, between work and carpools and book clubs, get her hands on magic mushrooms? That’s an interesting question, but there’s a more important one before it: Where does a modern mother get the idea she wants to get her hands on magic mushrooms?Because drugs, especially psychedelics, have never been my jam. Sure, I’ve passed around a sketchily-sourced joint on the deck outside a high school party. I was also quick to disappear without goodbyes, wandering down the street back home — my brain at 17 already overactive enough not to need my teenaged paranoias exaggerated.And there were those repeated late ’80s “Public Service Announcements” on TV with that guy with the rolled-up sleeves and bad-cop act, holding a hot cast iron pan, cracking an egg with one hand like a head on cement, leaving viewers with a death stare and the hot snap and sizzle of “your brains on drugs.” I was a rule-follower by nature, and these images left their impressions.So why now? Why, at 44, am I regularly waking up and taking a mid-morning nibble off a stem of Psilocybe cyanescens? My first impulse is to blame Michael Pollan and his book “How To Change Your Mind,” because only a science nerd could have led me to the dark side. But if I’m being honest, the “dark side” was always my favorite side, and it’s just taken me 44 years to come to terms with that.Dark, I’d argue, gets an undeserved bad rap. I would go so far as to argue that human society is obsessed, even, with some real bullshit positive psychology — but that’s another essay. When I say “dark side” I mean, for example, the dreams into which we venture every night and then entirely neglect by the light of day. I mean the night sky in which we occupy a single planet of eight around a sun, belonging to a solar system beyond which there might be — according to astronomers — billions of worlds. I am talking about the undiscussed darkness of our impossible existence — and why.Not that it isn’t our first instinct to ask these questions. I field them every day from my children:“Mom, who had the very first baby?” my daughter asks.“Mom, what happens when you die?” my son wants to know.“Mom, what do YOU think God is?” they inquire as they roll their forks in spaghetti on the kitchen island.These questions seem, to me, the most important in our one-of-billions world, and yet I cannot figure out why my 5- and 8-year old children are the only people I know entertaining them. Except that we are always in a rush, and I am just as guilty of pushing these questions aside.Because these questions require me to stop chopping carrots and stop feeding the dog and stop looking at my phone for texts from my husband as to when he’s coming home. These questions require a blanket and a couch or maybe a hammock or a sleeping bag under a night sky. These questions require the extension, trust, and embrace of my full imagination. My quickest cop-out with the kids? “No one really knows love.” And then I keep on chopping carrots.Slowing down might be the very point of my magic mushroom stem-nibbling. And let me be clear, I’m pretty sure “nibbling stems” is a very unprofessional methodology. I started hearing about microdosing, or taking very small doses of a drug or substance, around the same time psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) became decriminalized around Colorado and legalized in Oregon.I have friends on both ends of therapy (treating and receiving) who chatter excitedly about the early trials showing psilocybin’s symptom relief for depression and anxiety. I’ve even heard of a local girl who does things “properly.” She encapsulates the mushrooms according to precise calculations with precise devices and then organizes very-gentle “guided experiences” for novice experimenters like me. But as I have worked as an experiential education guide for over 16 years, I am entirely sick of guided experiences. So I continue to nibble the psilocybin in my own soft rebellion.Now, if you are one of those people who pulls over their car when my 8-year-old walks the six blocks between my husband’s office and our house to ask, “Where is your mother?!” then let me assure you, I am not actually tripping on these mushrooms. And though the noticeable immediate effect is for me less than a cup of caffeinated coffee (which I do not drink because it makes me shaky and sleepless), I reserve my nibbles for the slow days after the kids have left for school, when I have hours to drop into my writing (which I feel the psilocybin serves).The goal of microdosing, after all, is not to trip. It’s difficult to define either the exact effects or goals of microdosing psilocybin because the science is still in progress. Researchers have taken up the task only in the last 10 years, and the results aren’t all in.A microdosage is generally considered “subtherapeutic,” with no adverse side effects. But anecdotal accounts are showing there may be a cellular response that affects mood and health in similar ways as larger dosages (for which there is plenty of science with startling results). But in my entire psilocybin career, including the last six months I have been regularly microdosing, I have experienced no hallucinogenic effects. (Not yet anyway. Because a macrodose is, in fact, my long-term plan.) But if I have learned anything in my 44 years, it’s to slow down.So what is my goal? My goal was inspired by the subtitle in Chapter 6 of Pollan’s book, “Dying.”Under this title, Pollan writes about cancer patients who use psilocybin (in hallucinogenic dosages) to psychedelically approach impending death. And according to preliminary studies, it works: “In both the NYU and Hopkins trials, some 80% of cancer patients showed clinically significant reductions in standard measures of anxiety and depression.”So here’s what I’m wondering: If cancer patients can make peace with their own deaths, can I approach my existential distress about the impending sixth mass extinction on Earth in a similar way? What would happen if I could look deeply into the eyes of my own extinction? Is there a realm where I can make some peace with the quality and quantity of the human years my children and their descendants face in the oncoming climate crisis?If you do not have a child, please imagine for a minute going to bed with this elephant weight on your chest each night. Because this is how it is for me every night: I tuck my daughter in and she closes her eyes and smiles because she thinks she knows peace. And with her eyes closed, with the blankets pulled up to her chin, I think: What have I done. What have we done? This future coming at her... and I don’t know if it’s worth living.I don’t know where my daughter’s instinct to become a mother came from (because it was not mine as a child), but she repeatedly says that of all the things she hopes for her future, she wants “to be a mama.” How and when will I tell her the Earth is not stable and already overtasked by the number of humans that live it on it?I know she feels the peace shifting. She felt a tremor in the plumes of black smoke from wildfires she watched burn from the roof of our house last fall. She felt tremors in the cancellation of her 5th birthday because of a global pandemic that has killed 3.8 million and counting.And then there are the tremors she feels through me. The shift of Colorado weather to “new normal” permanent drought. The tenuous future of the avocados and raspberries that she favors, threatened by hive collapses of the bees that pollinate the fruits. Her mother’s tears for the songbirds that fell out of the sky in their migration south last fall. Yellow warblers and violet-green swallows and flycatchers with bold wing bars that fell dead in starvation by the thousands. They fell in Arizona after their flight across Colorado skies. My daughter’s skies.I recently received my newest batch of mushrooms from a trusted friend of a trusted friend who grows them for therapeutic purposes in Oregon. My husband wanted to crush and encapsulate the cluster, but I would not let him touch them. It’s literally a family of mushrooms: An impossibly large grandmother mushroom three inches in height with her wavy umbrella cap reaching over and protecting 13 or more smaller stems and caps, all of varying heights and bendy stems. This family of stalks shares a porous root system — which I am unsure is even edible.My current microdosing method is to pull off a mushroom, after asking for permission from the fungus, of course (because I was born with that bit of hippie-ness), and nibble the stalk. I like to think we — me and the little forest — have already established a kinship because I love their smell like the pheromones of a first crush: woody with a touch of sweetness and a powdery nuance. I remember kids in high school choking their mushrooms down or cringing over infused mushroom tea, but that has not been my experience. Maybe it is my adult palette or my adult intentions, but I savor my nibbles.I begin with my incisors, pass the little morsel around my mouth, grind it with my molars to take in the deeper flavors on the back of my tongue, and swallow. Then I go about my day. The effect, for me, is so subtle I often forget my nibble entirely except ― except ― when I notice a shimmer in the tall bluestem grasses laced with snow on my hike. Or suddenly hear, at once, all the calls of wintering birds across my path. Or catch myself watching a black-capped chickadee hopping from branch to branch of a blue spruce for five minutes before I snap from the spell. Or notice a pattern or swirl in my prose that I wonder if I’d have seen otherwise.When these little things sparkle at me, I’m not hallucinating. I’m just seeing the world. And I suspect the insights, the new neural pathways forming in my brain, are also healing me out of some anxiety ruts.Since I’ve begun nibbling, the highest frequencies of my existential fears have subsided. And though I do not know if this is normal, I often, in the day after a nibble, experience the briefest flash of alignment. In that second, I do not feel sad or overwhelmed or angry or alone or impossible. In that second, I am at once forgiver and forgiven. The flash ― it’s gone as quick as it came. But it leaves a faint footprint — like a snowshoe hare on snow.Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris, head of the psychedelic research group at Imperial College London, likened the effects of psychedelics on the brain to shaking a snow globe: “you shake it and there’s disorder there. But then the snow will settle again.” He explains that a brain that has fallen into pathological patterns can benefit from reorganization.It’s those new paths I’m after. A rite of passage. Not a rite that folds me further into human culture, but a passage that folds me into nature. A sacrament. A spiritually significant experience — the way Indigenous peoples of Central American and Mexico have been using psilocybin for centuries.I’m not advocating drugs, per se. “Do not do them,” I say (with my sleeves rolled up), if that needs to be said. What I’m advocating is a seismic shift in what we hold meaningful, a conscious exploration of the dark that surrounds us, and an embrace of anything that gets us closer to our nature as nature.I have, in my study of psilocybin, learned many new words. Other names for psychedelics include entactogen (“touching within”), empathogen (“generating a state of empathy”), and my favorite: entheogen (”that which causes God to be experienced”). I do not think psilocybin is the only method to achieve these effects, but I do think our neural ruts, chafed by lifetimes of capitalistic conditioning, are in need of a seismic shake.One NYU study volunteer said of her psychedelic experience, “It is like I know another language,” and I have a feeling that as a species out of touch, out of empathetic connection, out of mystical alignment with all other species on this planet — that a new language might be exactly what we need.Carl Jung wrote, “The afternoon of life is just as full of meaning as the morning.” I read in this that the search for meaning is important when we are young and accumulating experience, but just as ripe, as necessary and needed, when we are older.I would argue that the search for meaning is even more essential, more expedited in pressing need, in the face of the impending ecological death we will witness in the next five, 10, 20, 50 years. Jung went further and concluded that we are meant to do things in the last half of life for ourselves, for society, for the sake of our souls.Jung’s afternoon light feels collectively upon us right now.As the kids opened the door to leave for school today, I noticed the entire world shimmering behind them. I was not under the influence of any psilocybin. It was this rare occurrence I hypothesize happens more in Colorado than anywhere else because it was sunny and snowing. The sky was that shock of blue that happens only in dry high altitude where nothing muddles color or distance. And yet, it was snowing. Large flakes, blowing, I suspected, from some black sheep cloud maybe hiding behind the house. I went out on the deck, stood under the falling cubic crystals, and looked for the cloud, but could find no source.The effect of snowflakes in sunshine, if you have not seen it, is something to behold. Imagine every angle of an ice crystal reflecting that blazing largest star in our solar system. And then multiply it by billions. The effect is dazzling. I went inside and steeped my tea without taking my eyes off the window, and then I sat and I watched.It felt like the first time I had sat down since becoming a mother. And it made me wonder if I could, in fact, hold it all. Light and dark, grief and gratitude, sun and snow. I came up with no answer. I just wondered.Christina Rivera Cogswell is a writer from Colorado. Her work can be found at Catapult, Bat City Review, Beautiful Things at River Teeth Journal, and elsewhere.

The complaints reveal workers around the state feared for their lives as they clocked in amid temperatures as high as 116 degrees, often without sufficient breaks, water or air conditioning. The complaints came from workplaces of all kinds: restaurants, retail stores, car washes, warehouses, construction sites and manufacturing facilities.The records offer a frightening glimpse of the dangers workers across the country will face as heat waves become more frequent and extreme due to global warming. The conditions can be even more hazardous in mild climates like Oregon, where many workplaces aren’t necessarily outfitted for high heat.Dozens complained of busted air conditioning units that employers hadn’t fixed. Many said they were required to continue working even when it felt unsafe. Some said they were reprimanded for taking unauthorized breaks in cooler areas of their worksites.The names of complainants were redacted. Although anyone can submit a complaint to OSHA, most appear to have come from employees as opposed to members of the public. In most cases, investigators would not have determined yet whether an employer violated the law.The hazards were so prevalent that on July 8 Oregon OSHA implemented an emergency heat rule requiring employers to provide access to water, shade and adequate breaks during severe weather, as well as training on heat stress. The state is working on crafting a permanent rule.The fast-food industry drew a large share of the complaints. Pleas for help poured in from McDonald’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, Jack in the Box, Carl’s Jr., Subway and Chipotle locations. Again and again, restaurant workers said they were forced to work in scorching-hot kitchens without adequate air conditioning, according to the hazard descriptions in the complaints.From a Pizza Hut:Extremely hot inside. Employees are being made to work near ovens and wearing masks without air-conditioning working inside the building. It’s extremely dangerous. No modifications are being made to mitigate the high potential for the heat exhaustion.From a Starbucks:The air conditioning is not working. Employees are exposed to extreme heat conditions and have been experiencing heat related illness symptoms. The business does not have fans, employees are not given extra breaks or a cool place to rest.From a Carl’s Jr.:The restaurant management is forcing employees to work without air-conditioning in dangerous heat. The temperature in the building is at least 100*F. Employees are covered in sweat, and are showing signs of heat exhaustion.From a Burger King:Employees are working in 100 degree or higher heat with no air conditioner in a hot humidity kitchen for two years. In the past, employees have fainted from working in this kind of heat and employees can’t call out if they feel they aren’t able to work.From another Burger King:110+ Degrees in the kitchen over the past few days. The AC system is broken and the employer will not fix it. This is when it’s been 101+ outside. Employees are forced to work nonetheless, no matter the heat hazard.From a Chipotle:Thermostat for AC not working and had requested to have this fixed previously and management did not address it.Plenty of workers wondered why their restaurants were still open while they seemed so ill-equipped to handle such weather. One complaint alleged that management at a pub in Wilsonville threatened to fire anyone who left because of the heat. The complaint claimed the temperature was above 90 degrees in the dining area and above 110 degrees in the kitchen: “They eventually closed but not until someone from the public complained and threatened to make a complaint.”One complaint alleged that there was no air conditioning inside a Portland restaurant, leading to temperatures above 90 degrees. Workers ended up retreating to the walk-in refrigerator for relief.“But the manager locked the door to keep employees from using the only way that was available for them to cool off,” the complaint states.Workers at another Portland restaurant apparently pleaded with managers to close, to no avail: “Many employees almost passed out, and begged the management to close the restaurant, but they were told that the company doesn’t want to lose money.”At a Eugene restaurant, a complainant reported that “the entire kitchen staff (10-15 people) are feeling ill and exhausted from multiple days working in these extremely hot conditions.”HuffPost readers: Have you endured extreme heat at work? We’d like to hear from you. Email our reporter here.One worker said a temperature of 95 degrees was recorded near the fryer inside a doughnut shop in Portland, even though the air conditioning was running: “Some employees reported feeling ill from the heat. Symptoms included headache, nausea, bloody nose, and feeling foggy.”Some parts of the store were cooler than others: “The break room and yeasting area [were] closer to 85 degrees.”That’s much cooler than the conditions detailed at a greenhouse in McMinnville. A complaint alleged it was 20 degrees hotter inside the greenhouse than outside, and that workers weren’t getting enough breaks:“No fans inside the greenhouse. The employer is not providing a place for employees to cool down. The employees asked management if they could come in early so they could leave early to avoid the heat and were denied.”Someone from a cannabis dispensary said it was 104 degrees inside their facility. “No air conditioning in a black building,” the complaint reads.A complaint against a car wash in Scappoose alleged that one worker ended up sick with heat exhaustion. “The employer did not respond to employees who tried to bring this problem to his attention,” the complaint reads.Multiple complaints were filed against a canvassing agency that raises funds for nonprofits. The complaints said workers were going door-to-door or soliciting on the street with little access to shade. It’s not clear if all the complaints came from the same person.“Canvasser looked exhausted and chapped and had ran out of drinking water and did not know where to get more,” one stated. “The canvasser did not know how to identify the signs of heat stroke.”Someone reported to OSHA that dancers at a Portland gay club were “prone to heat exhaustion, dehydration, and potentially heatstroke” in the poorly ventilated basement where they got changed.Factories and warehouses also turned up frequently in the files. One complainant said a worker at a Portland food manufacturer fainted due to heat exhaustion. The air conditioning was inadequate, they wrote, especially near the ovens: “Temperatures can be 10 to 20 degrees warmer on [the] floor than outside.”A complaint against a warehouse said that workers were struggling to carry out basic tasks, and that the facility was too large for workers to easily step outside for fresh air: “Employees are said to be passing out and dropping things due to the heat.” A complaint against another warehouse said only the break room had air conditioning, but when workers tried to take advantage of it, “they are being reprimanded by the manager.”As if the record-breaking temperatures weren’t enough, some workers were apparently concerned about another byproduct of climate change: increased wildfires. One complaint alleged that roofing and sheet metal workers on a job site in Klamath Falls were working in triple-digit heat while the Tennant and Lava fires burned over the state line in California. They were worried about poor air quality on top of heat stress.“Little to no shade and no breaks for a long period of time,” the complaint said."}, {"title": "Death Toll Over 110, Dozens Missing After Devastating Floods In Europe", "text": "BERLIN (AP) — At least 110 people have died in devastating floods across parts of western Germany and Belgium, officials said Friday, as rescue operations and the search for hundreds still unaccounted for continued.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he was “stunned” by the devastation caused by the flooding and pledged support to the families of those killed and to cities and towns facing significant damage.“In the hour of need, our country stands together,” Steinmeier said in a statement Friday afternoon. “It’s important that we show solidarity for those from whom the flood has taken everything.”Authorities in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate said 60 people had died there, including at least nine residents of an assisted living facility for people with disabilities. In neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia state officials put the death toll at 43, but warned that the figure could rise further.Rescuers were rushing Friday to help people trapped in their homes in the town of Erftstadt, southwest of Cologne. Regional authorities said several people had died after their houses collapsed due to subsidence, and aerial pictures showed what appeared to be a massive sinkhole.“We managed to get 50 people out of their houses last night,” said Frank Rock, the head of the county administration. “We know of 15 people who still need to be rescued.”Speaking to German broadcaster n-tv, Rock said that authorities had no precise number yet for how many had died.“One has to assume that under the circumstances some people didn’t manage to escape,” he said.Authorities said late Thursday that about 1,300 people in Germany were still listed missing, but cautioned that the high figure could be due to duplication of data and difficulties reaching people because of disrupted roads and phone connections.In a provisional tally, the Belgian death toll rose to 12, with 5 people still missing, local authorities and media report early Friday.The flash floods this week followed days of heavy rainfall which turned streams and streets into raging torrents that swept away cars and caused houses to collapse across the region.The governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, Armin Laschet, has called an emergency Cabinet meeting Friday. The 60-year-old’s handling of the flood disaster is widely seen as a test for his ambitions to succeed Merkel as chancellor in Germany’s national election on Sept. 26.Steinmeier called for greater efforts to combat global warming.“Only if we decisively take up the fight against climate change will we be able to limit the extreme weather conditions we are now experiencing,” he said.Experts say such disasters could become more common due to climate change.“Some parts of Western Europe ... received up to two months of rainfall in the space of two days. What made it worse is that the soils were already saturated by previous rainfall,” said Clare Nullis, spokesperson for the World Meteorological Organization.It was too soon to blame the floods and preceding heat wave on global warming rising global temperatures, she said, but added: “Climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme events. And many single events have been shown to be made worse by global warming.”Malu Dreyer, the governor of Rhineland-Palatinate state, said the disaster showed the need to speed up efforts to curb global warming.“Climate chance isn’t abstract anymore. We are experiencing it up close and painfully,” she told the Funke media group.She accused the Laschet and Merkel’s center-right Union bloc of hindering efforts to achieve greater greenhouse gas reductions in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy and a major emitter of planet-warming gases.Thousands of people remain homeless after their houses were destroyed or deemed at-risk by authorities, including several villages around the Steinbach reservoir that experts say could collapse under the weight of the floods.Defense Ministry spokesman Arne Collatz said the German military had deployed over 850 troops as of Friday morning, but the number is “rising significantly because the need is growing.” He said the ministry had triggered a “military disaster alarm,” a technical move that essentially decentralizes decisions on using equipment to commanders on the ground.Across the border in Belgium, most of the drowned were found around Liege, where the rains hit hardest. Skies were largely overcast in eastern Belgium, with hopes rising that the worst of the calamity was over.Italy sent a team of civil protection officials and firefighters, as well as rescue dinghies, to Belgium to help in the search for missing people from the devastating floods.The firefighters tweeted a photo of one team working in Tillf, south of Liege, to help evacuate residents of a home who were trapped by the rising waters.In the southern Dutch province of Limburg, which also has been hit hard by flooding, troops piled sandbags to strengthen a 1.1 kilometer (0.7 miles) stretch of dike along the Maas river and police helped evacuate some low-lying neighborhoods.Caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday night that the government was officially declaring flood-hit regions a disaster area, meaning businesses and residents are eligible for compensation for damage.Dutch King Willem-Alexander visited the region Thursday night and called the scenes “heart-breaking.”Meanwhile, sustained rainfall in Switzerland has caused several rivers and lakes to break their banks. Public broadcaster SRF reported that a flash flood swept away cars, flooded basements and destroyed small bridges in the northern villages of Schleitheim und Beggingen late Thursday.Erik Schulz, the mayor of the hard-hit German city of Hagen, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) northeast of Cologne, said there had been a wave of solidarity from other regions and ordinary citizens to help those affected by the devastating floods.“We have many, many citizens saying ‘I can offer a place to stay, where can I go to help, where can I registered, where can I bring my shovel and bucket?’,” he told n-tv. “The city is standing together and you can feel that.”____Associated Press writers Geir Moulson and Emily Schultheis in Berlin, Raf Casert in Brussels, Nicole Winfield in Rome, Angela Charlton in Paris, Mike Corder in The Hague and contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Biden To Restore Protections For America’s Largest National Forest", "text": "The Biden administration moved Thursday to reverse the Trump administration’s dismantling of protections in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest.The U.S Department of Agriculture announced its intent to “repeal or replace” a Trump-era rule that obliterated protections for Tongass by lifting Clinton-era logging restrictions across 9.3 million forested acres and reclassifying 188,000 acres, including 168,000 acres of old-growth timber, as immediately suitable for harvesting.While the agency’s announcement was limited on details, it said it will end large-scale commercial logging of old-growth timber within the forest and instead “focus management resources to support forest restoration, recreation and resilience, including for climate, wildlife habit and watershed improvement.” Limited harvesting of old-growth trees would be permitted for community and cultural use, including for constructing totem poles and canoes.“This approach will help us chart the path to long-term economic opportunities that are sustainable and reflect Southeast Alaska’s rich cultural heritage and magnificent natural resources,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.The agency also plans to invest $25 million in community and economic development, it said.Many environmentalists see safeguarding the 17-million-acre Tongass National Forest, known as “America’s Amazon,” as critical to fighting against global climate change. It stores about 8% of the total carbon isolated in forests in the Lower 48 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and an astonishing 44% of all carbon stored in national forests across the United States.Thursday’s action stems from an executive order that President Joe Biden signed his first day in office directing the Department of Agriculture to review Trump’s rollback in Tongass. It came as welcome news for conservationists, some of whom had grown frustrated in recent months by the administration’s lack of a strong commitment to halt logging of mature and old temperate forests in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.“Once they are gone, these are trees that have stored [carbon] for hundreds of years, it will take that long to gain it back,” Beverly Law, a professor emeritus at Oregon State and an expert on the forest carbon cycle, told HuffPost in May. “It also means that most of that carbon is going to go back to the atmosphere in the next few decades. And that’s not going to help us get any closer to meeting our climate goals. It’s going to make the situation worse.”The announcement comes one day after Brazilian researchers found that parts of the Amazon rainforest in South America are now emitting more planet-warming carbon dioxide than they absorb, a signal that the world’s largest rainforest may have reached a tipping point. Biden has sought to pressure Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, to curb deforestation in the Amazon, only to have the Brazilian government point out the United States’ own history of intensively logging.“With Alaska experiencing climate impacts more acutely than most, we shouldn’t be discussing the continued clearcutting of a natural climate solution that exists right in our own backyard,” Andy Moderow of the Alaska Wilderness League said in a statement Thursday. “Alaskans love their old-growth forests and the timber industry in Southeast is now a relic of the past, and the Biden administration should be commended for looking forward to what kind of world we want to leave to our kids. The Tongass is an unmatched treasure and with smart action now we can properly manage it for future generations.”"}, {"title": "Poll: Most People Don’t Realize Their Homes Spew Carbon, But They Love The Fixes", "text": "Few U.S. voters realize the gas and oil used to power their homes and appliances spew huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.But vast majorities of voters across party lines want the federal government to help them buy and install electric stoves, heaters and other appliances that would reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and eliminate emissions.That’s according to a new survey of 1,264 likely voters from the polling group Data for Progress and the advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America.The findings, from a national poll taken between July 7-9, could buoy support for the new legislation Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is set to introduce Thursday that would add rebates for new energy-efficient or zero-carbon appliances and heating systems into the federal spending legislation lawmakers are currently negotiating.Just 15% of those surveyed estimated that household energy usage produced “a lot” of emissions, with most estimating that decisions made around the proverbial dinner table ― about what car to drive, what stove to buy, and what kind of furnace to heat the water in the shower ― affect, at most, only 20% of the country’s climate-changing pollution.In reality, that number is closer to 37%, according to data from Rewiring America, a nonprofit founded by a MacArthur “genius” who conducted the first total accounting of all U.S. energy use and emissions. To keep global warming from reaching catastrophic levels, countries, especially rich ones like the U.S., need to rapidly eliminate fossil fuel use ― and that means electrifying virtually every home and automobile.Considering that most people replace equipment in their homes only when it breaks down, roughly every 15 years or so, that mass electrification will likely depend on policies to make efficient, carbon-free appliances the obvious choice over fossil-fueled ones.“We will not solve the climate crisis unless we electrify all the households in the U.S.,” said Ari Matusiak, the chief executive of Rewiring America.“The water heater in your basement is going to conk out at some point. When it does, let’s make sure you get the efficient, electric one, because when you do that, you’ve locked in the zero-emissions pathway strategy in your house for the next 15 years,” he added. “Conversely, if you buy the fossil fuel replacement, you lock in that replacement for 15 years.”The survey suggested American voters, despite the knowledge gap about household pollution, support policies that make the zero-emissions pathway preferable.Just 24% of voters supported rebates for gas appliances, compared to 65% who said they’d prefer the government to offer cost-cutting kickbacks for electric versions, including 72% of Democrats, 65% of independents and 56% of Republicans.Asked whether they’d support “a new bill to make it easier and more affordable to purchase electric appliances” through “rebates for the purchase and installation of zero-emission and energy-efficient appliances, 71% of voters said they’d back the legislation. Posed that way, the proposition was even more popular, with 83% support from Democrats, 68% from independents, and 60% from Republicans.When asked if they’d participate in the program, either as homeowners or renters requesting landlords take part, 64% of voters said yes, including 76% of Democrats, 59% of independents, and 54% of Republicans.Another 51% of voters “strongly agreed” that the federal government should count homes, “including rental units, as part of our nation’s infrastructure when making decisions about new federal investments in infrastructure.” The issue appeared more polarized along partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats in support compared to 41% of independents and 39% of Republicans, though nearly one-fifth of voters in each category responded to that question by stating they “don’t know.”“If we do this right, and we make the right investments to catalyze this market transformation, it will be the thing people decide to do as a matter of course,” Matusiak said. “It will not be an ideological decision, where there are red-state furnaces and blue-state furnaces.”The fight over emissions from buildings has grown increasingly partisan as industry groups reluctant to cut pollution tighten their grip on the building code rule-making process at the state level.A growing number of cities where Democrats hold power, including San Francisco and Seattle, have banned new buildings from hooking up to gas lines, forcing developers to electrify the structures. But more than a dozen states Republicans control have considered or passed laws to ban such bans.Meanwhile, the private consortium that sets model building codes adopted in all 50 states recently gave gas utilities more power over the next round of energy-efficiency rules, set to come into effect in 2024. Real estate developers’ opposition to electrifying new homes tends to be rooted in concerns over the cost of non-gas appliances.“That is now money that can be pumped back into the economy in the form of discretionary spending,” Matusiak said, referring to the potential benefits of the Heinrich legislation. “And we’re talking about economic activity that is necessarily local. You can’t automate or offshore the insulation or furnace installation.”"}, {"title": "Oh Great, Now We Have To Worry About A Potentially Devastating 'Moon Wobble'", "text": "The moon may look like a peaceful neighbor, but scientists are warning that it may be trying to kill us.“In the mid-2030s, every U.S. coast will experience rapidly increasing high-tide floods, when a lunar cycle will amplify rising sea levels caused by climate change,” NASA warned in a new report.Thank the moon’s 18.6-year “wobble” cycle, which has been observed for some 300 years.When it wobbles one way, the high tides are lower. When it wobbles the other, however, the high tides are even higher, which could be especially destructive as sea levels rise.“We’re going to have sort of a double-whammy,” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer William Sweet, one of the study’s authors, told The Washington Post. “It means that coastal communities — unless they adapt and fortify — are likely to expect even greater flooding than they might otherwise.”NOAA reported 600 floods caused by high tides along the East Coast and Gulf Coast in 2019 alone. The coming wobble could worsen that, leading to “dramatic increases in flood numbers” in coastal cities around the nation.“We’re getting closer and closer to the flooding thresholds or tipping point in these coastal locations,” NASA Sea Level Change Team leader Ben Hamlington told NPR. “The same variability in the past that didn’t cause flooding is now going to cause flooding.”There could even be “clusters” of floods, sometimes lasting a month or more, NASA said.Just one region may escape the threat ― for now.“Only far northern coastlines, including Alaska’s, will be spared for another decade or longer because these land areas are rising due to long-term geological processes,” NASA said.Tidal floods involve less water than those caused by major weather events, such as storms, and are often taken less seriously as a result.“But if it floods 10 or 15 times a month, a business can’t keep operating with its parking lot underwater,” Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii and the lead author of the new study, said in a news release. “People lose their jobs because they can’t get to work. Seeping cesspools become a public health issue.”In response, NASA has created a “Sea Level Portal” to project what could happen in the future, which includes tools to anticipate flooding."}, {"title": "Couple Finds 'Momma' Snake And 17 Little Snakes Under Bed", "text": "A Georgia couple had a bit of a sssscare on Sunday when they came face to face with a large snake family under the bed.Trish Wilcher thought she saw a “piece of fuzz” on the floor under the bed in her home in Augusta, but when she reached for it, it suspiciously moved.“And then a second later another piece moved, and I went to my husband, ‘We have snakes!’” she told local news station WJBF.In fact, they had 18 snakes.“Ok we have turned the bedroom upside down… found 17 babies and the momma,” she posted on Facebook amid the slithery ordeal.Her husband, Max Wilcher, was able to use a grabbing tool to contain the snakes in a linen bag. He released them outside near a creek, she told WJBF. A wildlife catcher later told the couple that the reptiles in their home were non-venomous garter snakes.Georgia has both venomous and non-venomous snakes, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The agency notes that snakes are an important part of the ecosystem “because of their major role as both a predator and prey.”Snakes coming into people’s homes is relatively common, Georgia DNR biologist Daniel Sollenberger told the Augusta Chronicle, noting that they can come in through “small cracks” or open spaces such as holes around pipes under sinks. It’s common for snakes to come inside if a home has a mouse problem, in which case he noted that the snakes might actually be helpful.Non-venomous snakes are safe to shoo outside using a broom and bucket, Sollenberger said. But if you’re unsure whether the snake is venomous, he recommended calling someone licensed to remove wildlife."}, {"title": "Thousands Of Fish Burst From Plane And Plummet Into Lake In Mesmerizing Video", "text": "Wildlife officials in Utah restocked lakes across the state last week by giving some fish a free skydiving session.A viral video released by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources this month shows one of the agency’s planes flying over a lake by Utah’s Boulder Mountain on July 6. Suddenly, the plane’s hatch opens and out tumble thousands of young brook trout and tiger trout (called fingerlings, per The New York Times) in a torrent of water. The creatures twist and turn and flop about until they disappear under the lake’s surface. The airplane holds hundreds of pounds of water and can drop 35,000 fish in a single flight without reloading, according to a Facebook post  by the agency.Surprisingly, there’s nothing fishy about the practice. Aerial fish stocking has been used in the Beehive State since the mid-1950s, according to the agency’s post. It is also used to repopulate species, because fish don’t reproduce naturally in many of Utah’s lakes. The “planes are just the most efficient way to provide fish for anglers,” Chris Penne, a regional aquatic manager for the wildlife division, told the Times.The agency stocked around 200 high-elevation lakes across the state using this extreme and “effective” fish drop method, per the Facebook post. It is used because many of the lakes in the state are not accessible by vehicle.The post also noted that very few fish were likely harmed in the filming of its video, and that “post-stocking netting surveys show that survival of aerial-stocked fish is incredibly high.” The agency told the Times that the fingerlings have a 95% survival rate, if you want to get specific.“The fish are between 1-3 inches long, so they flutter down slowly to the water,” the agency said on Facebook."}, {"title": "Western Wildfires Threatening American Indian Tribal Lands", "text": "BLY, Ore. (AP) — Fierce wildfires in the northwest are threatening American Indian tribal lands that already are struggling to conserve water and preserve traditional hunting grounds in the face of a Western drought.Blazes in Oregon and Washington were among some 60 large, active wildfires that have destroyed homes and burned through close to a million acres (1,562 square miles, 4,047 square kilometers) in a dozen mostly Western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.In north-central Washington, hundreds of people in the town of Nespelem on the Colville Indian Agency were ordered to leave because of “imminent and life-threatening” danger as the largest of five wildfires caused by dozens of Monday night lightning strikes tore through grass, sagebrush and timber.Seven homes burned but four were vacant and the entire town evacuated safely before the fire arrived, said Andrew Joseph Jr., chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation that includes more than 9,000 descendants of a dozen tribes.Monte Piatote and his wife grabbed their pets and managed to flee but watched the fire burn the home where he’d lived since he was a child.“I told my wife, I told her, ‘Watch.’ Then boom, there it was,” Piatote told KREM-TV.The confederation declared a state of emergency Tuesday and said the reservation was closed to the public and to industrial activity. The declaration said weather forecasts called for possible triple-digit temperatures and 25-mph (40-kph) winds on Wednesday into Thursday that could drive the flames.In Oregon, the lightning-sparked Bootleg Fire that had destroyed at least 20 homes was raging through lands near the California border on Wednesday. At least 2,000 homes were threatened by the fire.Mark Enty, a spokesman for the Northwest Incident Management Team 10 that is working to contain the fire, said that since he arrived to the area last week the Bootleg Fire has doubled in size each day.“That’s sort of like having a new fire every day,” Enty said.The blaze had spread over 315 square miles (816 square kilometers), an area larger than New York City. Firefighters for the third day in a row had to back off occasionally for their safety and “weather isn’t going to change for the foreseeable future,” said Rob Allen, an incident commander.Crews were facing above-normal temperatures and bone-dry humidity coupled with afternoon gusts that were expected to create dangerous fire conditions through Wednesday, officials said. Members of the Oregon National Guard were expected to be deployed to help with road closures and traffic control in fire-affected areas.The fire disrupted three transmission lines that provide electricity to California and the state’s power grid operator asked for voluntary power conservation Monday. The California Independent System Operator said Tuesday that the grid was stable and with the forecast for cooler temperatures another call for conservation was not expected.The fire in the Fremont-Winema National Forest was burning through a region where the Klamath Tribes — comprised of three distinct indigenous peoples — have lived for millennia.“There is definitely extensive damage to the forest where we have our treaty rights,” said Don Gentry, the chairman of the Klamath Tribal Council in Chiloquin, Oregon, which is located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Bootleg Fire.“I am sure we have lost a number of deer to the fire,” he said. “We are definitely concerned. I know there are cultural resource areas and sensitive areas that are likely the fire is going through.”The Klamath Tribes have been impacted by wildfires before, including one that burned 23 square miles (60 square kilometers) in southern Oregon last September. That fire damaged land where many of the Klamath tribal members hunt, fish and gather. The fire also burned the tribes’ cemetery and at least one tribal member’s house, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported in September.The tribes are struggling with drought-caused problems. In past decades, they have fought to preserve minimum water levels in Upper Klamath Lake to preserve two species of federally endangered sucker fish that are central to their culture and heritage. Farmers draw much of their irrigation water from the same lake that’s critical to the fish. Even before the fire erupted, extreme drought in southern Oregon had reduced water flows to historic lows.In California, progress was reported on the state’s largest fire so far this year. The Beckwourth Complex, a combined pair of lighting-ignited blazes, was almost 50% contained after blackening more than 145 square miles (375 square kilometers) near the Nevada state line.Damage was still being tallied in the small rural community of Doyle, California, where flames swept in during the weekend and destroyed several homes, including Beverly Houdyshell’s.The 79-year-old said Tuesday that she’s too old and too poor to rebuild and isn’t sure what her future holds.“What chance do I have to build another house, to have another home?” Houdyshell said. “No chance at all.”“I can’t just buy another house, boom like that. I had insurance. I haven’t heard from them yet. I called them but I haven’t heard nothing.”A fire that began Sunday in the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite National Park grew to nearly 15 square miles (39 square kilometers) but containment increased to 15%. Four unspecified buildings were destroyed.Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier, and they warn that weather will get wilder as the world warms. They say extreme conditions are often from a combination of unusually random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change. However, special studies are needed to determine how much global warming is to blame, if at all, for a single extreme weather event.___Cline reported from Salem, Oregon.

The makers of these bars say their products are essentially all the good parts of shampoo (the stuff that gets your hair clean and beautiful) without a bunch of non-essential water added — and with no plastic bottle required.“Liquid shampoo contains 80 to 90% water,” Superzero founder and co-CEO Conny Wittke told HuffPost. “The amount of plastic used in the beauty industry is significant, creating 120 billion units of plastic packaging waste every year globally. In the United States, 552 million plastic shampoo bottles are sold every year. But overall, less than 10% of the plastic we create gets recycled.”Removing the water from shampoo formulations leaves consumers with one small bar that can contain the equivalent of up to three bottles of shampoo, enough for up to 80 washes, depending on the brand. Then there’s the issue of what it takes to get that bottle transported from a factory to your shower stall. “Because you get more product for less weight and volume with shampoo bars, there are fewer greenhouse gases generated during shipping,” Wittke said.How significant is that impact? “One of our shampoo bars has just 8% of the carbon footprint of the equivalent liquid product,”said Brianne West, founder and CEO of Ethique. Allison Teasdale, the chief operating officer of Unwrapped Life, noted: “We’ve diverted more than 4.5 million plastic bottles from entering our oceans, and we’re committed to preventing more than 20 million plastic bottles by 2025.”Is there a shampoo bar in your future? It seems likely. “Everyone who uses shampoo eventually will use them,” said HiBar co-founder Dion Hughes. “I foresee a time when using shampoo from plastic bottles is as uncool as lighting a cigarette in a restaurant.”You’ll need to manage your expectations with your first few bar uses, starting with the volume of lather you’re likely to see. There’s a “theater of lather” that we’ve come to expect from our cleansing products, but the additives that provide a rich lather aren’t necessarily proof of super-deep cleaning. “Lather is not so much a cleansing effect as a reassuring effect,” Hughes said.“You’ll notice that your shampoo bar will suds up, but it’s not like the kind of foam you see in a beer commercial, more just a creamy lather,” Shambar founder Jeffrey Qaiyum told HuffPost. “If you’re getting that much foam from a shampoo bar, frankly, you’re using a bar of soap with the word ‘shampoo’ slapped on the label.”How that small, hard bar will translate into a good shampoo might seem confusing at first, but after a few tries, you’ll get the hang of it. “Just swoosh the entire bar around on your head,” said Erica Vega, brand and product expert for Lush Cosmetics USA . “If your hair is prone to tangles, rub it in your hands first, then rub the lather in, the way you would do with a liquid shampoo.”After rinsing and drying, your hair might look a little different than the way it does after a traditional shampoo, at least at first. Shampoo bars tend to be gentler than shampoo, so you’ll need to let your hair adjust to that milder cleansing, or you might eventually need to switch up the timing and frequency of your shampoos. “For some people, it takes two to three weeks to ‘break in’ and let the hair become normalized after years of having natural oils stripped away by shampoos,” said James R. Liggett, president and founder of J. R. Liggett’s.Whether you’ll need a conditioner bar is a matter of your particular hair type. Someone with short hair might be just fine, but those with thicker, longer or curlier hair might want to use one.“Many people with curly hair choose not to use shampoo in favor of co-washing, which is washing with conditioner,” West said. She noted that those products also have eco-benefits. “One of our conditioner bars is equivalent to five bottles of liquid conditioner,” she added.Because of their compact size, shampoo bars make sense for travel. They eliminate worries about Transportation Security Administration requirements because — ta-da! — you’ve ditched the liquid altogether. Whether you’re staying at a luxury hotel or at a campsite, you’ll also find that a shampoo bar is a good in-a-pinch way to care for hand-washable clothing when you’re on the road.People can use the bars on their entire bodies, or as a replacement for shaving cream. And you can break them out when it’s time to wash pets, too. No matter what you’re doing with your own particular bar, “They’re absolutely gentle enough to use every day,” Qaiyum said.HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Spokespeople for Coons and Sinema said including those contributions in the total was “misleading” and “inaccurate.”But Collin Rees, the senior campaigner at Oil Change U.S. who conducted the analysis, said the donations paint a fuller picture of Exxon Mobil’s influence taking stock of the relationships the company’s money helped cultivate as well as those that may have prompted the oil giant to hire certain lobbyists in the first place.“This is a story about how lobbyists curry favor, and specifically about how Exxon’s current lobbyists have spent decades currying the favor of these six Democrats to position themselves to do things like safeguard fossil fuel subsidies and pare down infrastructure packages,” Rees said. “Exxon has hired these firms and lobbyists because they’ve contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to these Democrats, both before and after they were hired by Exxon.”Counting donations from lobbyists like Arshi Siddiqui, some of which came before Exxon Mobil hired her, makes Sinema the No. 2 recipient on the list, with $70,800 in contributions from eight Exxon Mobil lobbyists, the company PAC and three lobbying firms.“Inclusion of those contributions would be incredibly misleading,” John LaBombard, a spokesman for Sinema, said of money that came from lobbyists who also work for other clients. “Kyrsten’s work in the Senate is influenced by only one thing: what is best for Arizona.”Coons came in third with $68,650 from seven lobbyists, the PAC and four lobbying firms.“One of the other ones that aren’t talked about is Senator Coons, who’s from Delaware, who has a very close relationship with Senator Biden,” McCoy said in the now-viral video, in which he believed he was talking to corporate headhunters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “So we’ve been working with his office. As a matter of fact, our CEO is talking to him next Tuesday.”It’s unclear whether a meeting with Exxon Mobil chief Darren Woods took place.Manchin, meanwhile, received the fourth-most donations, at $64,864, followed by Hassan at $26,699. Kelly, who took office last December and declined all corporate PAC money, accepted just $1,500, which came from two Exxon-registered lobbyists.“On the Democrat side, we look for the moderates,” McCoy said. “So it’s the Manchins. It’s the Sinemas. It’s the Testers.”Beyond seeking out right-leaning senators, McCoy said the company looked for “who’s up for reelection in 2022?”“That’s Hassan,” he said. “That’s Kelly.”A spokeswoman for Hassan pointed to the senator’s 98% voting score from the League of Conservation Voters and noted that “the video only says that Senator Hassan is up for re-election ... it isn’t for her support of their policies but simply because she is up for re-election.”A spokesman for Kelly said: “Senator Kelly has not met with the individual in the original Exxon video, and hasn’t spoken with anyone from this company in the Senate. Senator Kelly also does not accept corporate PAC contributions to his campaign.”Tester’s office did not provide a comment.Exxon Mobil said it “complies with all federal and state regulations and lobbying laws.”“We have a responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to represent their interests in public policy discussions that impact our business,” said Todd Spitler, an Exxon Mobil spokesman. He said McCoy’s remarks “do not represent the company’s position on a variety of issues, including comments regarding interactions with elected officials.”In the video, McCoy said Exxon Mobil is “playing defense” as the Biden administration and its slim Democratic majority in Congress seek to enact the country’s most significant climate legislation ever, including voting on an infrastructure package with billions of dollars for clean energy and electric vehicles as well as looking to pass a 100% clean electricity standard through budget reconciliation.The push comes amid cascading climate disasters ― from deadly heat waves on one coast to historic flooding on the other ― that scientists say will grow worse and more frequent if fossil fuel use continues unabated. Even the International Energy Agency, hardly a tree-hugging institution, projects that averting catastrophic warming means “from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects.”But influence peddling is nothing new for the $258 billion company, which served as one of the chief financiers of a network of climate denial think tanks throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Today, Exxon Mobil funds trade associations that lobby against climate policies while offering a rhetorical contrast to oil giants that advocate for politically unpopular proposals unlikely to reach fruition in a bid to look like responsible actors.Donations don’t necessarily equal political clout. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), one of the lead champions of ending fossil fuel use, previously accepted campaign contributions from lobbyists linked to Exxon Mobil. He returned them in 2019, but the incident highlighted just how tightly woven oil companies are into the fabric of American politics and, as a result, how difficult it can be to avoid threads that ultimately lead back to the fossil fuel industry.But a 2017 Ohio State University study indicates the donations have a measurable effect, particularly as they enter the five-figure range. For every $10,000 a lawmaker received from a major industrial polluter like Exxon Mobil, their probability of voting for pro-environmental legislation decreased by 2%, according to the study of donations between 1990 and 2010 published in the journal Environmental Politics. For Democrats, the effect of the donations was even stronger, reducing likelihood of a pro-environmental vote by 3%.Regardless of whether it swings votes, firms like Exxon Mobil give “money to secure access to politicians,” said Tyson Slocum, the energy program director at the anti-corruption group Public Citizen.“While securing access doesn’t guarantee results, it ensures the company can influence the thinking and positions taken by the politician receiving the money,” Slocum said, noting that he condemned Greenpeace UK’s “deceptive tactics” to dupe McCoy. “And the result shows that Exxon does indeed appear to influence these and other elected officials to which it contributes.”Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the watchdog Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said corporate lobbyists “expect something in return” when they make political donations.“As a result, when Exxon’s lobbyists, PACs and lobbying firms make donations to particular senators, we have to ask ourselves what do they expect and what did they get in return,” said Canter, a former ethics counsel for the Obama and Clinton administrations.The sting video has prompted new scrutiny of Exxon Mobil beyond its campaign contributions. The New Republic examined the company’s routine six-figure donations to centrist think tanks such as the Brookings Institution. On Monday, the advocacy group Physicians for Social Responsibility published a new report indicating that the oil giant uses so-called forever chemicals ― a family of cancer-causing water contaminants known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS ― to drill at roughly 1,200 wells across six U.S. states.If Exxon Mobil’s use of PFAS were more widely known, McCoy said in one part of the video, environmentalists would likely “start talking about how this is an Exxon Mobil chemical and Exxon Mobil is poisoning our waterways.”Once the public accepts that framing of reality, he said, “the debate is pretty much over.”"}, {"title": "Florida Manatee Deaths Shatter Yearly Record With 6 Months To Go", "text": "At least 841 manatees have died in Florida waters during the first half of 2021, an unprecedented level of mortality that has already shattered the previous record for an entire year.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s preliminary data points to a decline in seagrass that the manatees eat as the main cause. The previous annual record was set in 2013, when 830 manatees died over 12 months due to a toxic red tide.“Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,” the commission said in its report. “Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon where the majority of seagrass has died off. The long-term health effects of prolonged starvation in manatees that survived the Atlantic event to this point are not yet known.”Manatees eat about 10% of their body weight in vegetation each day, grazing across large, underwater seagrass meadows. But the plants are particularly vulnerable to water pollution and have declined in the Indian River Lagoon region — a prime manatee feeding zone — due to poor water quality, algae blooms and extreme weather.In March, scientists warned that manatees were dying at an alarming rate due to a combination of cold weather and the loss of seagrass. The rate of death was significant enough at the time to be declared an unusual mortality event by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Boat strikes also remain a significant threat to manatees: 63 have been killed this year due to watercraft.In June, a coalition of environmental groups and businesses called on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to declare a state of emergency to protect manatees, saying the time had come “to act boldly and effectively to rehabilitate our waterways.”State officials, however, said such an act wasn’t necessary “at this time,” the TC Palm reported.The Associated Press notes that manatees were listed as endangered by the federal government, but rebounding numbers saw them downgraded to threatened in 2017. Some environmental groups have pointed to recent population declines as evidence the mammals should be afforded greater federal protection.There are an estimated 7,520 manatees living in Florida waters."}, {"title": "U.S. Drilling Approvals Increase Despite Biden Climate Pledge", "text": "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Approvals for companies to drill for oil and gas on U.S. public lands are on pace this year to reach their highest level since George W. Bush was president, underscoring President Joe Biden’s reluctance to more forcefully curb petroleum production in the face of industry and Republican resistance.The Interior Department approved about 2,500 permits to drill on public and tribal lands in the first six months of the year, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data. That includes more than 2,100 drilling approvals since Biden took office January 20.New Mexico and Wyoming had the largest number of approvals. Montana, Colorado and Utah had hundreds each.Biden campaigned last year on pledges to end new drilling on federal lands  to rein in climate-changing emissions. His pick to oversee those lands, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, adamantly opposed drilling on federal lands while in Congress and co-sponsored the liberal Green New Deal.But the steps taken by the administration to date on fossil fuels are more modest, including a temporary suspension on new oil and gas leases on federal lands that a judge blocked last month, blocked petroleum sales in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline  from Canada.Because vast fossil fuel reserves already are under lease, those actions did nothing to slow drilling on public lands and waters that account for about a quarter of U.S. oil production.Further complicating Biden’s climate agenda is a recent rise in gasoline prices to $3 a gallon ($0.79 a liter) or more in many parts of the country. Any attempt to limit petroleum production could push gasoline prices even higher and risk souring economic recovery from the pandemic.“He’s walking the tightrope,” said energy industry analyst Parker Fawcett with S&P Global Platts, noting that Keystone and ANWR came without huge political costs because they were aimed at future projects.“Those easy wins don’t necessarily have huge impacts on the market today,” Fawcett said. “He is definitely backing off taking drastic action that would rock the market. ... What you’re going to see is U.S. oil production is going to continue to rebound.”Haaland has sought to tamp down Republican concern over potential constraints on the industry. She said during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing last month that there was no “plan right now for a permanent ban.”“Gas and oil production will continue well into the future and we believe that is the reality of our economy and the world we’re living in,” Haaland told Colorado Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn.Interior officials declined further comment on permits issued under Biden.Under former President Donald Trump, a staunch industry supporter, the Interior Department reduced the time it takes to review drilling applications from a year or more in some cases, to just a few months.Companies rushed to  lock in drilling rights before the new administration. And in December, Trump’s last full month in office, agency officials approved more than 800 permits — far more than any prior month during his presidency.The pace dropped when Biden first took office, under a temporary order that elevated permit reviews to senior administration officials. Approvals have since rebounded to a level that exceeds monthly numbers seen through most of Trump’s presidency.The data obtained by AP from a government database is subject to change because of delays in transmitting data from Interior field offices to headquarters.If the recent trends continue, the Interior Department could issue close to 6,000 permits by the end of the year. The last time so many were issued was fiscal year 2008, amid an oil boom driven by crude prices that reached an all-time high of $140 per barrel that June.Decisions on about 4,700 drilling applications remained pending as of June 1, which means approvals are likely to continue at a heavy pace as officials work through a backlog left over from the Trump administration, said Fawcett, the industry analyst.Environmentalists who share the administration’s goals on climate have expressed growing frustration as prospects for a ban on drilling fade. They contend the administration could take executive action that would stop further permits but has caved to Republican pressure.“Every indication is they have no plans of actually fulfilling their campaign promise,” said Mitch Jones, policy director for the environmental group Food & Water Watch. “The result of that will be continued and increasing development of fossil fuels on public lands, which means more climate change.”Economists and other experts have been skeptical about how much impact a permit ban would have. Companies simply could shift onto private and state lands and keep drilling, said University of Chicago deputy dean Ryan Kellogg.The administration’s defenders say it’s being pragmatic in the face of a Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans and questions over whether the government could legally stop drilling on leases already sold to companies.That’s meant forgoing a drilling ban in hopes of getting bipartisan support for a huge infrastructure package that includes clean energy incentives and other measures to address global warming.“It’s the long game. ... You’ve got to appease some of those oil and gas state senators,” said Jim Lyons, who was deputy assistant Interior secretary under Barack Obama and is now an environmental consultant. “It means jobs back home for thousands of workers. You can’t just pull the plug overnight.”___Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: @MatthewBrownAP"}, {"title": "This Governor Withdrew From A Climate Pact. Days Later, He's Pleading For Help With Drought.", "text": "Montana’s Republican governor has made it clear his state won’t be bothered to help in the fight against climate change. But he still wants federal assistance to deal with the climate impacts at Montana’s door.Last week, Gov. Greg Gianforte withdrew Montana from a bipartisan coalition of more than two dozen states committed to upholding the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which include net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, told Montana Public Radio that the governor believes innovation, not government regulation, is the solution to climate change.Two days later, Gianforte called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare a drought emergency across his state, which would make emergency funds available to farmers who have suffered losses.“Data from the U.S. Drought Monitor now shows all counties in Montana experiencing abnormally dry to extreme drought conditions, and the situation continues to get worse,” Gianforte wrote on Twitter.The situation is indeed getting worse. Climate change is exacerbating heat waves and drought across the globe, making events more frequent and extreme. And the sweltering, dry conditions are feeding early season wildfires in Montana.Gianforte also shared a tweet from the state’s fire protection program about dangerous fire conditions across western Montana. “Let’s work together to reduce the burden on our first responders and use extreme caution when working and recreating outdoors,” Gianforte wrote.One way to lessen the burden on wildland firefighters would be to take the climate threat seriously. Wildfires are forecast to become increasingly severe as climate change drives up temperatures and fuels drought.Instead, Gianforte has blamed wildfires on “frivolous lawsuits from environmental extremists” and dismissed the scientific consensus that humans are the primary drivers of global climate change. In letters to at least two constituents while a member of Congress, he wrote that “the climate has been changing for millennia” and that “while the climate is changing, we still do not know how much of that change is due to human activities.”Frank Szollosi, executive director of conservation nonprofit Montana Wildlife Federation, said Gianforte’s actions demonstrate a “cognitive dissonance” and that withdrawing from the bipartisan alliance of governors is “an abdication of state leadership.”“Rivers in Montana are drying up this year, the fisheries are getting smoked, forest fires displace wildlife and there’s wildlife mortality — to say nothing of the personal property impact,” Szollosi said. “It’s just incongruent to try to stand with wildland firefighters when through the abdication of leadership on climate, you’re basically condemning the wildland firefighters of the future.”Gianforte’s wildfire message is as simplistic and incomplete as that of Smokey Bear, the Forest Service icon that for decades has been telling Americans “Only YOU can prevent wildfires” without discussing the benefits of natural fire on ecosystems and how climate change is impacting infernos. Business as usual in oil and gas production is one main reason states like Montana have found themselves choked in smoke every year.Gianforte’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Monday.It’s not hard to understand how ending Montana’s participation in a bipartisan climate coalition and walking away from its goals risks further harm to Montana residents, including the agricultural producers Gianforte is now asking the federal government to assist.“This drought didn’t come out of nowhere, and if the current drought and the last decade of extreme weather across the country don’t convince you we’re in a crisis right now and that we bold action to avert disaster today and for the future, then you’re cementing the risk for the communities in your state,” Michael Kelly, director of communications at Clean Water Action, said via email."}, {"title": "Florida Breaks Annual Manatee Death Record In First 6 Months", "text": "STUART, Fla. (AP) — More manatees have died already this year than in any other year in Florida’s recorded history, primarily from starvation due to the loss of seagrass beds, state officials said.The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission reported that 841 manatee deaths were recorded between Jan. 1 and July 2, breaking the previous record of 830 that died in 2013 because of an outbreak of toxic red tide.The TCPalm website reports that more than half the deaths have died in the Indian River Lagoon and its surrounding areas in Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties. The overwhelming majority of deaths have been in Brevard, where 312 manatees have perished.Some biologists believe water pollution is killing the seagrass beds in the area.“Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,” Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute wrote as it announced the record Friday. “Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon, where the majority of seagrass has died off.”Boat strikes are also a major cause of manatee deaths, killing at least 63 this year.The manatee was once classified as endangered by the federal government, but it was reclassified as threatened in 2017. Environmentalists are asking that the animal again be considered endangered.The federal government says approximately 6,300 manatees live in Florida waters, up from about 1,300 in the early 1990s."}, {"title": "Fires Rage In Several States As Heat Wave Broils U.S. West", "text": "Firefighters working in searing weather struggled to contain a Northern California wildfire that continued to grow Sunday and forced the closure of a major highway, one of several large blazes burning across the U.S. West amid another heat wave that shattered records and strained power grids.Two firefighters died Saturday in Arizona after a plane they were in crashed during a survey of a small wildfire in rural Mohave County. The aircraft was helping perform reconnaissance over the Cedar Basin Fire near Wikieup, a tiny community of about 100, when it went down around noon.The two firefighters were the only people on board, officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.In California, officials asked all residents to reduce power consumption quickly after a major wildfire in southern Oregon knocked out interstate power lines, preventing up to 4,000 megawatts of electricity from flowing into the state.The California Independent System Operator, which runs the state’s power grid, said Saturday the Bootleg Fire took three transmission lines off-line, straining electricity supplies as temperatures in the area soared.“The Bootleg Fire will see the potential for extreme growth today,” the National Weather Service in Medford, Oregon, tweeted Sunday.Pushed by strong winds, the Bootleg Fire exploded in size to 224 square miles (580 square kilometers) as it raced through heavy timber in Oregon’s Fremont-Winema National Forest near the Klamath County town of Sprague River.To the southeast, the largest wildfire of the year in California was raging along the border with Nevada. The Beckwourth Complex Fire — a combination of two lightning-caused blazes burning 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Lake Tahoe — showed no sign of slowing its rush northeast from the Sierra Nevada forest region after doubling in size between Friday and Saturday.Late Saturday, flames jumped a major highway, U.S. 395, which was closed near the small town of Doyle in California’s Lassen County. Flames threatened rural properties and forced evacuations in Nevada’s Washoe County. “Take immediate steps to protect large animals and livestock,” the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District tweeted.The blaze, which was only 9% contained, increased to 131 square miles (339 square kilometers). Temperatures in the area could top 100 degrees (37 Celsius) again Sunday.It was one of several fires threatening homes across Western states that were expected to see triple-digit heat through the weekend as a high-pressure zone blankets the region.Death Valley in southeastern California’s Mojave Desert reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit (53 Celsius) on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service’s reading at Furnace Creek. The shockingly high temperature was actually lower than the previous day, when the location reached 130 F (54 C).If confirmed as accurate, the 130-degree reading would be the hottest high recorded there since July 1913, when Furnace Creek desert hit 134 F (57 C), considered the highest measured temperature on Earth.The National Weather Service warned the dangerous conditions could cause heat-related illnesses.Palm Springs in Southern California hit a record high temperature of 120 F (49 C) Saturday. It was the fourth time temperatures have reached 120 degrees so far this year, the Desert Sun reported.In California’s agricultural Central Valley, 100-degree temperatures blanketed the region, with Fresno reaching 111 degrees F (44 C), just one degree short of the all-time high for the date.Las Vegas late Saturday afternoon tied the all-time record high of 117 F (47 C), the National Weather Service said. The city has recorded that record-high temperature four other times, most recently in June 2017.NV Energy, Nevada’s largest power provider, also urged customers to conserve electricity Saturday and Sunday evenings because of the heat wave and wildfires affecting transmission lines throughout the region.In Southern California, a brush fire sparked by a burning big rig in eastern San Diego County forced evacuations of two Native American reservations Saturday.In north-central Arizona, Yavapai County on Saturday lifted an evacuation warning for Black Canyon City, an unincorporated town 43 miles (66 kilometers) north of Phoenix, after a fire in nearby mountains no longer posed a threat.A wildfire in southeast Washington grew to almost 60 square miles (155 square kilometers) as it blackened grass and timber while it moved into the Umatilla National Forest.In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little declared a wildfire emergency Friday and mobilized the state’s National Guard to help fight fires sparked after lightning storms swept across the drought-stricken region.___Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen in San Francisco, Martha Bellisle in Seattle and Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report."}, {"title": "Pacific Northwest Heat Wave Made Baby Hawks Hurl Themselves Out Of Nests", "text": "The extreme heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in late June that left hundreds of people dead and cooked up to 1 billion sea creatures alive also caused dozens of baby hawks to hurl themselves out of their nests.“They had no choice,” Oregon wildlife rehabber Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.”Tompkins’ wildlife rehabilitation center, Blue Mountain Wildlife, took in around 50 nestling hawks too young to fly that had launched themselves earthward in a desperate bid to escape the heat. The scorching temperatures were just one example of  climate-change-related extreme weather in recent weeks.Thirteen of the chicks had to be euthanized because their injuries were so severe. A blog post from the rehab center noted that the surviving birds were doing well and “eating an incredible amount of food.”Similar things happened in British Columbia, where OWL Orphaned Wildlife Rehabilitation Society experienced a “new high” when it came to baby birds in distress.“We’re about 140 birds over this same period last time,” rehab center general manager Rob Hope told CTC News Vancouver. “Unfortunately the little guys, because it got so hot, they had no choice but to try and cool off and they were getting themselves into trouble.
